The thing is having a team in a city like portland we need to draft way better than everyone else. We can't get players to move here as we saw ever so recently with this past off season.

It also goes to show how a strong organization is important. Cuz Mitchell didn’t want to workout for the Jazz prior to the draft cuz they were picking 24th.

Anytime you got a name like pimp you gotta keep him around ,48,534453181875545280,+15035806566
Coach pimp is dope,48,534453171479552000,+15035806566
It would be nice to keep him but ya he’s out too,42,534452680706875776,+15035043582
Woodie too,413,534452526306130880,+15035107079
Yeah ,413,534452523679965760,+15035107079
They need to kick coach pimp out today,42,534451674704247232,+15035043582
That is big,413,534451643224625856,+15035107079
He was a big recruiter ,413,534451634394427072,+15035107079
Guys Coach Hayward is staying now too,413,534451629899149440,+15035107079
Did ainge outsmart us all again. Unloading that pick right before the nets stopped being a doormat ,48,534451524699994816,+15035806566

We’re moving to Sacramento boys,210,534450853104837888,+15039972480
I mean maybe? The nets just keep winning,25,534450343826668992,+15035513466
So the Cavs need to flip that Brooklyn pick this year right ,0,534450311544227392,
And Ben hates Neil,25,534448769451112512,+15035513466
Also I had lunch with Ben Golliver in LA and he told me he thinks it was Paul ,25,534448736752927552,+15035513466
And see if I can get people to spill the tea 🍵 ,25,534448697144638272,+15035513466
I hope I’ll start going to more games after Xmas ,25,534448668651867648,+15035513466
Find out who’s pick it was,48,534448640054303872,+15035806566
You gotta get to the bottom of this,48,534448636020738368,+15035806566
He might just be better at managing up than the past guys ,25,534448460007937408,+15035513466
I mean the fact Neil still has his job is pretty wild given Paul’s track record ,25,534448447289779200,+15035513466
And the job ,25,534448425094525120,+15035513466
Or got strong armed and wanted to secure the bag ,25,534448418986285184,+15035513466
"Same. If it was Paul that explains a lot. But if it was Neil’s call, that’s a fireable offense ",48,534448413840970496,+15035806566
Neil either lost his mind ,25,534448409687941568,+15035513466
God I really wanna fucking find out whose choice this was now ,25,534448382075207232,+15035513466
Seriously. I don’t get it,48,534448382074829312,+15035806566
Woj Said GM’s are telling him Mitchell has d Wade trajectory. And both guys said Mitchell was rated higher than Monk in the draft,48,534448334355736512,+15035806566
That makes me wonder if Paul had a thing for Collins ,25,534448333749336256,+15035513466
And Olshey always talks about how much emphasis they put on that,48,534448300556371200,+15035806566
😭,25,534448299929839360,+15035513466
He said that all the psychological professionals at the combine said Donovan Mitchell was BY FAR and away the number 1 guy in the draft ,48,534448289196838848,+15035806566
How much is he shutting on the blazers picks ,25,534448288947756032,+15035513466
Oh man ,25,534448277488596672,+15035513466
Jesus Christ Gundy. Listening to the new woj podcast with Jonathan givony,48,534448252374300928,+15035806566
Les Miles has been to Cuba,66,534447310097958080,+15039100235
I think Arroyo is gonna be the OC ,413,534447233539609216,+15035107079
The marching band will be replaced by the Buena Vista Social Club,25,534446880366144640,+15035513466
Puddles is gonna ditch the motorcycle and instead enter the field on a 1950’s bright colored vintage car,66,534446848454392640,+15039100235

Black beans and rice era has begun ,66,534446796525567744,+15039100235
I wanted sumlin personally ,48,534446540063423168,+15035806566
And he’s recruited like 9 five stars in his time there,48,534446525215621440,+15035806566
He coached in the hardest conference in American and went 9-4 after manziel and then three straight 8-5 seasons. He’s a legit coach,48,534446515294502976,+15035806566
He’s already making his full contract from A&M,42,534446108073812736,+15035043582
I don’t think it would happen but he could be OC,42,534446090726548928,+15035043582
He lost 2 5 Star qbs one after another so that hurt him playing with a new freshman each year,42,534446072307742144,+15035043582
I heard that too ,25,534445874727583168,+15035513466
Emphasized “I thought Sumlin’s knock was that he hadn’t done anything since manziel ”,25,534445870747457024,+15035513466
Don’t follow A&M,120,534445821006852416,+14153064486
Idk though ,120,534445812665511872,+14153064486
I thought Sumlin’s knock was that he hadn’t done anything since manziel ,120,534445810287681344,+14153064486
He also can recruit Florida ,413,534445008532171456,+15035107079
Yes he does,413,534445000018023488,+15035107079
He has a dope name tho ,35,534444958502998336,+14252837314
Like if all of them and it sounds like the assistants feel the same then I can’t be that upset,413,534444948127663104,+15035107079
I'm just reserving judgement ,35,534444942517422656,+14252837314
Like I just hear how the players think of him and that sold me,413,534444937307471296,+15035107079
I didn't say I hate it ,35,534444931318177216,+14252837314
But hey ,35,534444927455012352,+14252837314
I felt sumlin could've helped our offense explode ,35,534444924619155648,+14252837314
He just had some bad seasons sprinkled in with some shitty sanctions ,413,534444924373117696,+15035107079
I think recruits like him,25,534444909156866816,+15035513466
Yeah I Mena he DID win at FIU,413,534444907415210944,+15035107079
But it's hard to know,35,534444897274938112,+14252837314
And that is was bama ,35,534444890788345344,+14252837314
I know that's important,35,534444887019902016,+14252837314
I'm just saying two years ago he was an o-line coach ,35,534444883494115328,+14252837314
We will see ,35,534444852887893184,+14252837314
Hey Willie didn’t either,413,534444850419409024,+15035107079
That's dope ,35,534444850099006656,+14252837314
If he can hold onto recruits ,35,534444847362854976,+14252837314
Doesn't feel like a big splash ,35,534444840583863488,+14252837314
Yeah I dunno cristobal is just unproven ,35,534444829682528704,+14252837314
Like the minute he’d be up for an SEC job would he split? ,413,534444792454076032,+15035107079
I would’ve been down for that but Sumlin also makes me weary in terms of leaving,413,534444779672221632,+15035107079
I guess we’ll probably find out in the coming weeks if he actually wanted it or not,413,534444765026055360,+15035107079
Yeah maybe not ,35,534444761030196160,+14252837314
Yeah I don’t know if that was actually on the table. ,413,534444751155123456,+15035107079
I said that like 50 times lol,35,534444746213461376,+14252837314
Sumlin ,35,534444734908300864,+14252837314
Sumlin? If that was even a possibility ,413,534444731728028800,+15035107079
What would you love? ,413,534444724967753152,+15035107079
I don't love this ,35,534444713552426816,+14252837314
Rumor is he’s already bought a house here too,42,534443702115473536,+15035043582
Because that d is gonna be nasty next year ,413,534443681795128576,+15035107079
His resume looks better if he stays ,413,534443674892801024,+15035107079
Yeah exactly it may be a step back to go try to do year 1 again with a whole new defense,413,534443668817265728,+15035107079
If he gets a HC job it will be KSU ,42,534443348964531392,+15035043582
We won’t know til after the bowl game. I have a feeling he’ll stay it’s not like he owes Willie anything. They were together one year,42,534443302548951616,+15035043582
Know he wanted the HC,120,534443250485381376,+14153064486
Is Leavitt staying?,120,534443247343213824,+14153064486
Let’s hope the players know what they’re talking about. Let’s keep all the assistants but the snakes and we’re golden ,42,534443205377639040,+15035043582

These are all grammatically wrong and hastily typed sentences ,35,534402995055353152,+14252837314

It's a good thing ,35,534402837760749824,+14252837314
I think generally the reason the NBA is beginning to separate itself from NFL from off field issues is because within aau coaches are allowed to give assistance and help to kids in need. ,35,534402834189348672,+14252837314
I just don’t think playing AAU is a sign of being well off ,25,534402760547086208,+15035513466

Is what you mean ,35,534402199112524736,+14252837314
Lol now gelo will never get. Chance at making the league ,35,534402196210087552,+14252837314
We only heard about lavar ball after lonzo tore it up in the Maui invitational or whatever earl season tourney that was ,35,534402170714898112,+14252837314
And now LaMelo can play in China ,25,534402166502045376,+15035513466
And Gelo was never making the league ,25,534402151375883072,+15035513466
Yeah bc lonzo is good ,35,534402141152337536,+14252837314
And I don’t think he ever has ,25,534402135183341056,+15035513466
They traded Russell,25,534402124598055808,+15035513466
He’s on the Lakers,25,534402120859567616,+15035513466
I just don’t think what LaVar is doing hurts his kid,25,534402117908333568,+15035513466
And I feel like you don't either ,35,534402087643487232,+14252837314

Dude do you know anything about the financial/family backgrounds of Jason Tatum or fultz or are you just assuming it was dire or something,35,534402063278914432,+14252837314
Oh my dad? He's a real price of shit,35,534401996549913856,+14252837314

What do you think of you dad?,35,534401981930053952,+14252837314
If you ask each rookie in the draft class,35,534401975246852416,+14252837314
How many nba players get asked questions about their dad in every interview? ,35,534401956274035008,+14252837314
Grant Hill might have been the last,42,534401948574272384,+15035043582
How many nba players you hear of like that?,25,534401932315375552,+15035513466
lol ok but Lonzo has said many times Lavar helped him have a good life ,25,534401922767821312,+15035513466
LONZO IS FINE,35,534401913018871808,+14252837314
Lonzo? ,35,534401904838630208,+14252837314

"I don’t get why you are doing that to him tho, nobody told you to",25,534401893115462272,+15035513466
Not him ,35,534401892307940032,+14252837314
I'm being hard on his asshole father ,35,534401889600293376,+14252837314
Bc of his dipshit dad ,35,534401879038974976,+14252837314
So why are you being so hard on him? Lol,25,534401876875891456,+15035513466
He has to deal with ten extra layers of pressure ,35,534401874247705920,+14252837314
Maybe even good ,35,534401865438904256,+14252837314
Lonzo is fine,35,534401862258649344,+14252837314
No dude I don't ,35,534401859169048320,+14252837314
You act like he’s just wilting ,25,534401843395754368,+15035513466
He’s also not caving ,25,534401836602815168,+15035513466
Bc his dad is an asshole ,35,534401818291974528,+14252837314
He’s a 20 year old rookie,25,534401812804291008,+15035513466
"Yeah he's fine, not necessarily promising but fine, but he has to deal with this scrutiny ",35,534401811407441152,+14252837314
Like FOH,25,534401806203857920,+15035513466
The notion that he’s trash is ridiculous,25,534401800628094464,+15035513466
At the same time,25,534401785159638144,+15035513466
Look at his numbers compared to Jason Kidd,25,534401782626082688,+15035513466
He’s doing ok,25,534401776069106112,+15035513466
Yeah dude ,35,534401774428030464,+14252837314
Maybe he'd have more confidence if his dad wasn't out claiming he was better than Steph curry before he ever stepped in the league ,35,534401762304909248,+14252837314
Gee ,35,534401732628088256,+14252837314

and there is something more valuable in that,25,534401728312549568,+15035513466
Everything you're saying ,35,534401707334308160,+14252837314
I just think confidence is the bigger issue but I also think he really just likes to make the right play,25,534401706606027392,+15035513466
I'm gonna wager ,35,534401698981915008,+14252837314

There is no Vanderbilt ,25,534189073127495552,+15035513466
Emphasized “and all 10 other teams can upset each other at any point”,25,534189066226659520,+15035513466
and all 10 other teams can upset each other at any point,66,534189061235713728,+15039100235
We have 1 1/2 cupcakes,66,534189050131777984,+15039100235
The problem is the bottom half is stout,66,534189040403728704,+15039100235
I heard Willie is scared to compete with Jonathan smith for in state talent but idk,48,534189035332257280,+15035806566
No other conference comes close and I don’t know if Willie is on their level without getting the best recruits ,25,534189030352570752,+15035513466
"Leach, Rich Rod, Chip, Peterson, Shaw ",25,534189003395937664,+15035513466
The pac has a lot of dudes that can game plan,25,534188989906538752,+15035513466
In terms of guys who can beat you any given Saturday,25,534188975239025088,+15035513466
I don’t even think usc is the scariest ,25,534188964118816128,+15035513466
I’m also just not that high on the pac like I think USC isn’t that good ,413,534188952224454144,+15035107079
I think that’s overstating ,413,534188931325422528,+15035107079
Year*,413,534188909616958144,+15035107079
And the pac wasn’t great this yea e,413,534188906987378112,+15035107079
The Pac is a murderers row of game plan dons ,25,534188902747600064,+15035513466
Yeah except for Clemson ,413,534188893808456192,+15035107079
I’m reading Canzano and he’s also right getting to the playoff is way easier in the ACC,25,534188873166698240,+15035513466
Yes ,413,534188839273730496,+15035107079

not a great recruiter ,66,534188643676003200,+15039100235
And FSU needs a great coach,66,534188638985829376,+15039100235
It’s just weird cause Willie is a better recruiter than coach,66,534188634842846848,+15039100235
He sure sold us,48,534188523560241728,+15035806566
Those*,42,534188331588768256,+15035043582
Recruiting to Oregon with all this luxuries is still tough Willie is just a great salesman,42,534188322582555264,+15035043582
Does not set us apart ,35,534188302514263360,+14252837314
Every other school in the country can say that,35,534188298307276480,+14252837314
Not the proposition of moving far away from home,35,534188289968693504,+14252837314
But that's the case you can make for Oregon recruiting ,35,534188278374026304,+14252837314
Yeah true ,35,534188260299207680,+14252837314
"Ya know, the whole reason Jimbo left",413,534188254657084672,+15035107079

"Well in that case, Florida doesn’t have great facilities",413,534188241127528448,+15035107079
And NFL facilities ,35,534188234715595712,+14252837314
We have Nike ,35,534188230145724992,+14252837314
Check out all our shit,35,534188226396620032,+14252837314
Just like UF and Miami do,413,534188224130686976,+15035107079
I think our selling point is,35,534188221695018560,+14252837314
This is all moot because FSU already recruits itself,413,534188212942414528,+15035107079
Yeah I just think that their is a selling point they used that had to do with making your own path and getting out on your own. That HAS to be part of the sell to get a kid to Eugene from Florida ,413,534188192282880576,+15035107079
We just have to sell them on Eugene too ,35,534188162329590080,+14252837314
I truly don’t think the offenses they run matters that much,413,534188148565297152,+15035107079
I doubt our pitch is much different than USC or ucla ,35,534188148433729856,+14252837314
Different conferences ,35,534188118480327616,+14252837314
I mean all say their school is the best,413,534188117210914880,+15035107079
They run different offenses ,35,534188114591781376,+14252837314
"Because all are big programs, big resources ",413,534188110883078336,+15035107079
Why?,35,534188099010873088,+14252837314
Hahah ,35,534188096245719424,+14252837314
But you can bet those guys all have the same pitch,413,534188086601721280,+15035107079
Are far enough apart ,35,534188067842759104,+14252837314
Uf Miami and fsu,35,534188062779708864,+14252837314
Florida is a big state,35,534188052672273856,+14252837314
Yeah I guess we’ll see,413,534188049613832960,+15035107079
It was crazy that he was convincing all the Florida guys. Now his job in that aspect will be much easier,42,534188026800554496,+15035043582
You’ve got the same pitch down there that every other school in your state does,413,534188023330519936,+15035107079
It’s a different way to recruit,413,534188012960814016,+15035107079
Is the issue ,35,534187991647588480,+14252837314
But the point that he has to spin it,35,534187988803544768,+14252837314
That might be how he spins it,35,534187982341249920,+14252837314
It's an obstacle ,35,534187963235560192,+14252837314
It's not a selling point ,35,534187952964707840,+14252837314
I don't see how you can argue that moving away from home is a feather in oregons cap ,35,534187948088059456,+14252837314
Fair ,35,534187918276526464,+14252837314
But ,35,534187916711768640,+14252837314

"Lot more competition down there. Think about recruiting a kid to Eugene it’s a big “make your own mark, move away from home” is part of that pitch. Now willie has the same pitch that every other coach down there does. ",413,534187879501379712,+15035107079

Absolutely is which Idk if that’s the smartest way to hire,413,534187833703582080,+15035107079
Yup,413,534187822052431360,+15035107079
I just think it's the pipeline to Florida recruits ,35,534187818094505792,+14252837314
The records are super similar since 2010 ,413,534187791482822400,+15035107079
Like they think their program is SO much better and its not. ,413,534187781133346560,+15035107079
Yeah FSU also being super shitty about taking Willie too,413,534187770583665344,+15035107079
And their school was just being cheap as fuck. That was purely a money play for jimbo. Willie is making us look like a stepping stone little bitch,48,534187646202378304,+15035806566

I’d rather have Cristobal/Leavitt combo with one as the HC ,413,534129861601120960,+15035107079
Yeah I don’t love Sumlin,413,534129842174903872,+15035107079
Ya that’s probably our best bet unless we can pull sumlin,42,534129817011616000,+15035043582
Cuz Willie I’ve been hearing randy Shannon as his DC,413,534129787990409344,+15035107079
I think if you hire Cristobal as HC you can keep Leavitt,413,534129778748728960,+15035107079

Then go get some hot shot from a big name and pay him out the ass as an OC,120,534129623912467008,+14153064486

No you’re prolly right,66,534105124643663872,+15039100235
And if Willie wants to go back home and that is in his long term goals then this is the time to do it,413,534105124225888000,+15035107079
Plus if we offer more we’re just playing into his agents hand,42,534105123569924608,+15035043582

Yeah I think Willie is young enough if he’s smart he’ll stay and build us back up to 9 wins and then land a job for huge money,66,534105063403020864,+15039100235

But it’s a positive because you’d expect to grow and get better from a 7-5 season ,413,533882887863017536,+15035107079

It’s not like every recruit will leave. FSU has plenty of good recruits as well it’s not like Willie will take every one ,413,533881696174827328,+15035107079
its not a death sentence but it’s another step back,66,533881685036808512,+15039100235
I don’t think it’s a death sentence for Oregon. Some recruits will leave but they’ll still have a good class. ,413,533881671728138944,+15035107079
I wouldn’t care if he left though if there was someone else out there better but there really isn’t,66,533881670396423360,+15039100235

"But hey, he wants to go home I get it. ",413,533881569500931008,+15035107079

Jimbo always recruited too ,413,533881507218275328,+15035107079
Like this is mind blowing to me even with the recruiting ,413,533881497842816832,+15035107079
But he’s a tenacious recruiter ,66,533881490887098816,+15039100235
Yeah true,66,533881480696368448,+15039100235
I’m really surprised to hear he’s their top target ,413,533881475990787968,+15035107079
And FSU can name their guy,413,533881463049896960,+15035107079
Willie was a .500 coach coming in to this job,413,533881431957468480,+15035107079
Lockie and Burmeister are terrible tho ,66,533881424904371520,+15039100235

I just don’t think there was a bad loss besides ASU,66,533881402170433984,+15039100235
okay so maybe a better coach goes 6-0. So my point again. What Coach does better than 8-4?,66,533881390752053760,+15039100235
5-1 with Herb,413,533881343982658880,+15035107079

Besides the ASU game what was a bad outing with Herbert,66,533881139809079872,+15039100235
Welcome the football dark ages to Oregon ,0,533881125024980544,
We were 6-1 with Herbert?,66,533881077484231680,+15039100235
Like what Coach gets our team better than 8-4,66,533881059264319872,+15039100235
Will Scott frost  or whomever becomes the next coach have the same recruiting success ,60,533881057771369920,+15037895186
Yeah,66,533881030381071552,+15039100235
Willie's recruiting class is unreal tho ,60,533881026271484160,+15037895186
Burkmeister*,66,533881024390081856,+15039100235
Like how would chip have done with Burkermeiser,66,533881013526665664,+15039100235
The ASU loss with Herbert was bad I guess but pretty solid improvement,66,533881002364846016,+15039100235
They probably want to keep every five star in the state of Florida ,210,533880976713239680,+15039972480
I mean we flipped our record from helrich and had our two best players on offense hurt for 4 weeks ,66,533880971132508544,+15039100235
He was not amazing and frankly I’m surprised FSU is going after him so hard. They could have their pick of the litter. ,413,533880712412662272,+15035107079
Like guys we shouldn’t have to argue this: Willie was OK in his first year. ,413,533880676729717248,+15035107079
Agree to all of the above Clay ,210,533880653755787840,+15039972480
It’s EXACTLY the same from today’s presser. Some of the local radio guys brought this up tho: this won’t cripple the program and I don’t think this is the best hire FSU could make.,413,533880578368855936,+15035107079
Have you all seen how Willie answered questions at his last two stops when he took new positions?,413,533880534471557632,+15035107079
Yeah,66,533880254065951808,+15039100235
UCLA isn’t necessarily a better job but why not try something new in a talent rich area ,413,533880244791841728,+15035107079
Laughed at “If Taggart leaves we can sign gruden ez”,66,533880221895978240,+15039100235

They might do something cutting edge !,831,533876377391046976,+15038833302
Just because that’s how apps have been monetized in past doesn’t necessarily mean that’s how they’ll choose to do it,831,533876371390698176,+15038833302

They’re burning money for sure but u gotta spend money to make MONEY BABY!!!!!,831,533873987254472512,+15038833302
Yeah but that’s just prizes u gotta factor in production costs and server costs for the 200k people that tune in twice daily ,831,533873969499110208,+15038833302

So right now they’re spending like 600k on advertising a month?,66,533873846022434240,+15039100235
Totally that’s what I thought ,66,533873822584168896,+15039100235
U can’t pitch brands on a user base that doesn’t yet exist ,831,533873809460481664,+15038833302
They’re amassing an audience before they go after brands ,831,533873800803276032,+15038833302
Non invasive ads .... pre roll before u play ... ,831,533873782742060928,+15038833302

I’m curious how they monetize though ,66,533873767206711040,+15039100235
Or burning money for like 1 month then they’ll try and monetize subtlety ,831,533873753107065664,+15038833302

That’s his version of yes ,413,533863298966777344,+15035107079
He said “why wouldn’t I be?” ,413,533863292935806528,+15035107079

I thought Florida was his dream job,48,533848407935589760,+15035806566

Dude what i believe is that it would be absurd for any school with a middling program to pass on a guy with chips resume ,35,531158439709929216,+14252837314

No one laughed at my Vance Joseph gap joke :(,0,531157222257277696,
Can we move on?,413,531157205741844160,+15035107079
This is going down a dark path ,413,531157201115001216,+15035107079
Oh god lol,413,531157187615502592,+15035107079
He relied primarily on his fg kickers ,0,531157182384529856,
I mean most teams who aren’t Bama have to rely on their qb,413,531157169660709376,+15035107079
Lol and he relied primarily on his qbs ,35,531157150044414016,+14252837314
And a coach who couldn’t lead a team ,413,531157148528362048,+15035107079
Year after year we had worse recruits ,413,531157141533954112,+15035107079
That was the biggest issue with Helf ,413,531157131409020160,+15035107079
The players changed ,413,531157123142627456,+15035107079
To Ian’s point. When helbitch took over we “ran the same offense” but you could tell the plays changed enough to be markedly worse ,0,531157114052034368,
Not saying he will but to just ASSUME that he’s going to be a god again is also a big assumption ,413,531157110396823424,+15035107079
Will just come back and suck ,35,531157090046939392,+14252837314
That never missed a bcs game ,35,531157085206439040,+14252837314
Same thing ,413,531157078651760128,+15035107079
But I'm sure the dude ,35,531157077785247808,+14252837314
Arizona ,413,531157076596618624,+15035107079
Arizonan,413,531157074001516800,+15035107079
I doubt we've seen the last of chip ,35,531157070836179968,+14252837314
Ok well ,35,531157063245771904,+14252837314
Willie runs the same damn offense lol,413,531157050445293696,+15035107079
Dude everyone runs spread no huddle ,25,531157048921257472,+15035513466
Sure dude ,35,531157048524824128,+14252837314
He ran a simple passing offense with a heavy rushing attack predicated on the defense being tired ,413,531157038315621376,+15035107079
Uh ,35,531157034364386816,+14252837314
Running the ball was chips scheme and it hasn't been replicated ,35,531157028992579968,+14252837314
I’m curious what the other facets were ,413,531157019952527040,+15035107079
I said TOP,35,531157010815282560,+14252837314
Running the ball? ,413,531157001157762048,+15035107079
Oh really tell me another? ,413,531156998459093568,+15035107079
It's still working ,35,531156996035808576,+14252837314
And guess what ,35,531156992766161920,+14252837314
Time of possession was one facet of chips scheme ,35,531156986551897792,+14252837314
Based entirely on assumptions ,35,531156968286697600,+14252837314
TOP has changed across college football,413,531156965737511616,+15035107079
Literally nothing,35,531156960165363776,+14252837314
To back that up ,35,531156956644754624,+14252837314
Dude you guys have absolutely nothing ,35,531156953556198336,+14252837314
Chip changed the game ,413,531156951423996224,+15035107079
Ya bring up our best player ever,42,531156946704628736,+15035043582
Exactly ,413,531156946500597952,+15035107079
Yes,413,531156944911038400,+15035107079
Everything we did was exploiting a market inefficiency.  Now it’s the norm. Chip is D’Antoni.,25,531156938146559232,+15035513466
Mariota would be on his ass begging for mercy ,35,531156916721209536,+14252837314
Would be really struggling right now ,35,531156902830054272,+14252837314
Usually a couple teams are around there most years ,413,531156898284943808,+15035107079
Those Oregon teams ,35,531156889405390272,+14252837314
Yeah and that’s normally the case ,413,531156889128660224,+15035107079
You're right tho guys,35,531156885134940608,+14252837314
Lol we had two top 10 teams in PAC every year during chips reign ,35,531156855189857216,+14252837314
Different names at the top sometimes but overall,413,531156743111043904,+15035107079
In terms of top to bottom ,413,531156732459946368,+15035107079
PAC 12 has been pretty much the same the last 7-10 years tbh ,413,531156728229309056,+15035107079
Trash takes ,35,531156673460062720,+14252837314
These are putrid,35,531156669980027904,+14252837314
How is the PAC 12 doing now in bowl games?,35,531156650108296640,+14252837314
Yeah and how'd those teams do in bowl games?,35,531156639865023360,+14252837314
I’m not here to dog Chip I’m just saying he’s not necessarily an automatic turnaround for a program ,413,531156631756308544,+15035107079
We played a 6-6 ucla in the inaugural pac12 ship,42,531156630627812608,+15035043582
Those were talented teams ,25,531156614875720256,+15035513466
The winner of a he Stanford Oregon game won the conference pretty much every yr,42,531156608506097344,+15035043582
Today’s isn’t as top heavy,413,531156605600756864,+15035107079
Barkley and those guys ,25,531156603175729536,+15035513466
This pac 12 top to bottom is stronger but not as top heavy ,413,531156600465425728,+15035107079
They were still good ,25,531156595458325888,+15035513466
That shit is still happening with usc it’s a joke ,413,531156581684333056,+15035107079
You’re using the “USC” name ,413,531156572400146752,+15035107079
You're high dude that PAC 12 is way stronger than this one ,35,531156569472942336,+14252837314
USC was not that good ,413,531156565030525184,+15035107079
They still had good teams ,35,531156554504633216,+14252837314
USC was still on sanctions,42,531156546012624768,+15035043582
USC was good too ,35,531156545046307328,+14252837314
PAC 12 murdered in bowl games ,35,531156539975159872,+14252837314
Stanford was good that was about it,42,531156535470577472,+15035043582
You're high ,35,531156531935864000,+14252837314
No it wasn't! ,35,531156528665763136,+14252837314
Pac10 was garbage when he was here,42,531156516727313984,+15035043582
Has,35,531156508141036736,+14252837314
What had taggart done? ,35,531156497152948160,+14252837314
I think it's ridiculous to assume he's fallen off ,35,531156491957250624,+14252837314
I know that ,413,531156482191339968,+15035107079
Until I see otherwise ,35,531156482006463552,+14252837314
In his career ,35,531156472187546752,+14252837314
Lol chip has never not gone to a bcs game ,35,531156468065714368,+14252837314
He HATES that stuff. So he’s going to need to find a staff that can do all of that for him ,413,531156456950447104,+15035107079
Deal with boosters ,413,531156436753154752,+15035107079
"He’s been out for a while and at Oregon he had an entire staff in place to recruit, manage players, etc. ",413,531156433289299968,+15035107079
I just don’t necessarily think Chip is the automatic difference maker that we remember ,413,531156413498158912,+15035107079
Yeah I gotcha ,413,531156366498017792,+15035107079
"Fair, just saying in general but ya",42,531156361018053760,+15035043582
Disliked “I honk you guys are gonna cry when Florida is contending for titles and we're fighting to secure the holiday bowl ”,0,531156344778534656,
I think USC and possibly UCLA does,413,531156342602817280,+15035107079
They are over performing this year ,413,531156332492379648,+15035107079
I don’t think the ASU job opens up,413,531156322755084992,+15035107079
I honk you guys are gonna cry when Florida is contending for titles and we're fighting to secure the holiday bowl ,35,531156315164993280,+14252837314
Also guys let’s not forget if the USC job opens up we don’t fucking want to play chip again,413,531156314417444928,+15035107079
If he goes to like ASU I’d lose my shit,42,531156304577578304,+15035043582
I think it’d be fun ,413,531156300298417088,+15035107079
Me too Rengel,413,531156292600233792,+15035107079
Ya I’d rather see chip in SEC,42,531156283267550016,+15035043582
I mean I dunno if it would be a disaster ,35,531156282648894528,+14252837314
Is unique ,35,531156268511049728,+14252837314
But the running spread ,35,531156265568506496,+14252837314
I also think Florida makes sense for Chip ,413,531156261627467136,+15035107079
Yah I love chip but it would be a disaster to not ride it out w taggert ,0,531156259712717504,
Yeah ,35,531156259096106048,+14252837314
I don't think that's necessarily true ,35,531156251875578432,+14252837314
The uptempo offense is ran a lot of places now ,413,531156250795135488,+15035107079
If he comes back it’s probably not at Oregon,42,531156249643616896,+15035043582
What makes you say that?,35,531156227740843520,+14252837314

I think with La they’ll have 78M in salary ,25,529884359676378752,+15035513466
Gay and Green have player options ,25,529884322315075136,+15035513466
Ok maybe not so impossible ,25,529884306587862976,+15035513466

Lemme check the cap shit first tho ,25,529884240259675520,+15035513466
I think the LA extension plus the Pau Gasol contract makes that almost impossible ,25,529884230783251072,+15035513466

There’s no excuse for Terrence Jones not being able to play. But LA completely exposed his D,48,529884198406005632,+15035806566
Yeah you’re right ,25,529884196164843072,+15035513466
I would say 50% LA’s doing and 50% the game just moved away from players like Asik being effective. He can’t hit the backboard from 10 feet out,48,529884181035156480,+15035806566
I need boogie and pop together,210,529884157978091264,+15039972480
You guys what is it going to take to get Boogie to SAS?,210,529884153166623104,+15039972480

And maybe Asik’s too?,25,529884129516449216,+15035513466
But I also think he’s like 80% of that player today,48,529884127003905280,+15035806566

"This morning the Wifi Alliance (the group that standardizes how your devices connect to Wifi) announced that a security vulnerability has been discovered in all Wifi routers and client devices (ie your cell phone or laptop). 

Venders are currently working to release patches for many routers and devices, however, depending on your device and home router, there may be a long wait to receive them, or they may need to be manually installed. Only one of the two devices needs to have the patch for the system to be protected (ie either the cell phone/laptop or the wifi router).

If an unprotected client connects to an unprotected wifi network, information from those devices can be intercepted. 

For those of you who use Windows, Microsoft has already issued a software update to close the issue for Windows 8 and 10. Please run a software update as soon as possible and install the necessary updates. If you are running an older version of Windows you will not receive updates.

Google is expected to release the patch to hardware vendors in early November, however, due to the time it often takes Android hardware venders to get updates to cell phones (if they do at all), it may be many months before your Android handset is protected. 

While Apple has yet to make a public statement on the vulnerability and MacOS/iOS, those running iOS 11 are only vulnerable to a small subset of this issue due to the way iOS handles wifi connections, making it more difficult for information to be intercepted. I'll update with more info when available.

If you have Wifi at your house, it is important for you to check and update the firmware on your personal wifi router as soon as possible. Venders such as Linksys/Cisco, and Netgear, and others have already released firmware updates for their routers and you can find instructions on how to update at their respective websites.

If you use an ISP's wifi router (such as Sprectum/TimeWarner or AT&T), please reach out to your ISP for information on updating your system",831,529869406721442432,+15038833302

Emphasized “A team literally did just that.”,48,528765887243078016,+15035806566
A team literally did just that.,25,528765882514247424,+15035513466
Because teams just don’t sign qb’s  off the street mid year. ,413,528765874047484416,+15035107079
But the story evolved today.,25,528765872987611520,+15035513466
I mean Gunz I feel like we did by saying he should’ve been a backup at the beginning of the season,413,528765852402078144,+15035107079
It wasn’t like I just got on my lefty horse and wanted to talk Kap today,25,528765841005583040,+15035513466
To me the story has been over and it’s fucking awful and that’s the nfl. I have zero respect for that league and the owners. This goes even farther back to the non guaranteed contracts which is literally one of the most disgusting issues in sports ,413,528765830573425280,+15035107079
When teams are bringing in Brandon Weeden to play we can talk about it. ,25,528765829136144384,+15035513466
We knew Kap should have started. At this point we can’t expect a team to bring him in mid year can we? That rarely happens. ,413,528765788601127168,+15035107079
How so? ,413,528765766242751104,+15035107079
Because it’s gotten more absurd. The story has not been in stasis. ,25,528765738832101120,+15035513466
"Maybe that’s why its a bit different for me. I know all the issues, we all know in this group how messed up it is. It’s almost like we get baffled every week when it happens and I just don’t get it. ",413,528765689513208640,+15035107079
Of course we talk about it a lot ,25,528765685207664704,+15035513466
Its one of the biggest stories in the biggest sport in the country!,25,528765675762032256,+15035513466
And I can understand that fact without having to bring it up over and over. And maybe you guys haven’t seen it but I’ve seen my dear friend Erik do this 6 times in the last 3 months and we’ve gone down this rabbit hole. ,413,528765650733797312,+15035107079

I’m not reducing anything Kap is saying. The system is fucked up and wrongfully ostracizing Kap for speaking out on real issues. I don’t need to rehash how shitty the nfl is every week because I know that already and knew it before this whole thing happened. ,413,528765612413793344,+15035107079
"And how is watching games, which in turn support the owners, somehow worse or equal to silencing Kaps message about injustices and reducing it to pettiness ",48,528765433682945280,+15035806566
"But you’re rationalizing the shitty behavior of the owners, which is not only shitty, but it’s detrimental to the supposed goal of winning football games. ",25,528765369562844544,+15035513466

And I bet Kap feels the same way to an extent ,413,528765141611450432,+15035107079
I guess that’s my biggest thing. Hearing someone continually complain about a rich athlete not getting a job is petty to me in comparison to real injustices happening around the world. It’s just annoying. ,413,528765124957361216,+15035107079

Nobody goes on the record ,25,528759652786519040,+15035513466
That’s what reporting is you dunce ,25,528759645998366144,+15035513466
Theres some “sources” saying he would’ve taken it ,413,528759634903762112,+15035107079
Gunz I’ve read all the stories there’s no facts there,413,528759622151988992,+15035107079
He just wanted A JOB in the league ,25,528759613721678464,+15035513466
Clay he wanted to take the backup job ,25,528759601361699584,+15035513466
The jags are the only team being ridiculous ,66,528759593203965632,+15039100235
So he’s not good but has a positive WAR? Where we going with this Clayton Travis,120,528759588575270144,+14153064486
I truly don’t think he wanted to take the Hawks backup job ,413,528759588140455744,+15035107079
Yeah look at the teams. The jags totally should’ve got him,413,528759579030192128,+15035107079
Everyone else is either like pseudo tanking or has a young guy already,66,528759567162584512,+15039100235
He isn’t a good passer of the football ,413,528759564400907968,+15035107079
Gunz it’s not mental for Kap it’s physical ,413,528759557398948672,+15035107079
Questioned “And Kap STILL could absolutely help some teams win”,120,528759553781244544,+14153064486
I mean there’s plenty of guys who could run a college offense and not a pro offense ,413,528759547967268928,+15035107079
the only team that legit could use him is the jags,66,528759543735740672,+15039100235
Questioned “Kap couldn’t run shanahan’s system in SF ”,120,528759538459134848,+14153064486

Kap couldn’t run shanahan’s system in SF ,413,528759492761385216,+15035107079
or Cam newton ,66,528759489598741312,+15039100235
Ok so 10 teams lol,25,528759487969686272,+15035513466
and so is even Russell Wilson,66,528759485870721344,+15039100235
Well Aaron Rodgers is allowed to kneel ,66,528759480144834304,+15039100235
That’s two teams where the situation wouldn’t allow ,413,528759477908169280,+15035107079

He’s objectively better than a third of the starting QBs in the NFL.,210,528759421224088640,+15039972480

Gunz that means he wasn’t good,413,528759403592524544,+15035107079
Dude he was a top 20 QB last year ,25,528759392920435456,+15035513466
Teams are actively not putting the best possible team out there,25,528759386482197312,+15035513466
Kaepernick also isn’t good,66,528759382648910528,+15039100235
I think it’s kind of like Michael sam,66,528759378465627904,+15039100235
I mean it’s also a football issue ,25,528759374076828736,+15035513466
And I also know what I’m supporting and don’t have to bring up the obvious problem with the Kap situation ,413,528759372959099264,+15035107079
Note: Clayton supports White supremacy ,120,528759352372464192,+14153064486
Oh I totally do,413,528759339433408512,+15035107079
Note: Clayton definitely does not watch he NFL,120,528759331559505472,+14153064486
If kaep wouldn’t have gone all Nat Turner and started an uprising he’d be on the jags right now ,66,528759320221935040,+15039100235

Guys the nfl sucks. They should guarantee contracts too so guys aren’t killing them selves only to be cut later. ,413,528759280808716032,+15035107079
But I’m a republican now so don’t listen to me,66,528759280546419840,+15039100235
"I think he’s not getting signed because he’s a Christian like Tebow, but that’s just my honest opinion ",120,528759276726538880,+14153064486
Clay is right ,66,528759269628436800,+15039100235
I’m just tired of acting like it’s so crazy. ,413,528759239062119488,+15035107079
And it’s shitty and nfl owners are the worst people ever for the most part. But that’s the business. ,413,528759224415894720,+15035107079
It’s not about that he was the mark of the kneel. And nfl owners suck but the fact of the matter is Kap isn’t good enough to be signed and bring the “face of injustice” to the team. ,413,528759210801874176,+15035107079
I mean it’s just kinda of tiresome we keep doing this. ,413,528759169280845376,+15035107079
Kap even said he’s not gonna kneel lol,25,528759168350914496,+15035513466
I don’t think it’s dumb.,210,528759167113565952,+15039972480
Like we know. No rich white owner wants the media that comes wth Kap. ,413,528759150801976704,+15035107079
I mean just cause still bullshit doesn’t mean we can’t smell it ,25,528759149910604032,+15035513466
It’s not like we gotta rehash every qb who has to play ,413,528759132456366272,+15035107079
Go on...,120,528759131818619712,+14153064486
We know why he isn’t signed ,413,528759123124267584,+15035107079

But it’s definitely a move in the right direction. Playing for charity is cool too and will probably result in a more competitive game,48,528751369491552128,+15035806566
Still gonna have a guy like Batum in there instead of Blake or Dame which is wack af,48,528751323170693888,+15035806566

"The west is so stacked people like Blake, Dame and Klay will still miss ",48,528751061152113216,+15035806566

What do you mean?,25,528751003368143808,+15035513466

Which I think is easier for the league to stomach than another Philly,25,528318858835307136,+15035513466
As in just being the suns ?,831,528318855762807360,+15038833302
But may encourage subtle tanking ,25,528318837978552128,+15035513466
I think it will de-incentivize the super tank ,25,528318827285960896,+15035513466
Brooklyn will suck but they probably won't be the worst in the league ,25,528318619875344960,+15035513466

Whereas previously worst they could get is 4,25,528318221814169856,+15035513466
Why is everyone underplaying the addition of Jay Crowder to the Cavs. That’s going to take so much pressure off of Lebron in the playoffs ,120,528318216878266112,+14153064486
And if you have the worst record you could potentially get the 5th pick ,25,528318211216094272,+15035513466
And all three of the worst records will have an equal 14% shot ,25,528318193280675904,+15035513466
Tyvm,831,528318179473793984,+15038833302
The worst team now only has a 14 percent chance of getting the No. 1 pick instead of 25 percent ,25,528318166773618432,+15035513466

Hopkins is the best WR on that list and it’s not even close ,120,527970154067595456,+14153064486

Like football outsiders was all about how cooks is like the first great outside threat Brady has had since Moss ,25,527969158818666240,+15035513466
Cooks is good for sure just RZ liability ,66,527969156336600512,+15039100235

He doesn't run routes like AB,66,527969011325608960,+15039100235

They get a free trial run and expiring deal,48,527730898067977408,+15035806566
Trade them because you have to give something to get something ,25,527730887750419648,+15035513466
Does New York really wanna pay Vonleh!,25,527730875277055040,+15035513466
Why trade them,48,527730874466107136,+15035806566
Exactly my point,48,527730871818033472,+15035806566
I guess a pick would work ,25,527730868031483904,+15035513466
Why? There some of our best assets ,25,527730861972893504,+15035513466
"Moe, Meyers, vonleh and a pick seems fair",48,527730860669739264,+15035806566
I seriously doubt we trade Collins or Swanigan either,48,527730833946381568,+15035806566
Don’t worry,48,527730745130641728,+15035806566
Haha dude we’re not trading CJ ,48,527730742800032640,+15035806566
"And on a cheap rookie deal, the kind of which New York doesn't really have ",25,527730550609201216,+15035513466
True,105,527730516642813696,+19714099773
Collins was a top 10 pick ,25,527730470318836480,+15035513466
"Moe, Meyers, Collins ",25,527730417948333056,+15035513466
I don't want to lose CJ but who else we got to make that trade?,105,527730361104879168,+19714099773
Let's discuss. ,105,527730302206013888,+19714099773
Wait what? No CJ???,120,527730262258577088,+14153064486
Can we consider Cj as good as gone if this happens?,105,527730187988764992,+19714099773
My question is who we trading for him besides harkless?,105,527730173605346944,+19714099773
Emphasized “Sorry I’m just in a really pessimistic place as a blazer fan haha ”,105,527730047905244096,+19714099773
There are multiple ways for them to do it dude ,25,527729878473413248,+15035513466
Cowherd had the only plausible way for the Knicks to fuck him. Play him 5 minutes then bench him every single game. His career averages will plummet and every player values those,48,527729859332204800,+15035806566
You take the game away from him ,25,527729859155350912,+15035513466
Not sit on the bench ,25,527729850244102976,+15035513466
You wanna show what you got ,25,527729846515697024,+15035513466
"I dunno man, you train like he has all summer ",25,527729841779016704,+15035513466
I still think he’d ride out on the bench for a few months and test the Knicks patience ,48,527729824223988800,+15035806566
Not with his contract number ,25,527729784241409792,+15035513466
And they're not buying him out either ,25,527729779254619584,+15035513466
That’d be an interesting game of chicken for sure,48,527729759916962624,+15035806566
When his basketball years are dwindling ,25,527729757527514240,+15035513466
In the final years of his prime?,25,527729738924148800,+15035513466
He'll do that for the whole season? ,25,527729731232669376,+15035513466
Then he collects his check and saves his legs,48,527729717905112960,+15035806566
Because they won't trade him where he wants to go ,25,527729715352560768,+15035513466
The Knicks ,25,527729707355539776,+15035513466
What happens if they just say don't show up ,25,527729703372476608,+15035513466
Who else Gundy??,48,527729698015042752,+15035806566
Melo is the only one with leverage,48,527729690387298368,+15035806566
Right but what happens if they start making him inactive?,25,527729688014198528,+15035513466
His head might be out of NY but it’s still in that comfy ass hoodie ,210,527729665964176640,+15039972480
Melo isnt the only one with leverage here ,25,527729656439648128,+15035513466
"I don’t think he really gives a shit haha. He’s been pretty Melo during all the dysfunction, if ya know what I’m sayin ",48,527729651882060288,+15035806566

I’d say less than halfway ,210,527729601863095040,+15039972480
Can’t we get some Jordan brand reps on the phone with him? Throw him some extra dough for coming to Portland ,48,527729598869012864,+15035806566
Right but does Melo want to go through the same shit again?,25,527729598285971648,+15035513466
But Melo is in control at the end of the day. So we’re only half way there with having a package the knicks want,48,527729579089076032,+15035806566
That there is smoke right now is good ,25,527729534879015424,+15035513466
And they aren't going to give Melo what he wants ,25,527729459937396288,+15035513466
It means Portland has what NY wants ,25,527729447083745024,+15035513466
If he says Portland has the most attractive package ,25,527729436927674304,+15035513466

Exactly ,35,526620295000000000,+14252837314

I mean if either makes it clear ,35,526620276000000000,+14252837314
Yeah I guess he does have a firm stance with the Westbrook scenario. If he doesn't sign the extension you know he's leaving and you trade him ,48,526620274000000000,+15035806566

Only reason he didn’t with KD was cause they had a real title contender ,25,526620225000000000,+15035513466
He might trade Westbrook if he doesn’t agree to an extension,25,526620196000000000,+15035513466

True,25,526619394000000000,+15035513466

Who else could CLE get that would actually help them vs. GSW?,25,526619285000000000,+15035513466
Nah they can't trade him yet,0,526619258000000000,
Would he really wanna pay two max guys?,25,526619240000000000,+15035513466
And Tom benson is notoriously cheap,25,526619232000000000,+15035513466
Player option,25,526619218000000000,+15035513466
He can become an FA in 2020,25,526619213000000000,+15035513466
Cause they might just lose him and he’s only been on one team?,25,526619210000000000,+15035513466
He's got like 4 years left on his deal,48,526619186000000000,+15035806566
Why would New Orleans trade AD when he's locked in?,48,526619177000000000,+15035806566
Like if New Orleans believes in Porter or Bagley or Doncic and they give Cousins all the money to stay in the South...,25,526619160000000000,+15035513466
Davis could also guard KD,25,526619120000000000,+15035513466
Emphasized “Him and isiah ”,25,526619061000000000,+15035513466
Davis will also be subservient to LeBron,25,526619040000000000,+15035513466

Yes but I’m just saying I would ask for Davis first,25,526619004000000000,+15035513466
Boogie on an expiring is more likely IMO,48,526618974000000000,+15035806566
2 years left,25,526618959000000000,+15035513466
Davis is locked in for years tho,48,526618959000000000,+15035806566
He's one of the 3 most valuable. Assets in the league ,35,526618951000000000,+14252837314
It's better than what Boston has ,25,526618948000000000,+15035513466
Could be in play ,25,526618942000000000,+15035513466
Lol no way they get Davis ,35,526618939000000000,+14252837314
If the Nets suck early ,25,526618935000000000,+15035513466
Anthony Davis would be more 🔥🔥🔥,25,526618914000000000,+15035513466

Tatum will be a 20ppg guy eventually ,48,525139271000000000,+15035806566
Defense yeah,66,525139268000000000,+15039100235
Jimmy > Hayward for me,25,525139243000000000,+15035513466
Emphasized “Small point guards fall off a cliff at 31-32. Chris Paul is the exception ”,66,525139233000000000,+15039100235
Oh yeah Tatum is raw,48,525139231000000000,+15035806566
And you could keep all that other defensive talent but still have a very good point guard ,25,525139228000000000,+15035513466
He still could be a great scorer,66,525139226000000000,+15039100235
I think Tatum won't be that much worse than fultz,66,525139220000000000,+15039100235

It's about the best players not the most good players ,66,525139196000000000,+15039100235
Yeah 5 year plan kyrie is head and shoulders above IT,48,525139193000000000,+15035806566
I guess where I’m at is I think Fultz is sick ,25,525139190000000000,+15035513466
I'm taking Hayward and kyrie,66,525139183000000000,+15039100235

Kyrie is only gonna get better. IT is already 29 this is his prime like it doesn't get better,66,525139109000000000,+15039100235
They would trade Crowder obviously in either scenario ,25,525139104000000000,+15035513466
You’d probably rather have the former right? ,25,525139103000000000,+15035513466

I can't tell if you guys think kyrie is overrated or you personally overrate IT,66,525139087000000000,+15039100235
Yeah danny outsmarted himself ,48,525139071000000000,+15035806566
But if they keep Bradley,25,525139053000000000,+15035513466
I don't think they got any better tbh,35,525139040000000000,+14252837314
Tatum is good tho ,66,525139039000000000,+15039100235
It's close,66,525139031000000000,+15039100235
Yeah I'd rather have kyrie and Hayward over those 3,66,525139024000000000,+15039100235
"So it's Fultz, IT Jimmy OR Kyrie, Hayward, Tatum. Right?",48,525139018000000000,+15035806566
"But Fultz, IT and Jimmy would mean no Hayward",48,525138978000000000,+15035806566
And now he’s paying 20M to a point guard when he could have had Fultz on a rookie deal ,25,525138949000000000,+15035513466
Ainge is losing his mojo tho. You're telling me rookie ass koby Altman wouldn't take the lakers pick next year instead of the Brooklyn pick??,48,525138931000000000,+15035806566
"Yeah but, they could have just drafted Fultz and traded the pick for Jimmy Butler and kept Isaiah ",25,525138924000000000,+15035513466

But they had to start trading those picks sooner or later ,66,525138892000000000,+15039100235
I thought Cleveland shoulda send Boston a pick tbh haha,48,525138883000000000,+15035806566
But like the celtics don't need that pick. I mean I guess they do. ,66,525138880000000000,+15039100235
The real loser here is Portland because a trade happened and we didn’t find a way to throw Meyers into it.,210,525138880000000000,+15039972480
Cleveland wins the trade because of the pick I agree,25,525138862000000000,+15035513466
Tru,66,525138855000000000,+15039100235
So I say Cleveland won,48,525138849000000000,+15035806566
Even trade = a win for Cleveland IMO tho. Cleveland is supposed to lose that trade cuz Kyrie killed their leverage ,48,525138842000000000,+15035806566
Ainge actually looks better now for fucking up the Paul George thing,66,525138828000000000,+15039100235
but Cleveland has a major LeBron out that they didn’t have otherwise,25,525138828000000000,+15035513466
Kyrie doesn’t try on defense until the Finals so it’s even ,25,525138814000000000,+15035513466
It's an even trade IMO,66,525138808000000000,+15039100235
IT is a revolving door on D but the dude averaged 30 points a game,48,525138801000000000,+15035806566
Oh I agree. Especially long term. But it's not a far drop off this season at all,48,525138782000000000,+15035806566
like I love IT but idk ,66,525138763000000000,+15039100235
Lebron is still the best but kyrie is way better than IT,66,525138756000000000,+15039100235
The ceiling is higher for Boston and the floor is lower now,25,525138751000000000,+15035513466
Without Bradley and crowder too now ,35,525138740000000000,+14252837314
LeBron still best player in the east tho,831,525138732000000000,+15038833302
Jeez,35,525138732000000000,+14252837314
I mean Phoenix wouldn't even give up Josh Jackson and Bledsoe and they got a top 7 PG plus Crowder and a player that could be better than josh jackson next year,48,525138729000000000,+15035806566
Boston is immediately better or should be favored,66,525138710000000000,+15039100235
￼,831,525138703000000000,+15038833302
Ehhh they're gonna be worse tho ,66,525138694000000000,+15039100235
"Emphasized “Have we gotten any word on the trade from IT's reps, the lollipop guild ?”",120,525138682000000000,+14153064486

"But given the cards Cleveland was dealt, they made out like bandits",48,525138679000000000,+15035806566
if LeBron leaves,25,525138678000000000,+15035513466
Cavs can get Michael Porter Jr. ,25,525138675000000000,+15035513466
That's a fair trade,66,525138671000000000,+15039100235
That shocks me ,35,525138666000000000,+14252837314
