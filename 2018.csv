Maybe. Late first rounders are actually more valuable so are 2nds ,951,561929917380744448,dylanbranch9@icloud.com
Wouldn’t it have been better to trade Mack once the draft order was set tho? 2 firsts sounds good in a vacuum but if they’re both in the 20’s then that drastically changes things ,48,561929853749187456,+15035806566

IMO ,25,559278616820186112,+15035513466
I’m personally excited for the season because the lakers being good always makes being a blazers fan better,25,559278613791651712,+15035513466

Bc we haven’t seems Leonard in ages ,35,559277806173721344,+14252837314

Yeah I wanna see them play,25,559277779318072576,+15035513466

Demar disappeared ,25,559277743264278912,+15035513466
I think Kawhi is great and Lowry played decent ,25,559277733989924416,+15035513466
And then went completely flat ,35,559277712362304000,+14252837314
Like they dominated last year ,35,559277703492771840,+14252837314

Yeah something like CJ and Nurk for Dieng and Butler but they can’t trade Nurk until December,25,559266219092192192,+15035513466
It would basically take cj and Nurk right? ,35,559266177215085248,+14252837314

I mean maybe ,35,557874057021190912,+14252837314
Nike has way more reach than he does,210,557874030924687360,+15039972480
But he’s (and forgive me for the corporate speak there’s no better way to say it) leveraging the power of the brand to amplify his message,210,557874023804169152,+15039972480

It’s just that the Cavs fucking sucked and harden got robbed the year prior ,48,555376760087257152,+15035806566
Honestly I think Brons 28/9/9 was better than Hardens 30/9/5 last year,48,555376745125463488,+15035806566
He probably will have the best line but it’s worth wondering how much that matters to the overall story,25,555376680789588480,+15035513466
I just like the Lebron narrative. They’re gonna reward him for his consistency too if he plays like last year,48,555376647531188224,+15035806566

Westbrook for the first triple double since Oscar. Then harden to make up for being robbed and balling out again,48,555376523093490112,+15035806566
It also happened with Steph,25,555376521149909504,+15035513466
His crazy output actually translated to wins ,35,555376506098601088,+14252837314
I’m just saying both him and Westbrook had win,48,555376502856241920,+15035806566
If it happened to LeBron it can happen to Harden,25,555376499584232832,+15035513466
Yeah I don't think you can compare him to wesbrook bc of how good the rockets were ,35,555376482251723776,+14252837314
Harden will post the gaudiest stats ,35,555376440611449984,+14252837314
Him and Westbrook has told to win for their crazy stat totals. Now it’s back to the old rules,48,555376430534624320,+15035806566
Of all the teams that are contenders ,35,555376424588729152,+14252837314

Voter fatigue ,25,555376353426887296,+15035513466
I just don’t think he’ll be first purely based on that ,25,555376347406688704,+15035513466
If he puts up bonkers stats and the rockets are the second best team ,35,555376342813487744,+14252837314
Because he was 2nd a bunch of times ,25,555376325613888512,+15035513466

They did?,25,554760834463122624,+15035513466
Like the raptors did ,35,554760834310472704,+14252837314
If the east is so bad why didn't the blazers crush it against the east!? ,35,554760826571699392,+14252837314
On paper they’re really not much different though,951,554760823646820096,dylanbranch9@icloud.com
and they have an absurd fan base,951,554760814296352832,dylanbranch9@icloud.com
And had this incredible historic season making them better than the 2000 blazers,42,554760814137087808,+15035043582
It’s a whole teams country,951,554760809248655552,dylanbranch9@icloud.com
and Toronto is huge ,951,554760804534065984,dylanbranch9@icloud.com
the raptors get media coverage cause of drake,951,554760800831593984,dylanbranch9@icloud.com
But they have a better winning percentage against both conferences! ,35,554760798275712512,+14252837314
Yeah man! ,35,554760782233462784,+14252837314
This argument was that CJ and Demar are pretty neck and neck and then your argument for Demar was that the raptors are gods gift to earth ,951,554760774841291200,dylanbranch9@icloud.com
63 and 59,25,554760770376245760,+15035513466
Like how their winning percentage against the same teams is a difference of 4 percentage points ,25,554760762945280320,+15035513466
But we brought other facts to the table and you just think they don’t count? ,25,554760743662188032,+15035513466
I thought I was arguing with brock and Gundy ,35,554760741197250816,+14252837314
Am I arguing with Chad? ,35,554760725587090496,+14252837314
My point is that that point is easily disprovable bullshit ,35,554760719272129792,+14252837314
That’s all Chad was saying,951,554760708939424512,dylanbranch9@icloud.com
and Kawhi for CJ might even work better for the spurs ,951,554760704643425920,dylanbranch9@icloud.com
They basically the blazers of the east,951,554760691510063168,dylanbranch9@icloud.com
The point is that demand and the raptors aren’t better,951,554760684609257728,dylanbranch9@icloud.com
Then count it! ,35,554760672201017856,+14252837314
That’s a disservice ,831,554760669736982080,+15038833302
Well u can’t just discount conference that easily ,831,554760664462156544,+15038833302
Where Toronto outperformed Portland significantly ,35,554760663587522496,+14252837314
And look at the raw numbers!,35,554760650569616768,+14252837314
So then throw out the conference debate ,35,554760644178863296,+14252837314
Sure! ,35,554760636894921088,+14252837314
They have a shorter flights to a lot of western conference teams than Portland does ,25,554760614881679552,+15035513466
West teams also try less hard against raptors cuz won’t count against this conference / divisional record ,831,554760605596596480,+15038833302
Cause they’re basically in the Midwest ,25,554760568191272704,+15035513466
And Toronto covers less miles ,25,554760560286996352,+15035513466
Yeah but come on there's a full ten game discrepancy in w/l and point differential is not even close ,35,554760556137808064,+14252837314
The stats for both are quite similar!,25,554760552707589632,+15035513466
Or road trips are taxing ,35,554760528755565632,+14252837314
Space can’t argue that ,831,554760526706292160,+15038833302
So either the east isn't that bad ,35,554760521299670464,+14252837314
Exactly ,831,554760521261125568,+15038833302
The point is they were very similar teams!,25,554760511583374720,+15035513466
Yeah man but they have a better record against the west than the east ,35,554760508662981248,+14252837314
Lol now cross country road trips are beneficial ,35,554760482482603520,+14252837314
Familiarity is key ,831,554760479084636672,+15038833302
So blazers played way more west games and still has very similar winning % ,25,554760473673395904,+15035513466
Toronto could catch them off guard ,831,554760449084864832,+15038833302
Yeah cuz west teams played blazers a lot so better scouting ,831,554760441665397184,+15038833302
Blazers winning % vs the West was .59 and Toronto was 63% in 22 fewer games ,25,554760435791254272,+15035513466
But nothing backs that up ,35,554760434594055424,+14252837314
Bc they had to play in the west ,35,554760427371581824,+14252837314
No lol but you're saying the only reason Toronto was better than Portland ,35,554760414046932224,+14252837314
To say better is a reach ,831,554760413179321792,+15038833302
Obviously the west is better as a whole but it’s one game lol ,48,554760404118625152,+15035806566
That’s your point,48,554760385071161280,+15035806566
One game?!,48,554760381463333376,+15035806566
"""Lol the raptors played better against the west than the blazers played against the east""",35,554760365128478784,+14252837314
Oh yeah?,35,554760347459531328,+14252837314
Not as wide of a discrepancy as space made it seem ,831,554760337035806400,+15038833302
And the west is better than the east and traveling is hard ,35,554760334151010496,+14252837314
Yes Chad that is correct ,35,554760315947984192,+14252837314
So even raptors fans could see that pre Kawhi trade,25,554760302988166784,+15035513466
Raptors were 19-11 against the west. Blazers were 18-12 against the east,48,554760292301531584,+15035806566
Sorry sir ,831,554760291844221376,+15038833302
Me and the Locked on Raptors had a podcast for that very reason ,25,554760290176695808,+15035513466
Differences are there but essentially they have all stars and don’t compete ,0,554760286588234176,
lol alright man ,35,554760281079465408,+14252837314
Blazers raps are basically versions of each other in diff conferences,0,554760265966438080,
Don't call me mam it makes me feel old ,35,554760258785032512,+14252837314
Just the facts mam,831,554760242704135168,+15038833302
Sure whatever fits lol,35,554760231646966208,+14252837314
So chalk that up to youth ,831,554760216885639168,+15038833302
Sixers didn’t have playoff experience tho ,831,554760213480353344,+15038833302
And they got an away game on them ,35,554760190020029760,+14252837314
The sixers are a better team than the blazers coming off a historic win streak ,35,554760180966128320,+14252837314
Ya cuz ur a homer ,831,554760164578034880,+15038833302
But I'm not here campaigning for the heat ,35,554760151382449856,+14252837314
I actually doubt that ,35,554760141034653632,+14252837314
By wider point differential ,831,554760132120622400,+15038833302
Come on dude they got swept ,35,554760127958004928,+14252837314
Would have swept heat easily ,831,554760126916527488,+15038833302
Pelicans were a matchup nightmare ,831,554760114822372928,+15038833302
Pretty sure the would have been bounced in the east too lol,35,554760103977222912,+14252837314
And they got swept by the pelicans ,35,554760089859827968,+14252837314
I mean the blazers would have only been the 5th seed ,35,554760078967878080,+14252837314
Orlando showed signs ,831,554760052158541184,+15038833302
East is sneaky good tho ,831,554760049981139904,+15038833302

Are we as white as Milwaukee? I think we covered this but just want to confirm ,48,554759714979159808,+15035806566
Raptors or blazers? ,35,554759712446332224,+14252837314
Ok who had a better record against the west? ,35,554759702285474560,+14252837314

And how white it is ,831,554759669235942592,+15038833302
Probably also a reason why players don’t wanna play here ,25,554759657688381888,+15035513466

You may or may not notice that there's a seemingly direct correlation between our country's most predominately black cities and our country's most segregated cities.

Laughed at “I actually feel bad he’s got emotional issues”,0,554309340000788224,
I actually feel bad he’s got emotional issues,413,554309165566006208,+15035107079
KD is such a bitch I don’t care he argues with 14 year olds,413,554309154060350912,+15035107079
Anyone can say it! As long as someone is calling him out I love it,413,554309139504854208,+15035107079
Ok so where do you draw the line!!!,35,554309124666833664,+14252837314
It’s the same thing ,413,554309124186654080,+15035107079
Fucking big cat could tell him,413,554309116442563072,+15035107079
Oh no of course not ,413,554309109840112448,+15035107079
Bro I'm saying if Kelly said what cj said ,35,554309101301004672,+14252837314
He isn’t a superstar ,413,554309086928289664,+15035107079
He also isn’t the same person. Olynyk CAN join a super tram and get a ring it’s fine ,413,554309078818143104,+15035107079
Wut?,35,554309077001305344,+14252837314
"Ian, Kelly Olynyk isn’t acting like KD ",413,554309063166319360,+15035107079
Is it really shit talking?,0,554309027930296640,
I'm fine with this take ,35,554308996475033024,+14252837314
Lol ok as long as your willing to admit the same shit talking right extends to Kelly olynyk ,35,554308991639055040,+14252837314
I feel like you’re just doing this because Cj is a blazer Ian lol,413,554308966277141824,+15035107079
And it’s a joke ,413,554308953379884224,+15035107079
And now wants us to kiss that ring and bow down to him,413,554308950709769728,+15035107079
If it’s the truth don’t matter who said it ,0,554308947610883264,
To get a ring ,413,554308943933688384,+15035107079
Who had to join the best team ,413,554308941761464832,+15035107079
How about tobias Harris? ,35,554308938447293504,+14252837314
The whole point is KD was a superstar ,413,554308936552253696,+15035107079
Ian those scenarios aren’t the same ,413,554308927321557056,+15035107079
So where do you draw the line? ,35,554308904263063936,+14252837314
Lol and cj isn't close to the caliber player of KD,35,554308892262160320,+14252837314
The problem I have is KD wants to be recognized as a champion ,413,554308881861360064,+15035107079
Olynyk isn’t out there telling everyone he’s a great champion ,413,554308872699042112,+15035107079
Dude Kelly isn’t close to the player CJ is hahaha,48,554308867044487936,+15035806566
KD still thinks he’s the shit ,413,554308860036761024,+15035107079
He wouldn’t ,413,554308855292482112,+15035107079
So Charles Barkley can’t talk shit to anyone with a ring?,48,554308854061213952,+15035806566
Can Kelly olynyk talk that wild shit? ,35,554308848541867712,+14252837314
KD has two fake rings. Most guys in the league don’t have rings,48,554308840618502592,+15035806566
Then yeah it’s different ,413,554308838488775744,+15035107079
If you’re just shit talking someone ,413,554308832650109312,+15035107079
That’s where lol,413,554308827484705216,+15035107079
"Dude they’re peers at the end of day. Once again, CJ isn’t some bench warmer",48,554308827443096640,+15035806566
The truth,413,554308825129613888,+15035107079
Ok so where do we draw the line,35,554308820334466944,+14252837314
That’s where you gotta stick to your guns if you know it’s the truth Idk ,413,554308812009480000,+15035107079
I mean you CAN ,35,554308791713913216,+14252837314
Will they be that way if what you’re saying is true tho Ian? ,413,554308789095684992,+15035107079
"Lol that’s a ridiculous requirement. So nobody but Lebron can say something to KD now? Like clay said, nobody is saying CJ is better. CJ isn’t even saying “hey my shitty team can beat yours”. He’s just saying your a huge pussy and that move was soft as hell ",48,554308773050557120,+15035806566
That’s kinda fucked ,413,554308744143067136,+15035107079
What if the shit talking is true tho? We throw truth out the window because he’s lesser than KD?,413,554308740749696704,+15035107079
"If I talk a bunch of shit about someone at work or in the industry who is way more accomplished than me, people are gonna be like ""who the fuck are you?"" ",35,554308739673940160,+14252837314
"For the record, I wanted to trade CJ I’m not backing him up as a blazer fan here. He supports Portland Gear too much for me but this was awesome just as a fan of shitting on KD for doing this ",413,554308682871505472,+15035107079
lol kinda Chad ,35,554308680059201024,+14252837314
Unless he wins somewhere else ,413,554308613831359360,+15035107079
KD pulled what I consider the biggest bitch move in the history of sports doing this. His legacy will always be “yeah but....” ,413,554308602923912256,+15035107079
?,413,554308557324246912,+15035107079
No one is arguing KD isn’t better as a player in every way but why does that mean Cj can’t call him out for being a bitch and fucking up the competitive balance of the nba ,413,554308555789288512,+15035107079
Good on him,413,554308516333884032,+15035107079
Emphasized “No one is arguing CJ vs KD”,48,554308514116979392,+15035806566
He just happens to be a peer and is saying what everyone else wanted to,413,554308512291051840,+15035107079
Lol so do you have to be KD’s equal in talent to talk shit to him now? When did that ever become a requirement ,48,554308498973399424,+15035806566
You could call CJ a podcast host for all I care. I’m glad he said it period. ,413,554308494410888448,+15035107079
lol it's a better situation bc it's kd,35,554308489228209728,+14252837314
No one is arguing CJ vs KD,413,554308475491301312,+15035107079
No they didn’t KD has always had a better situation than CJ has,413,554308460980487616,+15035107079
Or any other team with an inferior record ,35,554308453178940992,+14252837314
I’m impressed and proud that CJ did it ,413,554308448302603968,+15035107079
Lol yeah but no kd team ever got bounced in four games by the pelicans ,35,554308440953282368,+14252837314
Emphasized “It’s just finally time for someone to just say it to his face ”,48,554308428533270592,+15035806566
It’s just finally time for someone to just say it to his face ,413,554308421860533248,+15035107079
People have been saying it ,413,554308408416859392,+15035107079
Plus CJ is a top 30 player. Has a 100 million dollar contract and a big shoe deal. It’s not like he’s some bum,48,554308405477231296,+15035806566
CJ is speaking for the entire league Dubov ,413,554308401410868160,+15035107079
So only players with rings can talk shit to KD? His rings are fake anyways he doesn’t get that kinda respect ,48,554308344689281920,+15035806566
My bias is showing but fuck KD and #LongLiveTrashTalkCJ,105,554281126883333952,+19714099773
CJ has no cred,210,554280902672283392,+15039972480
"At the end of the day, KD has chips and CJ has a sweep at the hands of the Pellys.",210,554280864418576704,+15039972480
Here’s my thing. I agree that KD is soft. And that he deserves to be owned. But not by CJ.,210,554280852959220864,+15039972480
Emphasized “This makes up for all the corny Meyers workout videos I’ve had to endure ”,105,554280790125921984,+19714099773
Just showing everyone how soft he is ,120,554277150172082432,+14153064486
Hopefully people start bodying KD like they did with Dwight a while back ,120,554277143262245440,+14153064486
I arrived at a conclusion... Team CJ,120,554277126313827776,+14153064486
I’ve gone back and forth on the subject ,120,554277118210859328,+14153064486
I’m started to like him more ,413,554276840655323520,+15035107079
This makes up for all the corny Meyers workout videos I’ve had to endure ,48,554275802332612288,+15035806566

The raptors have a way better shot to make the finals than we do,25,553615879930765120,+15035513466
Moreso like is it really making a difference or did we just give away CJ for a 4 seed and first round exit which we can do WITH CJ and he’ll be here for a while ,413,553615483617305984,+15035107079
Idk if that’s as much what I care about ,413,553615440594200832,+15035107079

Would we be that much better?,413,553615169219981184,+15035107079
Yeah but “good” is relative to the other elite teams. We’d still be better without a doubt. And that’s the whole goal anyways. If he leaves at least we took a gamble and will have a ton of cap space when ET and Meyers come off the books ,48,553615136354458816,+15035806566

Yes 100%. I don’t see how putting up a huge stat line means you can’t also rally your team in the huddle? They kinda go hand in hand ,48,549825258993840448,+15035806566

Man I disagree,210,549824958460663808,+15039972480
Yes I do,48,549824953973154048,+15035806566
If he just came in screaming and yelling and told them to forget all that shit. Picked up JR. said it’s 0-0 let’s play our ass off for 5 minutes and steal this win,48,549824943140104768,+15035806566
Do you really think that even with LeBron saying something in the huddle they even had a chance at that point?,210,549824941330827968,+15039972480
True. But I feel like he admitted defeat at that point. Not addressing the situation meant it was a given they’d get slaughtered in overtime. Which they did,48,549824910974908608,+15035806566
I think he’s just finally been broken,210,549824418939448128,+15039972480
I think generally he’s pretty great about building up his teammates. Nobody else in the league would be as forgiving and encouraging with this group.,210,549824409277921408,+15039972480
And it became obvious in that moment he’s going to have to do it alone,210,549824365426003456,+15039972480
In that moment he had just put up 50+ and done literally everything to win the game for his team,210,549824312928801280,+15039972480
I think maybe y’all need to cut him some slack,210,549824296551737792,+15039972480
Yeah - I feel like the way he handles teamates making mistakes in tough situations is piss poor.,105,549824277501287232,+19714099773

The rockets literally play one big man. With a bunch of defending and scoring wings around him. That’s how the modern game is played. Olsheys entire strategy just seems so random ,48,549078850651720256,+15035806566

She implied he’s complicit in allowing barstool’s sexism to exist basically ,25,548724826157765632,+15035513466
She definitely was ,413,548724803958972672,+15035107079
Dude she wasn't critical of pft at all ,35,548724795359040768,+14252837314
Not that she’s wrong to hate Dave she absolutely is. ,413,548724790242876544,+15035107079
Idea*,413,548724773749156224,+15035107079
She is but she also is out to kill PFT over the dies she hates his boss ,413,548724770575547712,+15035107079
Clearly she's qualified to write it ,35,548724752342300160,+14252837314

Yeah no thanks Gunz ,413,548724703757998720,+15035107079
What we really need to talk about is Boston’s dominance of the sports media ,25,548724695748702080,+15035513466
Yet his fans are insane. Like trump fans ,413,548724686042719872,+15035107079

Lol,35,548724665468230976,+14252837314
Yeah probably ,35,548724664462216128,+14252837314
He’s a rich white kid from the burbs of Boston who probably grew up a racist and sexist and got rewarded with fame ,413,548724652887087808,+15035107079

Is it just me or is grouping PMT as barstool and barstool only and going after them is like going after Dan LeBatard when you’re going after ESPN for what they stand for?,951,548724281822567232,dylanbranch9@icloud.com
And those same guys don’t really go consume other barstool content other than PMT ,413,548723884776430592,+15035107079

Also ,35,548723747913296192,+14252837314
I feel like his schtick has always been a more humorous one,25,548723746722344640,+15035513466
I dunno he's been at it a long time ,35,548723724617274304,+14252837314
Yes he’s the post but he’s supposed to be the fun sports guy at the post ,25,548723703966079488,+15035513466
I don’t take that Steinberg guy very seriously ,25,548723692143519616,+15035513466
I mean thy interviewed Magary do the article ,35,548723682569523072,+14252837314
Deadspin is mostly pro pft,35,548723667116359232,+14252837314
Fair enough but it’s also the WaPo sports blogger guy,25,548723654362535488,+15035513466
I know but he Washington post is held to a higher standard ,35,548723638608102080,+14252837314
Yeah I agree with space. I don’t think it’s a witch hunt about PFT himself. It’s more that WaPo gave him softball questions ,48,548723633213819968,+15035806566
Absolutely ,35,548723613562153792,+14252837314
Unfortunately that’s most sports related content in 2018,25,548723611671647040,+15035513466

The issue is the questioned ha we're asked ,35,548723563201534272,+14252837314
I don't think their was at issue with how pft answered the questions ,35,548723547950714560,+14252837314
Washington post does ,35,548723522273969920,+14252837314
Dude he doesn't ,35,548723517356193536,+14252837314
They're too sensitive bc they published an article without carefully considering how sensitively it would be taken by the people calling them too sensitive? ,35,548723505938190912,+14252837314
I just think it’s weird to frame it as though PFT has a responsibility to anyone other than himself ,25,548723475334918272,+15035513466
I don’t think it’s a problem that they published it ,25,548723459361391808,+15035513466
Lol so they shouldn't publish because their fans can't handle light criticism? ,35,548723443410165056,+14252837314
They can’t be that naive ,25,548723421211828224,+15035513466
Maybe they weren’t trying but they also probably knew the reaction from their fans ,25,548723403754371904,+15035513466
"Which makes it so ironic everyone's souring about them being ""sensitive"" ",35,548723386122383104,+14252837314

Deadspin I guess was upset that WaPo didn’t say that,25,548723146832813248,+15035513466
You could literally google it and it would be on the first page ,25,548723112810437184,+15035513466

It's not like he's Voldemort ,831,548722637873934720,+15038833302
And the writer for deadspin has been harassed by the head of barstool ,25,548722630716813056,+15035513466
Deadspin posted PFTs real name after the Washington Post did a thing on him where they were very congratulatory of him but didn’t say his name. ,25,548722600575927744,+15035513466
Barstool is immature. Deadspin is petty. People like to be angry on the internet.,210,548722576205186368,+15039972480
Yeah can someone give Dylan and I the tl;dr,48,548722544811002752,+15035806566

"Dude they co-host a podcast.

It's the post. Not people mag. ",35,548719684595286144,+14252837314
I just find it interesting that deadspin - a site that built it’s reputation on making fun of people in sports - has a problem with barstool,210,548719649207563136,+15039972480
She should go after him,210,548719533964110144,+15039972480

I don’t think him being on the spurs is the issue,25,548712414828400384,+15035513466
Idk,25,548712400157974720,+15035513466
He’s still boring ,25,548712385871075648,+15035513466
I just don’t think moving to LA or NY changes things that much for him idk,25,548712374548415872,+15035513466
I bet he'd sell some shoes ,35,548712363567323904,+14252837314
If he was the best player on a major market team ,35,548712353299944384,+14252837314

So they get Fultz and still have two firsts ,48,548711308107580928,+15035806566
10 pick comes from philly,48,548711286293647040,+15035806566
Clippers would still have picks 13 and 24,48,548711280435000192,+15035806566
Tobias plus two top 12 picks is higher reward chance than Fultz imo ,0,548711232392050048,
Yeah he may only be “worth” the 10 pick right now. But if he figures his shit out he’ll be light years better than what a 10 pick is worth. His ceiling is way higher than a guy someone will get at the end of the lottery this year,48,548711219563435584,+15035806566
Yeah idk. It’s definitely hard to gauge. I would just view it as higher risk but higher reward. It’s a roll of the dice ,48,548711163981675840,+15035806566
You can think he’ll be okay. But you have to factor in that risk for a trade ,0,548711047775589248,
There’s a lot of risk with him,0,548711032798790208,
I’m just saying if you would t draft him at 10 right now you would t trade the 10th pick for him ,0,548711025729850048,
I mean he’s clearly lost some value. It’s upped the risk factor. But outside of his shooting (which a lot of people think is just mental) he proved true on all his other attributes ,48,548710988114561344,+15035806566

If the pistons had a lottery pick this year maybe Dylan. But I’d rather ride with Nurk and Collins and get another scorer for CJ. Plus a pick,48,548710543001306560,+15035806566
Noooo Brock he has more value than that. I think most people think he’ll be fine long term. This isn’t another Anthony Bennett ,48,548710488116832704,+15035806566

"When guacamole spread to other parts of the world, the familiar ingredients came to be thought of as the right ones because adding them to guacamole made it taste like guacamole made in Mexico. If your favorite guacamole recipe contains those familiar ingredients, that is fine. Make the guacamole that tastes best to you, because its only purpose is to taste good to the people who will be eating it. If it contains peas, that is fine. It is mashed avocado dip; the right way to make it is so it tastes good.",35,546907880403273600,+14252837314
"Commonly, guacamole is made with onion, chili peppers, citrus juice, and salt; these came to be familiar guacamole ingredients not because they are right, but because they were available in the area of guacamole’s origin. If ancient Aztec guacamole happened not to contain peas, that is because there were no peas around. In the ancient Levant, they didn’t have avocados or chili peppers or the Aztec language, so they made their guacamole with cooked garbanzo beans and tahini and called it “hummus.”",35,546907855306600320,+14252837314

Stotts may be bottom 5 nba coaches in adjustments. Before CP and Blake got hurt 2 years ago they doubled Dame on the pick and rolls and completely eliminated him as a threat. We had no answer whatsoever ,48,545724246105230784,+15035806566
I agree Houman. Astute observation ,48,545724184327702016,+15035806566
Stotts is has no idea how to adjust to this. Same thing happened last year. Dame gets doubled on pick/rolls. Dame has to force a switch then take advtange of that switch by himself or have the post up the switch man. Instead dame when he gets doubled on the screens jams himself in and has to wait for the double to go away. ,60,545723582866405696,+15037895186

Yes ,25,545594361777030720,+15035513466
"Also ""plays defense"".....We sure he does that well Gunz? ",413,545594282122729088,+15035107079
True ,413,545594267132845888,+15035107079
No guarantee he's even good ,35,545594241582140672,+14252837314
Yeah also as of now lonzo is a below replacement level pg,35,545594240388210752,+14252837314
That shit could blow up so easily if Lavar decides he wants it to,413,545594234434835200,+15035107079
It's crazy to think Lonzo won't be back to his normal self if Lebron comes,413,545594211172113408,+15035107079
Like LeBron’s dream situation ,25,545594210493095424,+15035513466

No way ,25,545594191996993792,+15035513466
Yeah but I just think Lebron is so controlling over his situation if anything they trade away Lonzo too,413,545594180056980160,+15035107079
Dude he got way better as the season went along,25,545594160707189312,+15035513466
"Also, I haven’t heard shit from Lavar lately. Is he still alive?",210,545594123873357056,+15039972480
I don’t think Lebron would let some schmuck keep him from what he wants,210,545594114407154816,+15039972480
I'm with you Clay. I don't think it's impossible. But very unlikely bron wants to put up with that,48,545594113367858432,+15035806566
Am I wrong? ,413,545594070852034816,+15035107079
I just think there's no way Lebron would go to a team with Lonzo knowing Lavar is there,413,545594061118651840,+15035107079
Kawhi would be a trade. So they'd just send outgoing salaries. But yeah I don't think that'd work,48,545594039410196288,+15035806566
Wait how can they afford 3 max players ,210,545593989093038336,+15039972480
Bron won't do it if Lavar is around no way,413,545593981769132864,+15035107079

I'm no mathematician but playing 90% of snaps seems to be up to coaches discretion on who should be on the field. Which is the opposite of controlling your own destiny and easily exploitable by the team ,48,542589600576720448,+15035806566
