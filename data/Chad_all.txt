The sole fact that he cheated on his pregnant wife with a porn star should nullify any Christian from supporting him The only way you could top that is by copping some food stamps for beer and pizza while you watch the game Wait please tell me you signed up for unemployment in California while living in Washington. That's even better Remember when everyone made fun of the Cousins trade? Buddy Hield's kinda nice Vivek is light years ahead of us That's fucking insane I remember when we used to get stoked on a batum 5x5 game when he had like 10 points Holy fuck Players averaging at least 14 points, 10 rebounds, 3 assists, 1.3 blocks and 1 steal per game:

Anthony Davis
Giannis 
Jusuf Nurkic Your cherry picked stat of the day, and evidence were winning the ship this year Another stat for you guys today. This is for small sample size Dubov Seth Curry is leading the league in 3pt %. Only qualified player over 50%! What's all this PG for MVP talk Remember when olshey wouldn't include cj in a trade for him https://www.instagram.com/p/BsKG7gmhM7B/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=1mfkc4lyzzjss Yo Remember when Greg Monroe and Roy Hibbert turned down our max offers. Lol thank the lord S/O to hedo's wife Wow harden for MVP Fuck golden state! I think that was the best game I've seen all year Harden is unreal man. I hate all his flops and travels but that dude is the real deal If I need one bucket with the game on the line. I'm going with harden Definitely Dude that was so bad hahaha. Idk if I've ever seen anything that blatant missed He was sitting courtside when he tapped that https://twitter.com/cp3/status/1081070635810521088?s=21 Hey guys check it out. I bought a house today ? Thanks dudes! Yes all JCSL members are welcome anytime. Look me up if you're in Denver I'm trying to put together a boys trip out here in like May once it gets warmer and I get to know the area. I'll keep y'all posted! I'm also 15 minutes from red rocks so if there's any dope concerts worth traveling for this summer let me know So if jimmy butler wants out this summer can we S&T CJ for him? Or is he a certified team killer at this point Yeah I feel that. Dude is fucking delusional for sure I'm just trying to figure out where we could find more talent. Not the draft cuz we only pick white guys Is Kevin love still on the table? Bring him home Hahahah dude with what fucking assets You're gonna give spaceman a heart attack from laughter Jaylen brown, Hayward, Rozier and a couple firsts? Idk True but AD is a generational talent And all 3 of those guys are coming off the bench! He's gonna lose rozier anyway Can't pay him And brown and Hayward are marginalized with Tatum and kyrie taking so many shots Yeah every conversation ends there let's be honest. Neil ain't doing shit They say no player has turned down the super max, but I feel like Kawhi and boogie both did. They demanded trades before it was offered but I'm sure they would have got it I'm so glad we kept CJ over PG! God CJ is such trash Right He's had two of those now this year and bricked them both. Bad decision on that one but he still had a clean look The pitch forks are out for a CJ trade. He's gotten consistently worse each of the last 3 years https://www.instagram.com/p/BsQm7_Kgwpc/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=sk0vn3ue5ylj Jon Bernthal's fuckin dope When's the punisher coming back Wtf was that kick God CJ can't even take capela off the dribble Off course Neil would wait so long we have to sell low if we pull the trigger If he's the real 10gawd you'll put your 401k on the money line https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1082067326135160833?s=21 Woj bomb! It's almost like these full authority Coach/President roles don't workout or something There's only one Pop Omg lmao how is that possible I'm sorry you had to sell that sorry history to put food on the table rengel How do we not have an aerial drone view of that extension by now Hahahahaha holy shit Cam I got an extra pair of concords if you want em or know anyone who does 11 Probably too small for your lanky ass Haha it's a compliment. Big feet... Lol Clemson channeling suge knight has me dying Also love that our bench couldn't hold a 20 point lead against the fucking Knicks so they had to put the starters back in to finish the game Hot take: the players are out on CJ too. I'm sensing some animosity in post game huddles lately https://www.instagram.com/p/BsXG4ffASih/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=1l9vkz6xlvhpr I had no idea dhop played hoops Is she a Knicks cheerleader If her names Jess I hooked up with a Knicks cheerleader in Vegas back in 2015 I still think about her sometimes https://twitter.com/boasmohajer/status/1082457876919189505?s=21 https://twitter.com/thetimelinepod/status/1082318390088237057?s=21 And to think I used to sell this shit on a stick He'll fit right in Arizona with that 35-40 career coaching record That's gotta be it. Otherwise I have no idea why people love him so much He just got fired at lower tier college program, was gonna be the offensive coordinator at a pac 12 school and all the sudden Arizona thinks he'd be a great NFL head coach?? Lmao Everyone is trying to find Sean mcvay 2.0 "Idk Bob, If you squint hard he kinda looks like McVay" You're hired! I thought Bruce arians retired So basically they're trying to see if Cleveland helped him out by signing a offer sheet GS wouldn't match, then cutting him before contracts guarantee so that Cleveland is on the hook for nothing and McCaw can sign where he pleases? Why would Cleveland even risk that tho? What did they gain. A middle finger to the warriors? But yeah fuck the warriors and their bitch ass snitches Yeah it's not like they needed him I'd do that in a heartbeat Too bad Neil is asleep at the wheel. Has anyone even seen him recently? Does he even go to games anymore? CJ is so bad. We need him outta here asap CJ is basically Lou Williams Jimmy 2 PDX? https://twitter.com/sportscenter/status/1083187871643848704?s=21 Lmao watch this replay. Longest .8 seconds of all time Could we swap Solomon hill for etwaun Moore? He's kinda nice Redbull has to be so pissed about that hahaha Yeah i feel that Randle is a beast Oh my god That was fucking terrible Also why are we pushing CJ so hard? Nurk has been our 2nd best player this year Haha Dubov you're totally right You guys wanna know something depressing? Next season Meyers will be tied for 6th longest tenure in Trail Blazers history ? Great season to playoff ratio there for Pryz and Outlaw Travis outlaw was Meyers before Meyers Hung on for 7 seasons. All we talked about was his "potential". Then he leaves the blazers and can't even make another NBA team aka he never should have been on our team Should we see if I can get blocked by Meyers on insta this morning? https://www.instagram.com/timtebow/p/BsdzZV2nago/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=1hidzi3i5wmko Tebow's finally gonna have sex!!!! So there's this new guy that's been posting a ton on blazers edge lately and he has to be trolling He just suggested CJ, Simons and Collins for TJ Warren, Ryan Anderson and PHX's 1st round pick. Then to flip the PHX pick and our first for Jordan Clarkson lmao Lmaoooo ? ?Salem's own! Nurk making an appearance on Lowe's 10 things ? Gundy how reliable is sporting news with rumors? If you say very, I'm gonna jump off a bridge Ok good I'll back away from the ledge now Lol yeah I feel that A first for Jeremy Lin would be my final straw He also said Vonleh could fetch a first from a contender. That would be another epic Neil fail Lmaoooo omg RIP dale Davis Omg that's amazing https://www.instagram.com/p/BslgFBQnFCA/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=1mdo2cfdl1uev Eagles by 100 Not a great year for kickers Oh boy Jeffrey done fucked up Meyers just hit an off the dribble fade-away. Is this the twilight zone Jokic is clowning Meyers so hard rn Calabro is heated lmao Malik Beasley and Will Barton killing us tonight and Aaron afflalo ain't even in the league anymore smh. Great trade Neil Two best teams in the west How so? I thought we played it perfectly. Just shitty Defense and no box out by Aminu The two for one with 30 seconds left outta the timeout was perfect Dude if Aminu grabbed that board we have the ball with 4 seconds left. Inbounding from half court. Down by 1 We had a timeout I mean I guess you could do that but is down 3 with 24 seconds left really that much better? Then you have to go quick 2 and play a free throw game or go for 3, then get a stop for OT Yeah but if we got the rebound we wouldn't have had to run that shitty play for a 3. Now you're down 1 and they have to guard the paint as well Or experiencing night terrors from The Jordan Bell rebounding fiasco in the final four Damn Clint capela out 4-6 weeks And fuck you bob Meyers and your petty BS Hahaha wait trump actually bought Clemson Wendy's for dinner. I thought he was joking. Or that someone would talk him out of that ? Apparently he paid for it out of his own pocket, because since he shutdown the government the entire WH catering staff is furloughed So naturally he chose the cheapest food possible Yeah how did he not at least choose chick fil a Yeah Dubov is dropping nothing but facts. Trump eats fast food 24/7 Or if he splurges, a well done steak with ketchup Not even joking https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.businessinsider.com/how-presidents-eat-steak-2018-2 https://twitter.com/kicksdeals/status/1085015011091570688?s=21 Why are we fucking losing to Sacramento CJ is sure showing his chops as a 2nd option on a contender tonight 2-13 baby! Zach also getting outscored by not 1, but both guys we traded for him So fucking trash. And we're paying his bitch ass more than Giannis Smh fuck me Jesus Christ Dude CJ is a cancer can we please trade his ass What could we even get for him right now? Bob Covington? God that's depressing Olshey hung on so long we literally can't trade him now I'd do it But id also trade CJ for Dubov's middle schoolers Ross has been hoopin this year too Then maybe at halftime of a 76ers game, we could try to swap Simmons and Simmons. Nobody will notice What's great too is Trump can't even help himself with lying about fucking hamburgers. He said he bought 300 yesterday, now today he said he bought 1,000 lmao. Weird flex dude Does the Miami Heat have a better record than the Sacramento Kings?! I'm so glad our 3 first round picks made that list.... Dubov you don't got Dame in the all star game??? Lol wtf Lol duh Dame is going for 26/6/5 Doncic might not make it. No way rose makes it And I'm with Gundy on Adams. I think LaMarcus or Derozan over him Fan vote is only for starters tho And even then it's only 50% Media and players make up the rest And if you don't make starters, the bench is 100% coaches pick I believe Nah fan votes is only 50% ?This is my best guess. I could swap Harris for Derozan, Towns or Doncic easily Niel should wake his ass up and clock in for once. As anybody even seen him Interesting Watch him win them another heisman Dubov get your mans If it wasn't a shameless money grab to create and sell another stupid ass Jersey, the nba would do what's right and go back to this ? Wearing your own jersey will always be the best in my eyes. I remember being so hyped seeing Rasheed rocking the pinwheel with the best players in the league ?Holy shit I have a new favorite player I'm bringing that line to my local pickup game https://twitter.com/dame_lillard/status/1085662633879977984?s=21 Didn't peg dame for a Soulja fan https://twitter.com/kpelton/status/1085611551803957248?s=21 Dame $ Hahaha I've lost all hope Brock I'm gonna go by past actions. When was the last time olshey made a meaningful trade? Plumlee for Nurk? CJ gonna go 6-22 and be our third leading scorer tonight https://www.instagram.com/p/Bst_DkbBkvM/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=1likyfwmjo0m3 Wish we would've had a draft pick high enough to nab JA Let's trade Layman while his stock his high https://twitter.com/aznallin007/status/1085776461456265216?s=21 Lmao wtf https://www.instagram.com/p/Bsy6h86HT4_/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=1bo0gldblby46 Lmaoooo that's fucking amazing Of course the rockets are getting Faried Where's Neil at??? Better than biggie! Damn Gundy that ZC tweet blew up ?? ?Olshey burner confirmed And his collars aren't even big!! I didn't know execs had a W/L record lol Barely over .500 during his tenure. Woohoo! ?In case you guys were wondering what Wyoming looks like in January It was sarcastic cam. It was fucking miserable haha I was moving all my shit out to Denver and to avoid the Rocky Mountains you gotta drive north from salt lake through Wyoming to get to Denver Solid 20 hour drive through a ton of snow I did I did. Thanks brah Dudes the goat for a reason https://twitter.com/claytravis/status/1087348917438685186?s=21 Clay Travis so bitter he lost $25k on his saints SB pick Lol so the bulls have Jabari Parker exiled because he was a black hole on offense and played zero D, and they think Carmelo will fit? Why the trade then? Trade exception for Chicago? Oh good call. Jerry loves him some extra cash See Jordan Bell Pretty sad that two of the premier franchises in the nba are run by complete ass hats Nurk on quadruple double watch I'm talking myself into Layman being kinda good CJ dropping the grenade on Seth then chewing him out for the shot clock violation ?? CJ fucking sucks bro. I'm so out on him And so in on Layman omg Hey guys remember when we passed on Donovan Mitchell? Can't remember if we've covered this or not But hey we needed another big to sit on the bench in crunch time obviously Wtf just happened What a shitty call Trade cj. Build around dame and Layman Nurk is no joke our 2nd best player now Damn Ropp is dropping straight knowledge this morning. That sums up my thoughts exactly I feel that. Nothing in that thread was false tho Glorified scout is a great way to describe olshey He finds underrated players on the scrap heap but is clearly a Fucking terrible negotiator And let's his "eye for talent" tie him to his own picks too easily and get in the way of the business side when a trade should be made https://www.instagram.com/p/Bs8kGYTgBSE/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=3d4zoroyargi Yeah same. Only uneducated fans are losing their minds about that Looks like solid picks to me. PG is ballin out this year. 27 points a game is a nuts Most he ever averaged in Indiana is 23.7 For sure. Lebron should start and will definitely start But the article is purely basketball based which is what's fun to read Yeah Beal has been a beast since Wall went down I think he's even had a couple 40 point triple doubles Brock is 100% right You have to swing for the fences and get the guy in house to pitch him. But olshey refuses to do so. Says it's "too risky" If we traded for PG I'm convinced Dame could have got him to resign as well These are all straight facts The fact that olshey thinks he can take the same exact team that got run off the floor in round 1 next year, and somehow tell people we're better from internal development... Really dude? You swapped Patty fastball for Stauskus and Napier for Seth Curry. Big fucking deal. We'll lose 4-1 now instead of 4-0 Like, if that series doesn't spur a change of personnel, wtf will? Olshey also runs us like a business. He's too buddy buddy with McGowan. I bet he wants to run an organization eventually and is angling towards running a profitable team as his calling card Exactly. And Jody Allen being a passive owner helps his cause even more She's not gonna rock the boat either We're so fucked Dame is gonna be 34 before somebody finally grows some balls around here He's likely gonna be the greatest blazer ever and we're completely squandering his prime Unreal Wow I like that one Gundy Benefits both sides I mean they'd have to balance out money but those players would be the centerpiece ? ?Further evidence Nurk is our #2 And CJ didn't even make the list of pretty good guys lol My point exactly hoomie Cj is ?? I wish you could like the name change Gundy does Harkless ever have it? So much agreement with all this right now That's why we can't take the next step. Harkless, Aminu, Layman would be great if they were 7-9 guys. But having two of those dudes starting cripples us Preaching to the fucking choir. We should have thrown the kitchen sink at Indiana Hahaha I'm nit picking on this one, but Olshey shouldn't have swapped picks with the Cavs that year either. We had their 2018 pick and Neil swapped it for their 2017 pick so they could trade another first I feel like 2 picks in 2017 and 2 picks in 2018 is more valuable than 3 in one year. Indiana didn't want 3 picks the same year, what's the odds you even like 3 dudes in the first round No We have Dame and Nurk? Eh i wouldn't do it personally. Dame would have to play off the ball more and he's so damn good in the P&R We're all going to the blazers championship parade together some day. Don't care if it's 2067 Dame will be GM then This is true. Maybe this is the year Nurk is gonna play like a possessed love child of Walton and sabonis. Dame will go supernova Layman hits the game winner in game 7 Lol I saw josh huff is playing in that league Arizona Hotshots! https://www.instagram.com/p/Bs_ORWPn63g/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=jutp9c5dtrrq Wait.. how did I miss this lmao Embiid favorited nurk's tweet too lol Damn that blows Dude oladipo's trainer, who I usually really like, is being such a tool He posted a thing today ripping Indiana's trainers saying how this is their fault Basically trying to absolve himself of blame and to say that if oladipo was still working out with him, that wouldn't have happened Lol the trainer deleted the post Wow that's wild tho https://twitter.com/snytv/status/1088521245254144001?s=21 Knicks gettin spicy! Mark how stoked are you on the new J Cole song? Have you played it non stop? https://www.instagram.com/p/BtCCRwDgf6F/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=1qpvimlefi2mv Felton before discovering voodoo donuts https://www.instagram.com/p/BtC7ljFBJ4c/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=18rgtvax6cyej Caption shoulda been "DNP-CD" If the jazz get Otto Porter I'm done Quitting my fandom Brock have we got an analytics wrap up recently? I'm curious what the most commonly used words or phrases are I'm guessing some combo of Meyers and pussy Oh legit I'll be anxiously waiting Whoa whoa we don't just add outsiders Willy nilly This is correct. Or of course dame dolla himself Or Kristen ledlow. The list stops at 3 Ah yes that is an automatic add as well Dubov Wow we're more welcoming than I thought Someone should try getting ahold of catrons number and adding him in. Kid phe probably has it New year new Dubov That's gonna be a no from me I Just don't think Conley is that big a upgrade over cj And he's old and expensive and injured all the time We need a true 2 ?How bout something like this Buddy is fuckin killing it Maybe vlade wants to go "win now mode" They gonna reunite next year? Marginally And I hate CJ I'm not big on Conley or playing two PG's Factor in his contract and age. I'll pass The two PG's concerns me But I feel you We need to stop talking about potential and go for it at some point Defense? Harden is 6'6 True I just have night terrors of the Suns 3 PG system Idk. I'm not sold lol Let's be honest tho Sideline Neil ain't doing shit I'm with you This is true We should have got PG. it was there for the taking https://twitter.com/rivalsnation/status/1088997727873220608?s=21 Great trade Neil Haha space yes I remember that vividly That guy was shirtless and shoeless. And he literally just two hand tomahawked a fucking windshield Shattered it instantly https://youtu.be/oA4_4cwaeus Space remember when I thought weed was a gateway drug I was so concerned haha Hahaha well once I gave in I was like fuck it give me all the drugs Dude is Ryan Allen bout to get another super bowl ring Never forget that Rengel bought paper machete weed. And got robbed. All in the same night Oh wow Ian did get hit by a car hahaha I think cam Juarez witnessed it Tell them you're a blog boy ?KD is so sensitive lol Is he gonna jersey swap with Meyers? https://twitter.com/grantgoldberg/status/1089570658994929665?s=21 #NAME? Dude it's Anthony fucking Davis. Lakers gotta give up way more than that KCP, Ingram, Kuzma and Rondo + a First Or they can take our offer of CJ, Collins, Aminu and two firsts Oh for sure. Neil probably thinks CJ and AD are similarly talented "Look it doesn't make sense to mortgage the future for a guy who may be here for 18 months. That's not how you build a stable franchise in a small market" ?Dame getting interviewed after sideline Olshey says we're gonna sit out the AD sweepstakes Yeah cmon Houman be realistic here. You gotta pay to play I respect that. That cut deep Dame and AD are the two best players from the 2012 class. I think it's destiny he comes to Portland Trade the whole team minus Dame and Nurk. Guaranteed WCF https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1090022247031623680?s=21 The nba is so dramatic Nothing's gonna happen. $15k fine maybe I guess Kawhi requested directly to the team. That was picked up by beat writers. AD made a public statement himself It'll be a wrist slap Dude all these 2nd round "steals" that Olshey finds don't mean shit in the scheme of things when our top talent isn't good enough. Layman isn't gonna make an iota of difference against the warriors or in a trade Daryl Morey finds better guys than Layman in local Houston open gym runs Yeah he let Barton go, traded the pick that turned into Malik Beasley who's actually legit, should have sold high on crabbe or let him walk, might have given up on Vonleh too soon and essentially got nothing in return for Batum. Completely fucked up the swanigan pick I'm failing to see any positives here Two things on Vonleh: 1. I take him over Swanigan every day of the week 2. I think terry kinda fucked that one up. He didn't do a lot to help develop him Hahaha holy shit that's good God this is depressing. Anyone listen to the windy Lowe pod? Beck: "what if the blazers jump in (the AD sweepstakes) and offer CJ and Nurk?"

Lowe: "yeah but they'd never even make a call to New Orleans so it's a non starter" *changes subject* ?? Everyone knows he's sideline olshey I like how people thought that Lonzo was this Steph-lite long range bomber. Come to find his freshmen year shooting percentages were a complete fluke He'll have a long career. But he's been pretty damn underwhelming thus far His Defense is legit Holy shit you guys hear about that dude from empire that got attacked in Chicago? Fucking trump man. Bringing all the racists outta the shadows And yelled "this is MAGA country" https://twitter.com/hpbasketball/status/1090324527832129536?s=21 This is the ?? I needed today How's that different from last year mark? We're still playoff fodder. Good in the regular season, can't compete in the playoffs If you look at our record vs .500 or better teams the last few years it paints the whole picture. We have a losing record against good teams in the regular season, but we just win all the games we're supposed to Makes us look good in the regular season but then when we go up against another good team, with weeks to game plan against us. We get thrashed Stotts is also atrocious at in game adjustments Be we all know more of the blame lands on Olshey. Stotts has squeezed so much out of this roster. If olshey even remotely improved us around the fringes each year we'd be much better But he try's to sell continuity like that's gonna win a playoff series. It's not 1972 Yeah idk what the argument here is lol. Like Dubov said, more talent means less impact on coaching Smh god damn Fuck cj Dave decker makes a great point. Even if AD left in 2020 then we'd have $30 mil in cap space to add someone to Dame/Nurk before dame hits free agency Then Niel could secure another 5 years as he signals another "re-tool after star leaves". It's a win win I really don't understand the global warming deniers Worst case, it's not as drastic as scientists say, but in the meantime you made an effort to help the planet Hahaha yikes ? Interesting wrinkle to the Knicks bid for AD. They can't trade KP this summer cuz he'll be a restrictive FA. So if the Pelicans don't like their offer before the deadline that eliminates another bidder yeah? Yeah if we could pounce on Holiday, Mirotic and/or Randle That sure tells him!!!! Way to go Silver!!! Just listened to the entire 66 minute Dunc'd on mock trade deadline. Each guy represented a team and the Blazers weren't even mentioned in a mock trade https://twitter.com/bball_ref/status/1090385391318900736?s=21 ?? Fox is good tho That must be a real poor dude Mark is stoked! Best rapper alive https://twitter.com/sreekyshooter/status/1090493618798784512?s=21 Lmao this dude played espn Alright guys. As I exit the Bay this week a few thoughts/statements 
1. I got here the first year golden state won. Hopefully I'm leaving as they've won their last
2. The memes are accurate; 99.9% of people here don't know who Bob Sura or Erick Dampier are 
3. I left countless strangers hanging on high fives at bars cuz they just assumed everyone there was a warriors fan
4. 30% of people here think the NBA started in 2014
5. I tried starting a "fuck Steph Curry" chant at a Future concert during the finals two years ago. It didn't catch on I would love that Dubov cuz that means Curry eats shit in the playoffs. Also if that were to happen, you bet your ass I'm moving to Portland next year 100% ?Wow fancy that. Two weeks. Everyone down for nuggets heat in Denver? https://twitter.com/brkicks/status/1090705625615646721?s=21 We reject him. No thanks https://twitter.com/alexkennedynba/status/1090681105437650944?s=21 Hmm holding onto your draft picks as a small market team might have helped This is perfect. CJ plays up his value to headline an AD trade tomorrow Unfortunately, Dylan is 1000% correct ?? Hey guys remember when we could have traded CJ for AD and then had Donovan Mitchell slide in at the 2? Ok cool me too. Just your monthly reminder Meyers Red Bull dunk of the game again Lol. This is the worst return on ad spend maybe ever All star reserves announced tomorrow. If Lamarcus makes it he's for sure gonna be the last pick again Meyers played... good tonight? Did I actually just say that Wow that is fucking epic Help a small market brother out then Gayle God I can see it now CJ and Zach look like they appreciate a good beignet ?Everyone get your picks in I love that Dame is a lock this year Yeah he'll make it as a wild card The last spot IMO comes down to either Lamarcus, Tobias, Luca or Mitchell/Gobert Good point. Forgot about him I agree He's fucking killing it Who we trading for KP God we suck What?!!! WHERE IS SIDELINE OLSHEY!!! This is Fucking horseshit Dude NY could have had DSJ in the draft instead of Nkilita lmao It's probably DSJ, Barnes and We$ Oh good call Max slots Yeah man this is unreal. The inaction during the most hyper aggressive trade szn for stars ever is not gonna fly with dame Kawhi
PG
Porzingis
Jimmy Butler
Blake Griffin
CP3
Kyrie
Derozan
Demarcus Cousins All traded in the last 2 years and we weren't even mentioned in whispers Except they just used Porzingis to salary dump players and get a young player who they could have had for free 2 summers ago That's not great use of a top 25 player me thinks Also everyone knows why they didn't pick DSJ right? Phil Jackson wanted Frank to run the triangle Nice last parting gift from Phil Houman no matter how you spin it this wasn't a good trade lol Ok sure but good luck explaining this to the fans when they don't sign either of those guys ?True life: a blazers fan Deandre was a shell of himself this year too Called the west reserves exactly D Lo probably gets in as injury replacement for Oladipo Bill gargles balls of players for info all the time He's biased as hell Former blazer Malik Beasley with a cool 35 on the rockets tonight smh https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1091568224880201728?s=21 Lol that final piece really puts it over the top Someone catch me up We wouldn't include CJ in AD talks??? This is fantastic Gabe is worth his weight in gold right now Hahaha Dubov I'm dying Buy the table Neil! What's funny is that's slow af for him Holy fucking shit Brock lol (see why those are in the cloud).. this is epic Superliga MVP Jimmy sent 22 texts last year haha In version 2.0 can we get sentiment analysis? I'm guessing Meyers was 99% negative lol Space is definitely the most rapid fire texter. I feel like it's a visual representation of his conscious stream of thoughts Welcome to the dark side Gundy I can't remember, did he ever make an offer for Kawhi? Neil made a move! Holy shit he's alive Rodney hood on the jazz or Rodney hood in the playoffs last year? Which we getting? Neil over here putting lipstick on a pig It's all a sideshow Do we have any 2nds left in the next decade? IIRC we traded 2 for robin Lopez, 2 for Thomas Robinson, 2 for Jake Layman and 2 for Gary Trent Jokic mark Dudes bout to finish top 3 in mvp Goff looking a little nervous Why didn't Ryan Allen give us the Gatorade color I thought the corn syrup one was pretty good Love me some petty call outs of the competition Agreed Bud light needs to do a trump-esque "NO CORN SYRUP" tweet campaign Ludacris is always a winning move The dude! Jared Goff's in over his head man Is Jeff Fischer at the game? Love that they just dropped the song from the departed after that td Okay Goff Why's lebron talking shit about woj and shams? Did AD get traded? Is he drunk? That was such an awkward scene haha. That reporter just got squashed Then her body guard screaming "which camera is yours?!" https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1092494406438002699?s=21 Portland???? ?Zach Collins, Anfernee Simons, Aminu, 2 first round picks, and CJ for AD and Solomon Hill Young players: ??
Picks: ??
All-nba potential: ??
Cap relief: ?? Olshey's forte is selling the allure of "young players" and "promise and potential". He does it to our fan base every summer. This should be easy Shit. If we're even lucky ?"You're telling me Caleb Swanigan doesn't get your engine going?" Hahahahah That's the pussiest shit I've ever seen. Why are people this dumb Nobody is saying they think they can be in the nba. We're saying Meyers gets paid millions of dollars to be the best of the best, so he deserves all the criticism in the world if he can't play up to par. He signed up for this shit. Be better or take a hike it's that simple Go cry on a stack of money Dope ass dunk but everyone giving him a 360 needs to chill lol I feel like he's talking league wide. Something from Haynes maybe. Olshey doesn't even talk to him lol Bill's trade value article was updated today. CJ has a worse trade value than John Collins Yeah wtf. How did he do that sitting on the bench Gotta be the worst contract in the league No Fucking way he slipped hahaha Perfect symbolism of the wizards franchise Right as his Super Max kicks in ?? ?Keep gettin dem checks President, John Wall Houman could you save him?? Fly Dr Mirtorabi in asap!! NFL players gotta be so pissed right now. That happens to a QB and they just cut his ass and don't pay him Sham ??! Marc Gasol to Charlotte potentially Y'all are giving me serious fomo Omg I love you guys. Matt can you crop me and Cam in Also I'm so glad jimmy and his 22 texts joined you guys. What a pleasant surprise https://www.instagram.com/p/Bthvd2Ag_3C/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=wcaedyhsontr You guys are lucky you don't have to listen to this trash TNT broadcast. I wish we could listen to wheels instead They tried some "players only" stunt tonight. Aka the b squad from nbaTV and it failed miserable On TNT? I see KG's thing or the studio crew but not the broadcast team But maybe I missed it. This shit is awful Meyers. Wtf CJ playing up that trade value again Layman ??????? Fuck you spaceman!!! D Wade / Meyers jersey swap tho?? Lmao nah it was Lillard Jesus the clippers just gave up Tobias for two firsts? What the hell are they doing Isn't it only one? The other pick is the sixers which will be late twenties I know. I'm just saying only one prized pick The 76ers pick ain't blowing anyone away Also how dumb is Phoenix for trading that to move up 6 spots in the draft lmao Makes sense. Hey props to anyone willing to take a big swing. I'd take that over conservative olshey I have a strange feeling one of either jimmy or Tobias won't resign this summer tho Neil ain't doing shit. This just gets fans off his back for a couple months We're in a weird spot too cuz if Hood plays too well for us, he plays himself into a higher contract and off the team. So we have to root for him to play well but not TOO well We can only offer him like 5.5 mil a year What if he drops 25/5 in a playoff game? Some dumb GM will throw the MLE at him Don't underestimate dumb GM's lol All it takes is one https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1093184617178415105?s=21 Wait Gundy is this substantiated? I thought this was a cyber dust source. Don't play me like that Gundy Olshey is sitting on his hands til summer Yeah seriously Haha negative thoughts only cmon Can we get Wayne Ellington with our extra roster spot? Omg They salary dumped him WHAT THE FUCK https://twitter.com/br_nba/status/1093256390167199750?s=21 Lol he's tired of missing all star games Sooooo is olshey gonna make another move? Or do we need to brush off the pitchforks tomorrow He's worth a first tho ain't he? We don't need another simons Okay but you forget about bird rights There's value in being able to resign that player It's not like you're only paying for 3 months worth of him Wtf We could have had him too! Fucking joke I would take either porter or Barnes in a heartbeat at the 3 https://twitter.com/pdxtimmay/status/1093350693451091968?s=21 If this isn't sobering (Regarding the kings) Exactly The players are getting pissed https://twitter.com/shamscharania/status/1093361595709825024?s=21 For Mirotic?? https://twitter.com/davidaldridgedc/status/1093362969029865473?s=21 Wow Washington is having a fire sale Brad Beal next? https://twitter.com/davidaldridgedc/status/1093365599554674688?s=21 Okay Neil I'll settle for Trevor ariza What happened with KD God he's so fucking sensitive Right I saw lebrons pussy ass post about Barnes too I'm team media on this one And I'm also souring on lebron. He's kind of a bitch Exactly. He doesn't give a fuck about other players Can we at least get Aaron Gordon or something Or ariza https://twitter.com/fireneilolshey/status/1093264011829760000?s=21 Hahaha unfortunately not. I wish. Mad respect for that dude tho Lmao we've traded a few tweets. We share the same level of hatred Did you guys see the windy report about how the pelicans have been playing the lakers this entire time? https://www.instagram.com/p/BtkQeLqBk3K/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=9i4wa23565k4 Omg Another one!!! What is Neil doing These guys are being had for peanuts This is inexcusable Unbelievable It's not like Neil didn't have a front row seat to Mirotic slaughtering us last year. Cuz he literally did I literally can't think of anyone I hate as much as Neil olshey I'd rather have John Nash and Steve Patterson back McGowan probably And he loves Neil cuz he's about increasing the bottom line. Both of them are about ticket sales Omg sauce and Baldwin hit the road again lmao https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1093572477077336064?s=21 4th team this week! ?- from trader bob interview I feel like I know a guy who makes excuses about Portland regularly https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1093576610060685314?s=21 Sweet Jesus Christ. That didn't even make my dick move A swap of two draft busts God what a fucking disaster that number 1 pick was Jonathan Simmons lmao As soon as Ainge said yes to the trade they should have said JK. It's like dealing with Bellicheck ? Neil's fault again. If he handled the exit better Wes for sure would have come back Can we get Z-bo?? Where's the photoshopped one with me and cam ?? Hahahaha Haha god fuck that guy So Neil officially admitted the Swanigan pick was an absolute bust Had Josh Hart and Jordan Bell on the board We getting Rodney hood tonight?! Holy shit haha That was epic I like how LA bitched about playing center all the time here. Now he's a full time center Lmao yeah he sure did Yo Layman is kinda dope So our number 10 pick last year is now the 11th man. Is that good? God if only Rodney could play like this every game I hope Shaq actually pays nurks fine ?This was outside my office yesterday. Still went to work. When you're a Coloradan nothing phases you #beenhere5days https://twitter.com/keithsmithnba/status/1093875398562205696?s=21 Everyone except Portland Guys we had 3 first round draft picks in one of the deepest drafts in years and I'll Neil has to show for it is a 10th man who's out of the rotation If he would have mildly succeeded we could be a 3 seed lock right now We literally traded up to 10 to pick a backup center when we needed starters at 3 and 4 ?This is Peltons value per pick. Do you think we overpaid trading 15 and 20 for 10? The MLB is changing the Disabled List to the Injured List because people were offended with the word disabled ??????? Swear https://twitter.com/jeffpassan/status/1093619730076835840?s=21 ?Should I cop the joker jersey Haha I'm kidding cam. Rip city 4 ever https://twitter.com/chrisbhaynes/status/1094039712648445952?s=21 DOPE Thanks Neil!!! Yeah don't you just love cheering for such an aggressive franchise ?Simons gets up just slightly ?? https://www.instagram.com/p/BtpWaOegagK/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=bbh8akdifgvi Ted leonis rocking that tire round the waist bod https://twitter.com/alexkennedynba/status/1094472890039394304?s=21 Man good thing we didn't include CJ in any PG offers. That woulda been disastrous What the fuck just happened We scored 9 points in the 4th Completely agree. Terry is a good assistant that's it https://twitter.com/chold/status/1094728743422173184?s=21 Dope Lol have you been living under a rock https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1094989798782263296?s=21 Woj ??! Buyout market is crazy man. Rich get richer Morris, Gortat and Kanter are still available yeah? I would have given CJ and my left nut for PG right now No doubt. We're literally the definition of the treadmill of mediocrity right now Fun regular season team, will never win a round in the playoffs. Every smart move or step forward we make is accompanied by one or two steps back We literally lucked into 3 first round picks in one season and didn't do shit with it. Regardless of who we selected with those picks, like make a trade or something. We have nothing to show for that fortune we stumbled upon https://twitter.com/adamschefter/status/1095034701402771456?s=21 https://twitter.com/chrisbhaynes/status/1095087613717864449?s=21 Sign me up https://twitter.com/dragonflyjonez/status/1095040855386263553?s=21 ? Loving these KD tweets. Too accurate I agree with that Dubov. Still doesn't change the blown call tho That's like when coaches say "game wasn't lost on the last play". This is true, but doesn't change the fact that we shoulda won on that last play and lost as a result So you're saying we that didn't cost us the game? Idk how you can say that. We hit those 2 free throws it's a win Lol Dubov take your coaching hat off for a second. Both things are true. They played like shit and deserved to lose, yes. But that's irrelevant to the last play in a vacuum. It was one play to win the game and the refs blew the call aka costed us the game Correct! But it didn't. It happened on the last play of the game with the game on the line Time and situation Call it what you want but if they blow the whistle we win Sooooo PG for sure wasn't worth giving up CJ for huh Omg shut the fuck up hahaha that was so egregious Losing control of the ball only counts if someone on the opposing team tips/deflects it. Otherwise you could just "lose the ball" yourself on the way to the hoop every time and take a few more steps Right What a joke Trump ruined everything Lol you guys see this esquire controversy? They wrote a cover story on growing up as a 17 year white male in middle America lmao https://twitter.com/omaroneynba/status/1095390851595853826?s=21 Hot take maroney at it again! Completely made up durability question mark lol. Has Zion ever been injured Baron Davis / David Wesley was a fire nba jam combo Where do we think Meyers is a regular at Haha I heard Greg Oden was a fudruckers regular And he'd drive his Chevy avalanche on spinners ?Lillard > Steph Is there anyone who's a bigger fraud than Gary vee? That dude is a fucking clown He just pulled a Maroney in a rant against home ownership and said "sometime in the next 50 years, that shit is gonna get flipped on its head. Nobody will own" Really going out in a limb there dude! You won't even be alive to see that take through He's too busy doing podcast about nothing Telling kids not to go to school He said "93% of kids shouldn't go to college". Literally just made up that stat lol He's the trump of digital media Yeah Fuck fortnite They also stole the milly rock I used to love Bill Walker. He was so dope And James "flight" White Oh god. The last thing I needed this morning was joe Flacco coming to Denver I just read that Windy article about Lebron buying a team. Could he buy the Blazers? If we sell in 4-6 years like Canzano said, that would put the team for sale right when Lebron's playing career is ending I don't think he would. Too much pride And he doesn't need the money Other teams that could sell.. grizzlies? Suns? Maybe in a hostile takeover? I think he only owns like 25% ?Should I go see the IT return tonight Fucking kids. That generation is just a bunch of front runners None of them will be warrior fans in 5 years Nate Jones laid this out perfectly. It's the always connected, Netflix, espn era. Some white kid in Milwaukee can buy NBA league pass and watch every single warriors game. 

Back in the day most people grew up cheering for their local team cuz A. Their family had a strong tradition of fandom and B. It was the only team they could watch games of sans the random bulls game on ESPN So regional fandom doesn't really exist anymore Exactly Yeah but that's a different story. We don't cheer for our team just cuz we think they're gonna win. We cheer cuz it's our team I made that example for you Ian Brock that leads to a great example of kids wanting the easy way to everything. Cheering for a team that fucking sucks but it's your team, makes victory so much sweeter. It's the struggle to get there But that's represented in the job market too. All these spoiled fucks want this cushy 6 figure job with catered lunch right outta college. They don't wanna grind to get that But the whole reason people started cheering for a team is it's their local team I didn't start following the blazers cuz I thought we could win it all Dude it's all regional pride idk what you're talking about Obviously the hope to win is there But I literally followed the team cuz I lived there and always will becuz of that I mean that's the argument I'm making Brock. Because of Instagram and the internet these soft kids just follow winners But in the past it was never a question as to who to root for. Your local team Why the fuck are people browns fans? Cuz they live in Cleveland Omg realism isn't why your cheer for teams tho lol I know the blazers will likely never win another ship. I'll still watch every game Jameer Nelson def took HGH Bunky is spot on They should make an expansion team in Seattle and only let teams protect 4 players. Break the warriors up "Given not earned" He's the PG version of Sam Bowie Caused us to pass on CP3 Omg Kanter! https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1095801612671614977?s=21 Bye bye Meyers We don't play D anyways. Might as well get more offense https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1095803519326654464?s=21 God Woj is just jerking Neil off right now. Fuck those guys Too bad our top 10 pick can't even crack the top 8 lol New dame bio freeze ad is kinda dope Reason #712 Paul pierce shouldn't be on TV. He said steph curry is a "wing" Dude it's so bad. It makes me cringe every time Not only are the takes awful, his delivery isn't even good https://twitter.com/kayvont8/status/1095847412881477633?s=21 ?? Hopefully they promote Joe S to d coordinator https://twitter.com/tysonalger/status/1095839287298277377?s=21 Gotta hedge your bets Brock lol Say both things are going to be true Alright let's get this fucking win They were even yesterday for some odd reason Where's Kanter? He's not suiting up yet? Regarding our convo earlier today: all these cheers when Curry scores is making me sick Jordan bell just D'd up Lillard on the perimeter That'd be nice to have Hahaha Lillard didn't wanna fuck his percentage up at the buzzer Drops off a grenade to Layman The one downside of analytics https://twitter.com/highkin/status/1095871509736747008?s=21 What a fucking rookie. Who does this guy think he is I love that they're dragging Pierce right now lmao Props to Klay for actually shooting that Terry is fucking killing me with these rotations. I still don't know why Lillard closes out the 3rd every game He should follow Kerr's lead. He pulls curry with 2 minutes left in the 3rd then puts him back in with 8 minutes in the 4th Terry has no fucking clue what he's doing He's like drunk coked out Denzel in flight. Just pushing buttons Simons back door alley oop Flagrant Omg Kerr hahaha Yeah wtf Was that an accident Shut up mark I'm glad we have CJ Paul George McCollum riding the pine right now in crunch time White flag has been waved Omg Lillard Cum my pants Did Layman drop all 17 in the second half? ?? Simons dunk fest please I fucks wit layman Meyers is a fucking robot. He couldn't sell Raymond Felton a voodoo donut Do you not get ejected with 1 T and 1 flagrant? Does it have to be 2 of one of them or a flagrant 2? https://twitter.com/sreekyshooter/status/1095943895542710274?s=21 Lol how tf did the Suns not take Luka. Especially since they have his old coach Someone made a good point yesterday, the suns have Devin Booker they're paying $30 mil a year, last years #1 and #10 picks, and 2017's #4 pick and they have less wins than the Cavs whom have who exactly Lmao literally a team of g leaguers and outcasts Holy shit that was the greatest thing I've ever read haha https://twitter.com/jonesonthenba/status/1096111461825277952?s=21 PREACH! Lol Gundy do it for the people Fair weather fan. Why didn't he switch that allegiance when they were winless lol Lebron and drake are one in the same Wait he actually got a bio freeze tattoo? Lmao That's fucking awesome I hope it's a new one Something controversial ? https://twitter.com/shamscharania/status/1096164892057522176?s=21 https://twitter.com/enes_kanter/status/1096156231117418496?s=21 Lol that sporting goods store is in Colorado. I'm gonna go in this weekend and ask for a Kap Jersey Why didn't Demps just take the lakers offer lol That was a great fucking offer. They're letting their emotions get in the way of sound business Ball
Holiday
Ingram
Kuzma
Randle

With 2 unprotected lakers firsts coming is a pretty good salvage of the situation Yeah Ainge ain't trading Tatum. Especially if Kyrie leaves. They'll go all in on the young guys. Then it'll only be the lakers left and they'll have all the leverage You think Tatum alone is better than the lakers offer? Or same offer but swap Horford for Hayward It's the same as dealing with bellicheck. You don't do it. If they agree to it you're clearly getting fucked Yeah Ainge was whispering sweet nothings in Demps ear and it worked. He'll have amnesia come July But if the Celtics won't do Tatum, the deal is trash. Then NO comes crawling back to the Lakers and the leverage switches Magic could be like yeah the picks are off the table now sorry. You can have all the young guys tho Eh idk Dubov. That's a slippery slope It's a game of chicken at that point I don't think the lakers punt another offseason Does jimmy wanna play with lebron? Yeah his schtick wore out quick Can we s&t for him? Send ET back to the promise land. With Collins and Simons Dame, CJ, Jimmy, Kanter, Nurk would be kinda sick lol Just copped Blazers/Nuggets tickets April 5th! Lol blazers of course I'll be proudly rocking my letter O jersey I can't wait for Clay Travis to respond Do we think it's a real tat I like how his actual agent was in the commercial too lol. Along with Ricky jerret's boy from ballers Dude id get a real tat for a company if I had full sleeves why not https://twitter.com/timbontemps/status/1096802063315546112?s=21 ? I mean he doesn't really have to abide by any PC interview etiquette lol He already publicly told New Orleans to fuck off If gayle benson really won't trade with LA this could get interesting https://twitter.com/mcten/status/1096814566078640138?s=21 Lmao okay you're right Gundy Yeah what a mess Well he his a big wrestling fan so maybe more than we think Dubov I'm a big fan of these nike duck boots. Hope yall keep making em I thought Cnn just reported like an hour ago that it was a hoax ? His career is over Lmao good question Somebody get those dudes some bio freeze The one leg tear drop!! Yeah fuck Seth He's a blazer like Jamal Crawford is a blazer https://twitter.com/sheridanhoops/status/1096971078457585664?s=21 Lmao bigger troll than Steve Kyler https://www.instagram.com/p/Bt_pByXAw2b/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=15plqz1txzid5 Fucking pussy just brushed off help from a legend haha Dawg are you really hating on Anthony Hamilton Don't come at the goat like that Haha dude you need to broaden your musical tastes. He's a legend Listen to "Charlene" and say that again Lol you just said Anthony Hamilton should find another hobby Dubov it's okay if you don't listen to r&b ?Bring back east and west and bring back team jerseys Marks favorite rapper of all time! KD is such a try hard https://twitter.com/sreekyshooter/status/1097374463287472128?s=21 https://twitter.com/lindsaymills/status/1097606774687821824?s=21 Boom roasted ?Dylan, Kanter is gonna fit right in with the salem crowd wearing those rock n revivals lol He's just missing the Ed Hardy tee from Costco MJ, Zion, Kyrie, Grant Hill, James Worthy I'm with Ian. The guy is totally fucked. And we're certainly gonna see this a million times on Fox News in the next 2 years #NoTimeoutTerry Kanter Fever Sweeping the streets Everyone's gonna be wearing rock n revivals in no time Dubov you guys are so fucked No more duck boots for me Lol I'm being facetious Duck boots 4 lyfe The j rich baseline between the legs 180 dunk was the goat to me Had that poster all thru hs The fonz https://twitter.com/perrynbcboston/status/1098989562150469632?s=21 Someone took a video lmao My all time favorite movie I forgot about the popsicle pussy. Great call Double OT on ESPN PG MVP Is Jake Layman elite https://www.instagram.com/p/BuPJSixnQEt/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=1h83iv4isu1ws Lmao first team all shit talker I'm kinda down with it I thought it was all a mirage at first ?Idk why this is so funny but Steve Kerr got some terrible peripheral vision Talk about delayed reaction time Warriors with 5 all stars can't be Houston with 1 lmao ?Lol Lebron talking about urgency from the jump when he just said he's finally "playoff activated" in game 58 ?? https://twitter.com/ruleyork/status/1099572957469396992?s=21 Ja thinks he's Lil B now lmao I missed the 3rd quarter and were only up 6? Wtf happened 44-21 in the 2nd half?! Could the lakers actually miss the playoffs? Missing the playoffs would put the nail in the coffin of lebrons goat argument Late to the party here but yes Mark Glory Road is fantastic. White men can't jump and love and basketball are top 2 for me tho Only because mark wahlberg hasn't made a basketball movie yet Fun fact about white men can't jump: Keanu Reeves was originally cast as Billy Hoyle, but then they realized he fucking sucked at basketball and Woody got the call Yeah apparently he couldn't even fake a good jump shot ? Yeah what this chat isn't good enough for you Dubov? Does the other chat offer full analytics of conversations? I don't think so Hahahahaha wait what Can Elway renege on the Flacco deal and sign Foles? The trade can't be official til March Draymond is washed Jake > Hayward Hahaha I couldn't read that with a straight face God dammit ?At least our social team is funny Or we snag the 3 seed Absolutely ? Can he catch? Bet mark davis takes him first round Let's see that bumble match tho Bron losing to the suns now ?? He's hoopin! https://youtu.be/6CqXgs-7ico Totally agree Clay AB is on some crazy drugs the way he acting That's fucking amazing Jesus Christ I'm upset. Can't take games for granted! Yeah 5-2 is fucking great. But... we shoulda been 6-1 That's a bad loss Yeah but that's all in the past. We won those and had one game in front of us to finish 6-1. Can't piss away those games Yeah lol and we blew it I'm just saying you can't win a bunch in a row then say ah it's chill if we lose. We shouldn't have won those others That's how you become an average team No shit And you're satisfied That's a terrible mentality You just said it's cool we lost that game cuz we finished 5-2 Nah I feel that lol. Before the trip I would have been stoked with 5-2. But expectations change as games are completed. Once we're 5-1, that's behind us. You have one game in a vacuum against a bottom 5 team and you lose, which cancels out a win you had over a good team like the Celtics Just saying that's how good teams set themselves apart. Once you're playing with house money you still have to beat the teams you should beat, or the past big wins were for nothing And I feel like the blazers do that a lot. We win huge games against good teams, then lose against shitty teams and end up .500 Lol yes it does If you have one team in front of you, beat them It was 0-0 to start the game There isn't some statistical force up against the blazers that they had to lose tonight to regress to the mean Yeah they were at full strength against a bad team. Good teams win those games is all I'm saying That's not what I'm saying at all. But once we're sitting at 5-1 playing a shit team, your expectations shouldn't be "well I woulda been stoked if we went 5-2 beforehand so stats say we can drop this game and be happy" 5-2 assumes we beat the grizzlies and lose to the raptors and Celtics. We beat the Celtics so you have to beat the shitty teams to make that win worth it https://twitter.com/thedailyshow/status/1090749256628088833?s=21 Late to the party but this is fucking hilarious Apparently he called Tim Cook, "Tim Apple" today Lebron nervous af lmao https://www.instagram.com/p/BuupxApAuEa/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=10l0ugjn4pkkx I don't wanna play Houston in the playoffs lol no thank you Utah or San Antonio He thinks he's Tim hardaway when he's got the ball in his hands I cringe every time he dribbles Nurk getting in Westbrook's head lmao Clearly stuck his foot out I love it Gamesmanship baby Wow Technical on Nurk! Good officiating on that tbh tho God Lillard is unreal When he gets downhill after splitting the pick n roll he's unstoppable https://twitter.com/fantasypros/status/1103880013139476481?s=21 AB gonna EAT next year Wowowow Kenny has Portland in the WCF Charles saying finals now Cuz of Rodney hood and Kanter lmao I love it This is like a championship for me. All I want is recognition!! Me too, cam. Me too Gotta change my shorts before the 2nd half starts It's glorious It's kinda like when Hayden was listed top 10 in the Sigep sexy list. We all knew it wasn't true but he loved the recognition I wonder if Rovell has the scoop on sketchers stock after chuck said it was trash Where's Nurk rank amongst Centers now? He's gotta be above Steven Adams now yeah? You're taking Nurk over Gobert and Towns?! Yeah Olshey is a cocksucker but he deserves credit for Nurk at 12 mil I can listen to these dudes for hours. Isiah Thomas is an immediate mute When are we gonna put Meyers in to close this out ? What the fucking fuck Wish that 13 guy was in black and red Terry is drawing up the ATO for a Meyers 3 ball as we speak Is Nurk gone?! We getta pick the shooter now? I think it's gotta be someone off the bench Meyers! This is so dumb. The Nurk trip should have been a flagrant Billy is picking Layman. Little does he know Jake has a 10 inch hog and ice water in his veins Omg Anyone on the bench Jesus Christ Cut this guy Jordan bell would've made it Omg 2 more!!! Morris karma for pulling on Curry's shorts back in December How is Aminu 85% and fucking cold blooded lmao I love this game PG is getting the shot Aminu better D the fuck up Shut up!!! Dame time! This is destiny Fuck I hate to say it guys, but we're gonna get some Meyers in OT NyQuil is the real deal man Hahahaha cam Fuck outta here. Late call Agreed Kanter is useless right now God CJ is anti clutch Has he ever made a big shot? Welp Fuck this Yeah Dubov remember that loss We'd be tied with OKC right now if we won Gotta win the gimmes! ?This is a gimme ?Dame is a couple 50 pieces away from rarified air https://twitter.com/baysean/status/1103891615993614337?s=21 3.5 whites is never good ?Denver loves Davis on that good good Trade that other first for Odell Lol klay calling out warriors fans is great https://twitter.com/dimeuproxx/status/1104959846162427904?s=21 He purposely won't wear anything Dubov sends him Crowder getting paid too Classic jets move Lol Marques Chriss just saw his life flash before his eyes The maroney hedge truly is a beautiful thing.

This is great. What's the odds on this guy getting banned from the arena for life? Silver's gonna launch a full on investigation I heard that MAGA tweet may be photoshopped Yeah but people can spin up fake tweets just as fast ?This one I'm pretty sure is real tho https://twitter.com/derikstevenson/status/990105426191532033?s=21 Here's the real tweet that Shane replied to too But yeah MAGA hoax again The Jemele Hill one? She deleted it I think that video was fake ?Look at his followers and following. Fake account ?This is the real one 51 following He's not following 1,000 like that video everyone is posting Y'all gotta be more pessimistic when evaluating this stuff lol ?Everyone is trying to dox his employer and now Utah DPS is on damage control for a employee from 6 years ago Lol The internet is cray Oh 100%. Russ really has no incentive to lie But all the misinformation and attempts by people to fit their narrative just cracks me up That's a good point space. I guess I'm jumping to the conclusion that I assume Russ wouldn't freak out like that over nothing. Which I think is accurate But he definitely could be embellishing it a bit since he got caught on camera saying that. So he has to justify it But all in all I feel like the dude def said some racist shit and Russ is in the right I don't wanna speculate and wave the MAGA flame more.. but Westbrook said the guy said "get on your knees like you used to".. which is clearly a slavery reference. And why Russ said it was a "racial comment" If it's "get on your knees like you're used to" that's just emasculating but not as bad Called it LaMarcus really fucked that one up didn't he Could have been the all time leading scorer for Portland. Franchise favorite Let's go. That's fucking dope They should grab Leveon while they're at it LSU gang They're boys I'm talking bout jarvis and Odell mark Yeah leveon was Michigan st Yeah Odell is way younger than AB. He was always gonna demand more. Browns don't want a bunch more 22 year olds anyway Him and Baker are gonna be sick I'd rather pay a top receiver than a top rb ?Didnt realize he has a deescalating deal too Agreed Dylan Or have a veteran QB who's willing to take 10 mil a year so you can fill out the roster Yeah. Or any other smart vets https://www.instagram.com/p/Bu7XWG4FpyL/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=1cpizx8anynwr Steelers shoulda traded AB for Rosen Truuuuu Yeah Dylan's right. It's all the guaranteed money NY had to pay. There's some rule about spreading that over the first couple years of the deal so you can't just give someone a massive signing bonus then small cap hits in following years https://twitter.com/covers_vegas/status/1105628701956272129?s=21 I think the Steelers have the largest dead money cap hit in nfl history after the AB trade I agree dehaan Has field yates never seen that meme lol Wow Doncic is pulling a LeBron. 1-9 at the line tonight Why does Nurk keep wearing yellow shoes all the sudden Lol oh boy. Bad move for him. LT 2.0 Damn dame ain't gonna pass LA in LA Still got a good shot at 50 wins too CJ showcasing himself for that summer trade too. I love it Pop would have to retire for them to do that CJ for AD tho let's make it happen Could happen! ? We'll channel some 2011 Mavs vibes with Dame in his downward prime and a bunch of old wiley fucks If Meyers logs more seasons as a blazer than terry porter I'm turning in my fan card Kids will look back in 20 years like damn who was that legend Meyers Leonard? 15 seasons with Portland? He must have been a beast! Gunz I think we can speak that into reality We just need our Rasheed Wallace mid season trade Who's gonna be that X factor God you're getting me horny This is how we convince ourselves to watch another season Dylan There's always a chance! Space can suck my dick cuz that heat team is hot garbage "Guys James Johnson is really turning the corner!" "Olynyk is an underrated finisher at the rim!" Idk if LA has the balls to go that hard at a trade request I'm cooling a bit on the Kevin Love idea Blake would be epic Hell no He wouldn't require CJ Jimmy S&T https://twitter.com/denverpost/status/1105806692682551296?s=21 If you guys don't hear from me tomorrow, the bomb cyclone got me Good thing I got my Nike duck boots lol I'm now getting thunder and snow. Don't get that combo too often ?Looking pretty warm out there ?Not at all actually. This was red rocks last weekend. I love it out here Snoop dogg is playing red rocks on 4/20 this year But seriously if anyone wants to hit red rocks this summer you got a free place to stay Oh baby. It is v centrally located Damn New Orleans is breaking up the Ingram/Kamara duo For real. That was a fucking beastly duo Ingram is way better than Latavius imo Truuuu https://twitter.com/bball_ref/status/1105907713018642438?s=21 Jesus Christ for real? That's big time His passing has improved a ton this year 25/5 is a pretty round number benchmark tho It's like 20/10 for a big man They left off the fact that he's averaging the most assists in nba history on Tuesday night road games. Big if true Yeah that's totally fair. The 4 in 7 is kinda cherry picked He was #BornReady Houman that's the smartest thing you've ever said I don't believe in stotts either unfortunately. Guy makes zero adjustments when things go wrong The first time he lets a 16-0 run rattle off without calling a timeout im going to break my tv Brock I remember this argument vividly lol. That you don't believe in momentum in sports Show me the stats cuz I beg to differ I'm gonna sound real get off my lawn here, but I don't think momentum and the hot hand can accurately be quantified The hot hand is most definitely real I didn't realize how close the west got. Houston could grab the 1 seed ?And Denver has murderers row the last 10 games ?Dubov you should apply! Nice pickup The hot hand! Beto's gonna bring it home I bet you at least 5 more democrats announce haha When are people gonna realize how fucking bad sports proposals are ?Please tell me how this man pulled Rosario Dawson I mean he gives some pretty passionate senate debates but cmon https://twitter.com/omaroneynba/status/1106337487272607747?s=21 #MaroneyFlex Stromile Swift was one of the OG uber athletic 4's He was a boss A whole dollar Lol I love that BWW is using bob menery for all their March madness commercials What size jacket is that? 60L?

I wonder if it's worth anything ?15/16 day one Lemme get northern Kentucky +13 mark ?Zach Lowe is raving about John Collins and it's just making me depressed. Can you imagine Zach Collins ever making a move like this On the bright side, Nurk is sneakily putting up the same averages from Nurk Fever but over an entire season and in less playing time ? Right? Except better FT%, less Turnovers and all in less minutes I feel like Terry should give him 30mpg tho Just got tickets to Dave chappelle / Jon Stewart at red rocks let's go I feel like an asshole tho cuz my buddy goes "dude Dave chappelle goes on sale in 2 minutes you should get some". He'd been in the waiting room for 15 minutes. Of course I get them and he doesn't haha Sorry pal You can cut the tension with a knife right now God cincy just fucked me Bobby Hurley's old team. He's got their number Gimme back door cover or gimme death I've never cheered so hard for a fat white boy shooting a 3 down 15 at the buzzer Mark and I both in 2nd in the big boy group Lmao the guy in 1st place in Rengel's group didn't fill out a Champion. So he's only got 156 possible points left Jesus Christ gundy You just went for anarchy Hahahahaha shut up Glad we locked him for a few more years Holy shit I just read that whole story haha. Lavar is as dumb as well thought ?Lavar got this email from their financial advisor in October. What was his response? Fired the financial advisor, then apparently did read the entire email until a couple weeks ago because a reporter asked Lonzo if they knew their business partner served 7 years in prison for running a Lonzo scheme. Lonzo had no idea lmao Ponzi scheme** I think if I got an email that said "urgent $1.5 million dollars missing".. I would read the email He served 7 years in jail for financial fraud and money laundering!! How dumb can they be haha They might as well hire Billy McFarland to be their CFO Dude they're already using Foster as a cop out. Lavar said it was fosters idea to make their own shoe and not sign with Nike Fucking idiots Haha gundy don't make excuses. He's not built for school? Matt those both have me dying ???? I can't wait for the American Greed episode Idk that just seems lazy. What is he built for then? Doing nothing like he is now? Seems like bad fathering to me tbh Well I don't want to work but I need to make money. Sounds like he's just lazy af lol Idk man. I've been with Ian on the Lavar is ruining his children and this is gonna end badly train Well so far they've all sucked D Lo > Lonzo I do like his defense but what's he doing outside of that. Will you at least agree his shooting prowess was a farce? He shot good from 3 in college for one season and everyone thought he was the second coming of steph Ignoring his poor FT% which is often indicative of overall shooting ability ?Tacko Cam Juarez Fall https://twitter.com/betmybookie/status/1108028904575561728?s=21 Lol ?Daily update Of course not But I'm in first now so y'all can SMDFTB Where's the fun if there's no shit talking ya know Gotta go Pac 12 man Except ASU cuz they were clearly trash Thanks for clarifying what moved mark Thought you were getting excited about the bbq The rule is pac 12.. unless they suck Plus it coincided with my other rule, don't pick Mormon teams Touch The ol 12/5 upset works every time Another rule of mine No Mormons, pac 12, 12 seeds, Bernie voters That's how I make my picks They're the same bracket Or conflicted https://www.instagram.com/p/BvVV6f8nS7B/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=ygytu4gzajj5 Is this real Wow https://twitter.com/albertbreer/status/1109251477661454336?s=21 What a terrible take Lemme rephrase that for you "I didn't watch any basketball until last week.

Ride the beast! Wtf You gotta be kidding Why basketball gods!!!! Wes part 2 Was that Hayward level bad? https://twitter.com/pinwheelempire/status/1110404856525680640?s=21 I've never felt anything like that tweet Nurks looks just like PG's Shin area Hayward was ankle Didn't see that coming This is unreal So we're not gonna get Nurk back til 2020-2021 Yeah this has gotta be like 18 months minimum Especially with his size and weight So twitter doctors are telling me he may never come back Where's Houman when you need him Yeah I feel like I'm just gonna have to accept that nurkic is never gonna play for us again And hope for the best Idk man I just don't wanna get my hopes up That's a lot of weight on that leg Look how long Livingston took to come back I legit felt with the right matchups we could have made the WCF this year And fuck you ian before you call me a homer Watch us win a playoff series on pure will That'd be a very dame story line So is terry gonna start Zach and give him 30 minutes a night? Time to see what he can do Did I have a spicy take? I mean I hope he gets close to that. No reason not to That dudes trash Don't waste minutes on him Yeah he already spoke on camera professing his innocence They said they aren't charging him cuz he already did community service Devin booker is a fraud I'm with you space I can say whatever I want with certainty Doesn't make it true But I'm sure certain But nah I actually am in the camp that his stats are overinflated and he doesn't contribute to winning If he's that good, him and Ayton should get more wins than they have Yeah that's exactly the point Dubov. His stats are great but what has it done for them They have way more talent than 17 wins Mavs yes grizzlies debatable I'm not saying they're a playoff team but if Booker is so special and Ayton is really good. They should be better than historically bad Look Dubov I think Booker is great, just don't be surprised if he's also bad Space that was a maroney reference if you missed it I no longer make lukewarm takes after you roasted me for the Lavar ball thing Did you guys hear they may fold big baller brand altogether? Seems that way but idk for sure https://twitter.com/danegado/status/1110597510232305664?s=21 Why's he putting this kinda expectations on our boy cmon I don't think every team takes Lonzo 2nd. Which is why they traded him Also they probably could have got more than salary dumping mozgov and a late first. They got lucky with Kuzma there Nobody doing it with blocks! *hassan whiteside voice* https://twitter.com/ericg_nba/status/1110952957351215104?s=21 I like this. Get them 50 wins and get big fella paid How is Portland only -400 ML with the entire bulls roster out Bout to put my 401k on that https://twitter.com/g0negirlll/status/1110968428100288513?s=21 In today's trying too hard segment ?Salem's own getting air time on Countdown Salem Academy high school https://twitter.com/omaroneynba/status/1111085393745575937?s=21 Reporter maroney in his stubhub purchased seats That was the easiest -400 ever I only had 50 bucks left in my account. The rest is on ducks +8 Mark you should have had the Apple credit card Holy fuck if you haven't read the replies to that Switzer tweet. I'm dying I'm with you big dawg Wow Ben coming in from the top rope Damn windy coming with the hot takes today RB's got no market these days ?Monarch Mack holy shit Tennessee finally woke up Admiral Schofield is a great tourney name Give it to admiral! Wow! Haven't seen this bad of free throw shooting since '08 Memphis These games are both shootouts Louie!! Dylan you're right. It's definitely dick size Pritchard is probably 4 inches hard Truuuu me too Imagine Bol on this squad 4 ill advised threes in a row smh God dammit Those last 4 possessions killed us. Should have been a foul on that last 3 tho At least I won some money But shit man https://twitter.com/realgm/status/1111677968366141440?s=21 CJ for Beal https://www.instagram.com/p/BvmfGsWHNZN/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=nvcnzl3tigka First time I've ever cashed out ahead on Bovada. It feels good Even tho it was all ducks +8 blood money https://www.instagram.com/p/BvmJNAIj-nA/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=cfqs7mxdd2sy Kuzma hating in the comments but that's not even a weird stat Blake been killing it No way CJ and pieces yes. Nurk is a top 5 center now. May be more valuable than CJ Blake stretches the floor now. They'd both work Jokic 
Embiid
Towns
Gobert
Nurkic Are my top 5 ?I realize this is one stat but he's in that group for sure Do what straight up space? Agreed Brock. CJ and picks is just as good as Tobias and avery It's an RPM list I qualified it with I know this is just one stat Yeah the contract makes him even that much better. All those other guys are making twice what he is Lol dude Ian I think you're way overrating Drummond The numbers are good yes but he's not that great of a defender. I'm pretty sure Detroit was looking to dump him at the deadline cuz he's not worth that contract I'd still have him top 10 center for sure but he's not a world beater He's great but don't be surprised if he's sucks is what I'm saying ? Grizzlies picked Jonas over Drummond from the sounds of it Dame 50 piece tonight? Watching the real Collins of 2017 hit corner 3's ?? Fuck KD And fuck bob Fitzgerald Cry baby Steph Couple good games tonight ?Never gets old https://twitter.com/sheridanhoops/status/1112005372586459136?s=21 Oliver's dad? Is that you? https://twitter.com/thewarriorstalk/status/1112080836063453184?s=21 Is this intentional? Seems like he was tryna hit the breaks more than anything Such fucking cry baby's over there in the bay Wow that's amazing Omg That was incredible I feel bad for jinxing my buddy +6 in the 4th Shut up Dubov you dawg I'm with you mark. Make sure they read it Is this calipari lifetime extension and April fool's joke? Damn our defense is legit with Kanter at C Layman is the anti Harkless Brock I left out the second part of my prediction. "... or it might be worth nothing too. Just saying it could go up" But hey 2019 is the year boys. It's going to the moon! Take out that 2nd mortgage No way the new Wizards GM gives Brad Beal a supermax with Wall still on the books right? Trade coming? https://www.instagram.com/p/BvxXcnmF1F1/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=1mmilihkxqrtb What is going on over here 50 wins here we come God it must suck to be a heat fan So glad I cheer for a winning team Fully guaranteed?! Damn I didn't realize Kirk got his fully guaranteed. That's wild Aaron Rodgers got $103 million guaranteed. That's the bar to top So if we go 4-0 and beat the nuggets twice. We could still get the 2 seed? Exactly Dubov. You're finally getting it Every win matters One win against the damn grizzlies standing in our way of a 2 seed. What a shame https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1113862077842640898?s=21 I thought this was from a parody account at first lmao Definitely a Brad ?I thought I was coming to a football game what is this It's been number 1 on Apple Music for a few weeks Ya boi gonna be there ?Enemy territory I'm also 6 drinks deep Dude hair plugs are coming 2020. Wait on it Dawg I'm row 8 behind the blazers bench. Look for someone getting rowdy on the refs ?Wassup Thrill ?Our boys Didn't Gundy dub him the peoples champ?? Yeah it was supposed to be 8 then they bumped it back for tv Really fucked up my pre game drinking schedule ?MVP Lmao Look at the angle. Good seats ?"Holy shit. I think I forgot my Portland gear tee" 8 years as a blazer. Almost the same as terry porter How is dame scoreless Wow Usually I'd say let the boys play but that's definitely a foul We should get 50% off all duckboots Is anyone taking him up on that? Make a JCSL duck boot run and we'll all Venmo 100% Superliga round table Jokic, Murray and Milsap are all resting I got you for all the nuggets news guys don't worry ?Lol https://www.instagram.com/p/Bv9iHW4Amf9/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=1djaabgizmtvf Bring back the one leg sleeve Clyde is real bad They're worse than the warriors team and bob Fitzgerald is about as bad as it gets so that's saying something Dude you're telling me you didn't wanna offer your take on Pierce saying he's better than d wade lmao I hate the warriors but the jerseys tonight are pretty fire Still up in the air. We got a chance at the 3 seed if we win tonight Two dame facts for the night. 18 assists in the next 2 games and he averages 7.0 assists for the first time in his career. And he just passed Lamarcus for 3rd all time in blazers career win shares ?Look at the caption lmaooo https://twitter.com/sam_amick/status/1115261334625460224?s=21 Gundy can you bypass this paywall for us? God you're a fucking saint gundy Don't you hate those journalists trying to make a buck Thibs and Boylen overwhelming least favorite coaches lmao Also everyone saying Durant is gone is interesting https://www.instagram.com/p/BwAPQFxhIcz/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=10zmyti5vcgkd Is AB on drugs? Dude is acting like a lunatic. He's going full TO in the driveway Guy seems like a cancer Somebody hit him with a dead dog joke please Dogs name was Bella I'm pretty sure Lol Meyers is on Cameo now. First of all who the fuck is paying him $25 for a video when you can get the sexy Kristen ledlow for the same price Second, what funny shit could we request him to say PSA: if anyone wears an 11.5, Nordstrom rack has the official JCSL green/orange/black nike duck boot for $89 right now Jesus that's awful God Donovan Mitchell is gonna fuck us in the ass Lol who's third? CJ? Whoa whoa that's a fuego take my man Tyreke not jingles Am I crazy to think Dame v Curry should be a conversation for the other 1st team guard spot this year? Dame is better than Curry in VORP, Win Shares and BPM And their per game stats are almost identical Then consider what dame is working with and we've only won 3 less games 100% And PG over Durant PG was unreal this year But then I realize how dumb fans are when everyone in those comments is saying Russ should get first team lol Post injury? Hasn't he played like 78 games this year I mean he's no billy king that's for sure. Could be worse. The main issues are 

1. He's too arrogant to admit when he's wrong and course correct
2. He uses the "small market can't take risks" excuse to not go after any available all stars during unprecedented player movement 
3. The 2017 draft was a total failure. Had 3 1sts in a deep draft and he fucked us Also if you wanna play devils advocate on the draft. Dame was the pretty obvious choice at the time, and he picked CJ over Giannis. The latter nobody really saw coming but still Heating up! Well got damn We got a game That's so ridiculous. Replay overkill Virginia knocked it out Space with the hipster take So does this mean we could have won the championship? I'll give you that space Happy birthday brotha! What if we get the 3 and play the Spurs? Or would y'all rather play the jazz Donovan Michael Jordan Mitchell just scares me ya know If the Thunder beat Houston then lose, San Antonio beats Dallas, and we win out.. we play the spurs as the 3rd seed But most likely we play the Jazz as the 4 seed like gunz said This is hilarious What a shitty tenure So are Walton and Rob Lowe gone too? Oh god mark. That could definitely happen How weird would it be if we were sad Olshey left Rich Cho was so bad hahaha I just can't wait til Lebron buys the blazers in 4 years Rich Paul as GM Hold up j crossover had 51 off the bench tonight?

Start Simons God everyone wrote us off after the pelicans sweep and here we are with the fucking 3 seed again bitches!!! Suck my dick spaceman Lol spaceman spaceman spaceman Literally everyone wrote us off what are you talking about ESPN picked us 10th in the west pre season Nba twitter called Jrue dames daddy and said we were hot garbage Literally espn writers did Who else do you want FOH ?Nobody said we'd miss the playoffs??? Suck my fucking dick Don't back track now space!! Don't do it They said we were a lottery team! Lol They projected 43 wins we won 53 Hmm seems like I heard that last year when we got the 3 seed Then we did it again This team is riding destiny Nurk's gonna trip Westbrook with his crutch from the sideline in game 3 This is the equivalent of a championship for blazers fans lol Except when you tell us we can't trade CJ for AD Gotta make fun of Meyers dog ?Final Dame v. Curry comparison Sounds like me with duck boots It's snowing here today so I wore mine and sold my manager on em. He just bought a pair If only I could sell software that easily ? Gotta selfie for the gram with him I mean Snapchat What'd I miss with that tweet Hmm I didn't read it like that at all. He was welcoming him to the club True but he didn't get traded so don't count lol Idk I also love everything Kobe does now. Which is funny cuz I never hated a player more when he was playing Lol wait space what does that have to do with the player staying with 1 team I think it's pretty cool in hoops when you've only played for one squad If anything that's even more of a testament to the player for not getting shipped off for cap room Yeah I mean that part was kinda lame and self serving I agree But playing for one franchise your entire career is pretty cool in general For sure I agree with that But it does say that your talents were high enough that they never wanted to trade you. Which says something about your skills https://twitter.com/ballislife/status/1116308361484615680?s=21 https://twitter.com/nateduncannba/status/1116388822370013184?s=21 Okay dude he won 5 rings That's what we call trying to create a take when one ain't there https://www.instagram.com/p/BwIE8OulHti/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=qk2ky38of9y4 Where's Zach Collins?

Jarrett Allen would look real nice starting for us with Nurk out What's hilarious is we traded into the lottery to draft a backup to Nurkic when we had hope solo sized holes at the 3 & 4. Then Nurk goes down two years later and ZC isn't even ready to step in for him lol Adams would physically abuse Zach tho ?Me typing that text Brock Wowwwwww Vlade So who does that leave with coaching openings? Cavs Lakers and Grizzlies? Mark when did you become a pit master Good shit man Is that marky mark Best actor alive Raise your hand if you're drunk God I remember going to burgerville with gundy and Dylan after spaceman's 21er Good times Sooo is Montrez faried 2.0 Or is this dude legit Big montrez fan now Fuck the snake I hate KD more than I love Donavon Mitchell God KD is the most fake tough guy ever Fuck You if you like him.

I instantly regret that I'm sure mr Holmes is a saint I'm fucking dying hahaha Shut up Omg this guy is like an urban legend He has to be trolling us I need a warriors dumpster fire in my life KD gonna walk out on the team I love it. Pass the torch bron I've just resigned to the fact Portland will never get their shine hiding in the PNW Half the country doesn't even know where Oregon is And goes to sleep before our games start I completely agree. But I'm just saying there's more eyeballs on them than Portland will ever have And paying in the central time zone lol Yeah no doubt. Success on the court is all that matters at the end of the day I'm just saying less people notice what the blazers are doing. But yeah the bucks have crushed almost every move Snagging Brogdon and Middleton in the 2nd round. Getting Bledsoe for basically nothing Lopez for the minimum https://twitter.com/nfl/status/1118102315234463745?s=21 Dehaan you were right.

In no particular order I'd swap PG and Westbrook space He's better than Russ Also Dame is better than Russ and Kyrie I think it's close but I'm biased. I think Dame is hands down better than kyrie tho All the kids just see uncle drew and think kyrie is god Yeah his handle is unreal Bring in Meyers! CJ has that old man slow mo crossover Olshey is already polishing his narrative. You think he loved the 3 seed last year? How bout back to back 3 seeds That buys him at least another 5 years! Smh someone gotta call Felton chasing Wtf was that clock management Thunder are hedging way harder on screens this game Good minutes from Zach tho! Let's go! Wtf is happening. That was a travel on Adams Can't stand up without dribbling when you're on your knees. Basketball 101 Omg That was the most slow mo charge ever 52-47 thunder 1 minute left in the 2nd Kevin Mchale is awful to listen to 3 on ferg Yeah cam if you're behind I apologize cuz Dylan and I are texting this shit live lol Haha !!!!!! What a fucking pass by Dame. God damn! He looked to the short corner mid air, which pulled the defender away and opened up CJ. That was filthy https://twitter.com/dimeuproxx/status/1118365991950540800?s=21 Omg I just came Dylan rack up another line! Lol Meyers going with the wax on wax off defensive stance Empty the baggy Dylan we ain't sleeping tonight!!! Usually I can't cum when I'm on coke but my pants are soaked rn Dame over Felton washing away all our sins!! ?? Without question. Dude is hyping himself up mid play over a routine rebound CJ > Jimmy Butler It's a low bar Clayton I'm loving all these GIF's Nurk is tweeting Meyers swung the momentum right Brock ?In Gundy's defense, there's one +/- outlier on the blazers bench... Lillard in full assassin mode right now 

Reporter: "what do you have to say to all those who left you for dead after Nurkic went down?"

Dame: "nothing" CJ fielding questions from all the heavy hitters right now; Kevin Pelton, Jason Quick, Erik Gunderson Dylan loves big lines ?I never thought I'd read these words in a millions years No way is AD coming back right??? Was it Jeannie or Magic? I haven't seen anything that egregious from her And yeah I saw others say that too Gundy. That she chose Kobe over magic. Cuz magic wanted to fire pelinka and she wouldn't allow it Okay well magic made all the idiotic signings and trades Then quit on a whim so he could tweet And I agree with space. I don't think people wanna play with Lebron https://www.instagram.com/p/BwWFfu8ASfD/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=1lzscffhpi10x Okay but I feel like a lot of this is hindsight comments. A lot of laker fans were hyped when magic was hired It's easy to say now that it was a dumb hire and he had no qualifications Yeah I mean she's not great. And she hired magic who was terrible. But don't act like there weren't people hyped on the magic hire But also the knicks have Jim Dolan so they ain't in the clear either lol He lost me at jee-anis Accurate How do we become instagram influencers Mark and I had a buddy in SF that became an influencer. Very small scale he's got like 35k followers but he makes like $5k a month And free clothes. Nice little side gig https://theathletic.com/930520/2019/04/18/happy-together-rodney-hood-has-rediscovered-his-love-for-the-game-with-the-trail-blazers/ Gundy you got a cliff notes version for us poors You're a saint wow Blocking my calendar 3pm-4pm God that was a great episode lol Meyers looking dumb af was v accurate https://twitter.com/cjmccollum/status/1119015583364919297?s=21 CJ approves God thanks for that reminder mark. That was an all timer I just rewatched the kings war room mark lol so good They had Vonleh rated 3rd in the draft Vivek makes the whole room say "Nik rocks!" On speakerphone after they picked him https://twitter.com/jakeweingarten/status/1118694870472896512?s=21 Where's he going?? ?In other news, mark and I love this game called salem Facebook statuses. Here's today's salem tweet Damn Westbrook off to another hot start ? Is Zach rolling to the wrong spots or are we just throwing shitty passes Wow that sounds awesome space. I haven't hit the slopes in months ? In San Francisco it was an every weekend endeavor Mark saw me in some dark places Meyers with the tiger fist pump after a 15 foot jumper lol Over Meyers just ran away from Adams in the pint Paint Wtf is Meyers arguing about?? That's a text book blocking foul lmao Dude is a head case Terrible call 10 turnovers in one quarter. Sweet Oh boy Dame time! Changed it The foul That was clutch Fuck that was in n out Cam ask if he wants to hit a key bump in the bathroom Meyers!!!! Got damn the fury Let's fucking go!!! Terry's gotta get dame back in This is too long Yeah it's unreal Gotta think some regression in the 4th is due Need me some bricks Fuck fuck fuck Grant > Aminu is the difference rn Russ gonna regret that cradle Cradle is past tense Rengel come on Cut the lead to 5 with 2 minutes and were in business Oh my bad haha Dame should have played the entire 4th. You don't sit a guy throwing flame balls in a virtual close out game Oof Wow Russ is talking so much shit lol Hey tmac scored 13 in 33 seconds we still got a chance 15-29 from three is absolutely absurd Wow that just fucked yalls backdoor cover chance I think I now hate Russ more than Harden Harden just flops. Russ is that shit talker everyone wants to punch in the face https://twitter.com/joesimonssays/status/1119453565708169217?s=21 This sums up my thoughts What's up with this Russ Barry Tramel beef? Okay I tracked down the Tramel v Westbrook beef timeline for y'all. 

It started in the 2014 Memphis series when Tramel wrote an article which mentioned Durant being "unreliable" from the FT line after missing 3 FT's in the 4th Q of a one point loss https://newsok.com/article/4744653/memphis-defense-has-knocked-kevin-durant-from-his-moorings? The Oklahoman then changed the front page title to "Mr. Unreliable" which Tramel had no knowledge of https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.si.com/nba/point-forward/2014/05/01/oklahoman-apologizes-calling-thunders-kevin-durant-mr-unreliable Durant took the high road and said the criticism was warranted anyway. But Russ called the story "BS" ? That was in May 2014. In January 2015 Russ tells Tramel he doesn't like him during an interview https://youtu.be/nawEqAz-8-s Then in the 2017 playoffs, Tramel asks Steven Adams why the Thunder have such a stark drop off in play when Russ is on the bench. Russ jumps in and goes on a rant about Tramel trying to sow discord between teammates and says "next question" https://twitter.com/mattravis/status/856280495277166592?s=21 Ever since, Russ answers every single Tramel question with "next question" Tramel wrote that he continues to ask Russ questions knowing he won't answer because he doesn't want Russ to feel like he can win, and block out the media from doing their job. But he says he likes Westbrook and doesn't understand the beef https://newsok.com/article/5627448/westbrooks-next-question-act-is-about-control Based on the facts, I'm going team Tramel here. The end https://twitter.com/notsportscenter/status/1119456143695392768?s=21 He bout to be backing up Eli Manning next year Andre Drummond with the slow mo close outs on Lopez https://www.instagram.com/p/Bwf7cWZgcFY/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=1227xccze9lc6 Fat Minnesota Kevin love > jacked Kevin love Does Scott still sleep 14 hours a day? Oh boy early Meyers minutes Why is Meyers already flexing We fouled em ZC! Meyers is killing us right now 24 second violation, bricked 3, gives up Morris open 3, late on rotation and Noel dunks Yeah he's distributing really well He'll get it rolling in the 2nd That was huge! 3rd foul on PG Wow Cam Cmon man This is a blazers chat We need to get some shooters in there. Has Crabbe played at all yet? CJ and Dame with an earlier than usual return Terry not fucking around Agreed Moe is killing us tho Yeah dame has been off. This might be the CJ show tonight Yeah why's he playing so passive Fuck yes Great end to the half Hahaha What's hilarious is Westbrook seems like he's on fire. I check the box score. 5-14 from the floor lol Inefficiency is in his blood PG didn't play the last 10 minutes of the half tho. We should go at him right away try to draw a quick 4th foul Dylan I hate to say it cuz I'm petty af, but yes Chuck saying we have the best bench in the nba is too much. I couldn't keep a straight face watching that one Or Westbrook now Easy money Grant and Aminu are literally the same player to me Heat check? Omg Dylan I finished The dame Easter night performance is gonna be a story told for ages No boogie Trade our best bench in the league for AD Aminu catapult 3's give me life ???????? Dylan you're so right on the over compensating media Gundy drop a "Notre Dame he's on fire joke" Fuck Really dumb foul by dame with 29 seconds left Haha god dammit mark that's too real Stotts might have to put dame back in at the 10 minute mark https://twitter.com/royceyoung/status/1120164956467548162?s=21 I'm not liking this S/O to you sticking up for the true Meyers haters mark We can't let pussys hang their hat on hating Meyers if they ain't gonna bring it Bailey is an important piece too. That's his brother who was in the military and makes Meyers think he's captain America Aminu against the clippers in 2016 was a beast Swanigan provided a key spark off the bench True story, jerami grant has never shot a contested 3 in his life Fuck that's 5 On dame https://twitter.com/nilamadison/status/1120170829344411648?s=21 Lol at Donovan hiding Westbrook on Harkless Shit CJ called it. But Terry could have been yelling it Lmao Westbrook a complete non factor in the 2nd half. 1 point on 0-7 shooting Can't wait for Tramel's first question post game That shit is must see tv https://twitter.com/bosnianbeast27/status/1120175251562696705?s=21 Next question lol https://twitter.com/money23green/status/63449644105072640?s=21 ?If you watch the post game cut up with no volume, you'd think Portland lost lol I need a Portland Denver round 2 matchup from the basketball gods https://twitter.com/zlics/status/1120175338791800832?s=21 Russ and PG went a combined 13-42 from the floor Westbrook left for the locker room before the game ended lmao https://twitter.com/sportstalkbarry/status/1120181503395233793?s=21 Holy shit Tramel on the mic! ? https://twitter.com/hoopsxtroll/status/1120190923936272384?s=21 Russ needs to channel throwback chuck https://twitter.com/ray_gtt/status/1120293281533968389?s=21 I love reading OKC fan takes What's everyone's thoughts on the Kate Smith drama Some singer from the 1930's.

Maybe for QB's but that's it https://twitter.com/the_coleanthony/status/1119418005560029184?s=21 Who knows! Hopefully his pops told him how awesome Portland was I actually remember when he was born I think it was during the WCF against the Lakers https://twitter.com/complexsports/status/1120487713306763267?s=21 First Bucks playoff win since Ray Allen and the big dawg led Milwaukee in scoring https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1120548606392639488?s=21 Lmao what is going on out there ?5 coaches in 6 years.

He's gonna have to sit for awhile This is the first time I've seen Dame start the 2nd Yes it is He's feeling it They'll regress. They can't keep this shooting up Guys we're witnessing history Dubov I'm so jealous you're there Lol this is Kobe 81 point game type shit He ain't passing the ball No reason to And two of those he just flung up to draw a foul So is dame gonna play all 48?

No Russ??? Lmao Lmao PG just said "I don't care what anyone says, that was a bad shot" Bitter af Guys. I kinda like Neil Olshey now PG is getting roasted on Twitter for that response https://twitter.com/cfilk9_/status/1120917240944054273?s=21 This is a great angle https://twitter.com/chold/status/1120941236741742592?s=21 God could this guy be any better?? Were they playing turbulence over the loud speakers after that shot? Gundy bring the heat!! Fuck you PG!! Dude dehaan I was wondering the same thing lol that's some witchcraft 1,000+ comments on blazers edge. Best fans in the league https://twitter.com/omaroneynba/status/1120944404921892864?s=21 Wow I watched all these in real time. Dudes putting together quite the resume Seriously Is he the greatest blazer ever after tonight? https://www.instagram.com/p/BwoP7gvAHKr/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=1rlwcyna19web Lol dames shot was 
- the same distance as stephs
- won a series and celebrated less than Steph 
- was a step back versus momentum going forward And that Steph shot was still dope Oh and Dame didn't bank it Hahaha ?Is this appropriate office attire? https://twitter.com/complexsports/status/1121042735786541056?s=21 This is amazing ?Only players to drop 50 in a playoff game No Steph, no KD, no Shaq https://twitter.com/chrisbhaynes/status/1121075719117901826?s=21 Must read. Chris Haynes always gets the best dame quotes ? Westbrook was hiding too. They kept putting Schroeder on dame I had to hop on the Thunder SB nation message board. It was great lol I saw a good one yeah. One sec ? Lillard also told Westboork mid game "stop running from this ass whooping" when he switched off Dame lmaoooo Dude read the Haynes piece. It's pure gold Haynes dropped the mic with a triple double comment at the end too That's amazing Dame wants all the smoke Gundy, could this potentially sway voters to put Dame on first team over Steph? I know it's supposed to be regular season but they haven't voted yet have they? Gotcha A couple more footnotes about the game last night 

- OKC shot 55% from the field and 45% from 3 which makes the win even wilder 
- Brandon Roy's comeback against the Mavs was also on April 23rd ?? Remember when "is Dame a top 5 PG" an argument? Lol Not for us, but for dumb media and people like spaceman You know how the warriors have a remix for E-40's "Yup". We needa bring lil flip outta retirement to make a "Dame Over" remix They just picked up his option like 3 months ago lol so they'd have to eat a lot of cash Maybe Presit should be fired?? The mike and mike switch was such an unequivocal upgrade Look how mangled their cap situation is hoomie Not saying I'd fire him, but he deserves some heat as well Steven Adams got exposed this series too. I still think he's a beast, but with dynamic shooters in the pick n roll he's unplayable Can't play Adams And he's making more money than Nurkic, Aminu and Collins combined ?Gross The random high fives and hugs with strangers is something that only sports can do I'm fucking dying haha. Robert Sarver is the fucking worst Funny story, at the company holiday party when I was there. I quit the day before and was moving to SF, so Colby came out and partied with me instead. Turns out Colby won a raffle for $10,000 from Sarver. But you had to be present to claim it Probably the only cool thing Sarver has done. Don't worry I made sure to buy Colby a beer to make up for it https://www.instagram.com/p/Bwpkp2lgUNO/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=1epm6u6g1s0gr Does Dame going supernova get us on AD's radar this summer? Lol low expectations. He's a salesman But this would be his trade radar to be fair It's a fools errand tho cuz we know Neil won't pull the trigger They could get KD, Kyrie and Zion tho. That'd be an instant playoff contender Gundy I just realized we may have to delay the draft pod this year until we're done playing in the finals Totally agree. They strike out every time I hope they get Zion tho cuz fuck Dan Gilbert and his 4 number 1 picks already, and fuck Robert Sarver As a fellow bucks championship backer, I'm with space on this one Giannis is gonna dick slam Tatum or anyone who tries to guard him Bro you're purposely leaving out Middleton (all star), Bledsoe and Lopez lol And they'll get Brogdon back Mirotic could be a wild card too I think Boston would win but also don't be surprised if they don't. There's just so many good teams ?I think it's one of the teams Greg Monroe played for in the last 2 seasons I also hate Kyrie so I may be biased But you're alone on this one gundy Okay experience may matter, but how about momentum? https://www.instagram.com/p/BwqjLX4BXRa/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=14hsysqum1szq Dame setting the tone for the youngsters Tbh I'm kinda over lebron too lol Just all the drama and ego and passive aggressiveness I love it Dylan Clay Travis would be insufferable Clippers getting kawhi? https://www.instagram.com/p/BwqevKiBOnk/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=l2nxca87ru ESPN getting cucked by B/R "You're gonna be all over bleacher report now" -cp Agreed B/R content is actually fire House of highlights is dope af And the athletic is pumping out great long form. May have to subscribe Lol same Like I used to tune in for top 10 but that's not even a thing or interesting anymore Just peep my insta feed and I'm good Turner owns B/R and HoH right? ESPN totally missed the boat on the social media game And the fact that their inside the nba compete includes Paul pierce and Michelle Beadle is just tragic Sorry but this warriors comeback with 4 all stars against an 8 seed right now isn't some inspiring underdog story Lou will with the 4 point play doe Send it Omg Lou will you bad man Durant has 45 right now and they're losing to the clippers rn.

Space you really have the best stories You're a national treasure One time in SF when Cam was cool he took me to a 4am coke party at some mansion.

Hopefully Balmer runs the clippers better than he ran Microsoft ?Dame still bringing the ?????? Is Odell gonna be there wearing your shoes Wasn't this dude projected in the 20's? I need Haskins to Denver Wtf elway Simmons said OKC should bail on Westbrook before he declines and trade him for Lonzo, Kuzma and Hart I wonder if Presti has the balls to trade him or Adams The Steph injury excuses are already in full swing lol this is gonna be fun https://twitter.com/samesfandiari/status/1122530615692128261?s=21 We got another Maroney on our hands Happy birthday brothers ????

Classic That is a fly jacket he's rockin https://twitter.com/therushyahoo/status/1123050538814148608?s=21 That Kyle Lowry dribble thru the legs was so bad lol If he turned that over he woulda got roasted Kanter starting Right? LFG gundy Nah it was snowing so I decided to couch it lol Going to game 2 tho They're hiding Murray on Harkless. Gotta take advantage of that one Dame with the dime! That was filthy Kanter dumb dunk doe https://twitter.com/kingjames/status/1123055971633377286?s=21 James Bond lol Kanter is giving me life rn He's channeling OKC game 1 vibes Meyers gotta get a god damn hand up He's playing like a dude that has cords on his headphones Denver's bench is lethal Top 3 in the league for sure Duck yeah! ?Watch out for Morris in the 3rd I Fucking love kanter Idk about better but we're damn good with him. He's like robin lopez with a post game https://twitter.com/sportstalkbarry/status/1123064943354552320?s=21 Get Harkless out He's back to headcase harkless Dude between that, the miscommunication on the inbounds, and his 0 shot attempts with Murray guarding him... Is lebron wine drunk again? ?Hashtag east coast bias Foh space Trash ass travel call Lillard looking like prime Chris Paul with these pocket passes out the pick & roll Rodney keeping us in this Miles Leonard is back McHale is so dumb Morris first in the nba in 3rd quarter points under 30 seconds lol Jokic is number 1 dad bod Rodney! Afflalo trade still haunting us Dame. Time. Bitches They always give accidental shots flagrant 1s So stupid It used to be intent Now it's result Not feeling to hot right now I feel like Embiid on the shitter pre game That's a fucking joke Get your face out the way God dammit Aminu CJ got the best hands in the league on those strips tho Fuck Beasley is legit With 8 fouls Wtf are these fouls Jokic getting every whistle How is jokic getting prime shaq whistles Jamal Murray is such a pussy I should have been there tonight. This ones on me guys Dames only missed 2 was that open layup in the 4th that shoulda been a foul anyway 8-9 from two CJ came out hitting. Then got real quiet Aminu and Harkless are the keys tbh. One can be bad, but not both Also why did Terry our Harkless on Jokic in the 4th? That's suicide. He should guard plumlee Put* Can't wait for GS to finally lose I'm just happy steph is showing is true colors Averaging the same as siakam It's KD's team Yeah that was terrible for the league Kenny with some lazy analysis saying our small backcourt hurt us against Murray and Harris. They're both 6'4 Lol yeah especially if he's on a down slide Or just keep harden over ibaka They were trying to "balance the team" and kept the big guy Russ woulda had way more trade value too Since harden was still a 6th man Embiid really rocked a Hulu has live sports hoodie post game lmao Ian who did that ad campaign https://twitter.com/mjsgoat/status/1122854593564745728?s=21 Everyone on KD's jock, meanwhile Dame is averaging 34 ppg in 6 games https://twitter.com/larrydn22/status/1123249015552917504?s=21 Savvy move Yeah That is kinda wild Also funny that it's a civil suit only. So this chick doesn't even want to press charges she just wants money? I agree it's definitely easier to win. Just seems like a strange move when that happens Aka the Lakers mafia What did I just watch Gundy idk about that Jokic take. Harkless and Aminu got abused. They're too slight Idk man. He's too big IMO. He got the ball above the FT line and just backed them both down The slightest banging and they called a foul every time All we got his Kanter and Meyers Yeah that was bad. Meyers always plays too far off cuz he's afraid of getting beat If we can force Jokic to live on the perimeter im all for it But dude he will absolutely abuse them in the post Harkless is lacking 30 pounds on Millsap. Double that on Jokic I have no clue. I don't think we can. That's what I'm saying is if we can magically force him to live on the perimeter, then sure put aminu and Harkless on him But that won't happen so imo all we got is Kanter and Meyers lol I'd love to be proven wrong tho Harkless also needs to fucking sack up and punish them for putting Murray on him https://www.instagram.com/malpugh/p/Bw5EsQOH1WP/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=wrp5m0vt7bdp My friends little sister got that Hulu money too I fucking love animal kingdom. Ask mark Animal kingdom and the shitty tnt shooter series are my vices Does anybody watch The Chi? Love that show Dame > kyrie You and me both get them bucks space! Tim hardaway jr Draymond is insufferable I think dwade is gonna be good It's gonna be funny when dwade takes Pierce's job after he talked shit lol Ooh I like the Blake idea Jokic would be good He's joining Portland this summer space The theory is Detroit tears it down and we give expirings, a young guy and a first Who knows what they're doing tho I was gonna make a trade suggestion but don't need spaces laughter calling me a homer lol ? https://twitter.com/matthammondshow/status/1123455788536803329?s=21 As much as I wanna support this, two games isn't really enough sample size to start giving series stats lol Is nila badison gonna be there gundy She's the baddest blazer fan by far lol I met her with pdxbrocialite once Ya boy will be in the building tonight Haha that's great Always wanted to co star with Denzel ?LFG Fucking love that shit. Twice the alcohol content as corona extra Cheers! Moe needs to do that every time Daniel Craig gone You're kidding He's mic'd? And butter fingering the ball at half court like a 6th grader right before that Harkless done?? It's layman time Why'd Kanter come out? He's coming back Maybe he had to take a shit I put laxative in Millsaps Gatorade at halftime. Just give it 15 minutes Divac 4th? Morris with the under 30 seconds points in the 3rd. It's like clock work 7 seconds or less We gotta weather these non dame minutes What a fall from grace having to play in a league that employs Oliver Maroney Guys we just had a great in arena fight Between fans Two 40+ year olds. Blazers fan vs nuggets fan. Then the wives jumped in. Blazers wide threw a mean left hook This is nuts Animosity is high! Is harkless's injury bad?? It's ours They do some dumb shit where the announcer goes "who's ball?!" And the fans say "nuggets ball!"

So I yelled who's ball?! Hella loud after they switched the call and some drunk guy was like "nuggets ball?" ? https://twitter.com/davedeckard/status/1123800098255921152?s=21 Dave Deckard, real fun at parties We traded him for Andrew Nicholson's less shitty contract after 1 year Which we then stretched out over 5 years and is still on our cap til 2022 I'll give Neil credit for the Hood and Kanter moves for sure Stotts has been incredible. He needs a raise and extension stat Could have been Dame dehaan. But I'm willing to give pussy ass olshey a win on that one lol Zach played great but still pissed about that draft Would've rather had JA and John Collins Lol true We've come along way from having to turn to Babbit and Claver off the bench during the Aldridge years! We literally had the worst bench in the league. Every starter played 35 minutes Lol dude believe me it hurt writing that ?? All the culture stuff about our team is 100% dame tho. Literally every guy we've brought in fucking loves him It could come full circle and get us AD this summer who knows! ?Look how Fucking disgusting that was lol Yeah Batum was the streakiest dude I've ever seen I think they had 14 offensive boards in the 4th quarter alone Lol https://www.instagram.com/p/Bw8n9M0Am7Y/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=5hsljwe22ivw Kanter giving no fucks post game https://www.instagram.com/p/Bw8mzE1AIB8/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=3n6ev5w3g4j3 Bold post after playing 0 minutes Rodney is a real one I'd rather keep Rodney over Curry next year Not really He's been so up and down in the playoffs Haha omg undrafted in the big 3 is embarrassing Yeah 27 is a little low Gotta be at least 30 I'm tryna see some old fucks Also, who knew Royce white was still hooping?! Is he gonna take a bus to each game? I had no idea Tri state looks pretty filthy lol yeah that's fake Good call space Gundy what's the word on the street https://twitter.com/msinger/status/1123988712134729728?s=21 God dammit So Layman getting the start? Layman had a killer month during the regular season starting. He's ready We need a wing Cam That keeps the rest of the rotations as in tact as possible If we start ZC who comes off the bench when Kanter comes out? You're giving us major Meyers minutes with that move lol We only have two playable big men right now and one only as 1 shoulder I'm loving ZC too but give him 25 minutes off the bench Layman can D up Craig. Aminu stays on Milsap Yeah https://www.instagram.com/tv/Bw-Tj5Tj7is/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=4m245ubq4rxb Oh boy. We got bandwagon fans now? Wtf hahaha Why is McHale calling playoff games? He's worse than mike rice He also said Torrey Frank last night. Like wtf ?"The sixers are now setup for some sex on Thursday" Whys Houston/GS got 3 days off and Portland is playing every other day ?Good for Kanter call that shit out https://twitter.com/i/events/1123931645894021120 One of us should run for president while we're at it There's like 50 people running for the democratic bid lol Jesus Christ Texas is missing a bowl game this yr Gundy I like the take. Let's run back 77 https://www.instagram.com/p/Bw-kJXSgi4D/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=xbrad9wjh5ay Yeah everyone was roasting him in the comments lol He rocks the Steve Harvey suits The pants are the worst Tbh Barr was being a chicken tho lol https://twitter.com/nbcnews/status/1124361149997375489?s=21 Lol wait what It's like the Tyreek Hill texts but from our president and a dictator When do the piss tapes come out Yeah same Was he just the cheapest coach on the market? Who gets fired first. Boylen or Monty? PHX will lose 5 in a row in November and Sarver will get the itch Can this game just end and get us to the main card Why are they fouling A timeout?! This is absurd haha Omg another foul This 4th quarter has taken 50 minutes You can watch Portland in the Espn app rn Oh shit okay I'm dumb Going from McHale to DB is our biggest upgrade since swapping Felton for Lillard Gimme another 15 from Hood God you gotta love your first team guard diving on the floor Wtf was that fast break PF's were real too. Had two dudes in the paint at all times Eh idk man in the 90's and early two thousands you still at 4's who couldn't shoot outside 10 feet It was definitely a defined position Yeah Mason, Horace grant, Charles Oakley. All those dudes. I guess I'm just saying that was a specialized role. There was no way in hell you'd call that guy a 3, and they were too small at the time to be a 5 But it's interesting that in the early 2000's those muscle bound 4's actually became 5's cuz teams had no answer for Shaq For sure but those were the unicorns. I'm just saying that jacked 6'8 dude that could bang the boards, protect the center, and make a 10 foot turnaround was a very specific role On every team Pierce is so bad. And now they're just ripping him trying to make him some lovable idiot ala Charles and it'll never happen Flop Offensive! He chicken winged em Kanter! Looking like a young mehmet okur Wtf How you gonna call that on Rodney?? Damn Doris is sexy when she's breaking down a perfect close out Short choppy steps get me hard Bukaki Burke has a nice ring to it When does Lillard come back in? 10 min? God Curry is fucking killing us No offense and shitty defense Right Too long of a break Jokic has played the entire 4th. Gonna be gassed at the end Curry needs to sit down for the love of god Curry again Chief or Hood Wtf is terry doing What are these touch fouls Refs are fucking us right now tbh https://twitter.com/omaroneynba/status/1124534073609805824?s=21 During the break I bring you more Maroney "he's a great guy" content Here comes the natural cocaine The heart is racing Gotta go 2 for 1 Let's fucking go Smd James Bond Omg Dame dame dame You have to shoot that You're in the paint That just made zero sense Agreed Refs don't have the balls to call that tho Jokic Obesity factor has gotta come into play here Fuck California Lol Don't tell me you actually wanna live there long term tho do you Imagine if they ejected him FOH Yikes God CJ is incredible He's really turned it around for me. Used to want his ass gone but damn He's Dame lite He's probably got the best iso game after the MVP caliber dudes Heat check Omg No Aminu jumpers!! Hood should for sure be in Why the fuck did we take kanter out That honestly just fucked us Terry has been ass at rotations tonight Agreed dehaan Add terry to the group chat after this so we can flame him Dawg Dame is gassed I'm telling you this is Rodney's time to shine He's our third scorer Holy fuck boys I've never been on this much coke this long Who passes out dead first? Me or Jokic CJ needs to take us home Fouls coming into play. Go at Harris He's got 5 Fuck yes Hearts beating and I have a raging boner LFG!!!!! I'm cumming everywhere Dylan line that shit up!! God dammit Harkless behind the backboard shot was less than ideal God this is just a slugfest Everyone is so tired Dame bring us to the promise land Twitter would explode Nope How did I get an ESPN notification that he missed before he shot it. Fuck Espn Will is fucking us Omg he's unreal Welp Last chance 2 for 1 Give it to CJ We're gonna get this This is like the ncaa championship play where in real time it was a no brainer but the replay shows otherwise Dame Dagger to the heart End it This is un fucking real I love sports!!! Get a steal and a bucket It's destiny Omg hahaha Fuck that pussy haha https://twitter.com/worldwidewob/status/1124552884182487040?s=21 Cuz he's washed Hoodie time! Hoodie!!! Farm animals! Catch and shoot. Get that 2 for 1 !!!!!!! I'm cumming again!!! Dehaan you and I called that shit Olshey is our savior Oops too far? Really? They gonna call that? I forgot his legs are mashed potatoes and lard at this point Looks like a make a wish kid Best game ever!!!! Un fucking real Glad you stayed up with us Dylan I'm doing ass bongs tonight This didn't age well ? Portland took 124 shots lmao. Box score doesn't even look real ? ?Denver Post cover tomorrow https://twitter.com/mikegrich/status/1124564106566987776?s=21 ?Me texting myself after this game Haha shit my bad. It was the first one I saw https://www.instagram.com/p/BxB_K73gg-Y/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=tqs2tm04h5i Omg I wanna run thru a brick wall for Enes ?Ah, the fit explains the performance Gotta drop 40 when you wearing that jacket Really? So we're down to ZC and Meyers pole Lol* Against the best center in the league Truuuuu Just tell him to put a damn hand up Meyers? Familiar for lyfe Bolo tie for the win I just took a fat shit at a bar. Real low point boys Sorry guys in the fetal position watching this one. Got a little turnt last night but I'm sticking it out for the team This is my kanter performance Scott foster game Wtf is wrong with dame Missed free throws are fucking us God dammit Houman take your rational takes somewhere else https://www.denverpost.com/2019/05/06/nikola-jokic-enes-kanter-nba-playoffs/ Oh boy.

He tweets some good breakdowns What a career rejuvenation too. He was toast on the pelicans. I thought the knee injuries doomed him That summer Houston gave him 4/48 and Ryan Anderson 4/80 lmao should've been the other way around ?Lol Just horrible timing lol dope collaboration tho Oh for sure. It's all coming to a head now tho Could have played his last home game as a Celtic I like bad shot ?This sums up our fortunes perfectly Yeah Harris has been in his grill like crazy. He's had less space to operate But he also missed a shit ton of open jumpers in game 4 Great point I think he's gotta enforce his will early on in game 5. Denver isn't scared of him right now I think we're due for an Aminu 6-9 3pt FG game The pendulums gotta swing the other way I feel like Denver is a little overconfident too Or maybe just their fan base but I put that on the team too lol As a new Coloradan I feel pretty ashamed. I hoped they'd be the just happy to be here type fans They're already pretty insufferable Yeah man that stadium was pretty empty when I was there game 2 It's definitely a hockey / football town You'd think a number 2 seed after years of suffering would get people hard If tickets drop to 30 again tonight I may have to pull up We won last time I was there Let's do it What would Conor Ryan do https://twitter.com/royceyoung/status/1125818222911971328?s=21 What an interesting angle to follow Wait you can't drink water either can you? Damn. Gonna be interesting Cam are you copping the Travis Scott 1's? Yeah that's what I'm thinking May the luck be on our side brother Haha god what a legend that guy is ?Liga poll time. Which is the correct way to hang the tp Glad we're on the same page. The janitors at my office hang it under and it's getting on my last nerve They clearly don't shit much I could use a line too man. I feel you https://twitter.com/nbcnews/status/1125877461206671361?s=21 Smh Should I pull a spaceman and take a random lesbian to the game tonight? I got like 2 friends in Denver and they're both outta town Yeah I might have to couch it by myself Fill up a cold glass of familiar and scream my brains out at the tv I may do it alone. I'll keep you guys updated Probably won't make any friends rooting for the away team but who knows 90 on Saturday?! It's fucking raining here right now Fuck global warming Or perhaps daddy yankee ?Matt can you put a Steph face on Carlton? Tryna get my Twitter ammo ready for his next 7-23 night Damn gonna be a lit summer boys Wow. Can't wait to run it back 2019 stylez https://twitter.com/enes_kanter/status/1125886589270396928?s=21 Class act Kanter Jalen and jacoby both said boogie should stay with the warriors one more year That would be so incredibly lucky for them if that happened Warriors have caught so many breaks already. Stephs ankles contract, cap spike for KD, boogie Achilles Tanking for Harrison Barnes on the last day of the season Can we please get rid of McHale smh Regardless, let's fuck go boys Shoulda went rip city All these cross matches on D are gonna cause problems on the other end Exhibit A; last play CJ looking like a traffic cone on transition D I'm kinda intrigued with Aminu on Jokic. I was against it at first but he's got a block already Jesus Christ Yes! Wtf is wrong with dame at the line! Fucking pisses me off Make the freebies 92% during the regular season cmon dawg Harkless is like a moody ex gf. You always remember the good times and then every time you get your hopes up, you realize how much she sucks Moe should be able to post up scrawny ass Murray every play But he doesn't Let's go chief Little chair pull there Hood gotta sacrifice the body there Rodney hood can fuck my bitch The ghost of the millsap offer sheet haunting blazer fans to this day Is Rodney the most hood duke player ever? Wow great call Dylan Who had the higher ugly to good ratio? Tayshaun or andrei kirelinko Z eazy! Just imagine Collins and kanter behind a healthy Nurk And then AD at the 4 when we trade for him And Dame has called him by name every time he's asked who he'd like to play with Two on Jokic! We gotta go on a run here Cut it to 2 by the end of the quarter Lillard going downhill every time please Questionable non foul call there Refs choked on their whistles there not wanting to call a foul on a half court heave Let's ride with that Jokic has to sit for at least the first 3 minutes. We gotta have the lease before he comes back in Lead Omg Zach Dude Hits your hands shoulda caught it As my coach always said Turner is Fucking trash Get him out If we have to double every post up they're gonna get open 3s all night So Jokic sits and the nuggets go +4 That's not gonna get it done Yeah chill out young fella Omg Foul! What the fuck Refs clearly didn't call it cuz they knew he had 2 That's such bs Omg Wtf is going on Two four point plays he's whiffed It's all mental Dame asking for the shot when he clearly passed lol God give me a 3rd on Jokic Make up call He's gonna bull over Aminu in the post and get an offensive Was it an uncrustable So they call that on Kanter but not a hip check to the deck on Jokic Travel!! Are you kidding me Dame pulled the chair that was ridiculous Aminu + Harkless gotta make more than 1 three a game Fuck No heart If dame makes a pair we're winning Murray is such a bitch Omg another miss Welp were ducked It bugs me that guys can take 2 steps into a jumper like that now That's a travel Drink every time Lillard makes a free throw. You'll be dead sober Sorry guys this is on me. I shoulda been there Mark if we get it to single digits pop that bottle Anthony Bennett has joined the chat I didn't pull the trigger space. Dropped the ball https://www.instagram.com/p/Bkdz0R9FCdi/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=fn6eoul4gkfi Since the game sucks here's some Taylor rooks content https://twitter.com/nateduncannba/status/1125971655874842626?s=21 Ok so take shots in the paint. Ready? Break! How is that not continuation That's what I thought Bitches Hey guys Harkless and Aminu still aren't making 3's Paging Zach Lowe Could Ed Davis have been the X factor on Millsap this series? ?? Might have been worth the 4 milly Olshey playing checkers while everyone else is playing chess Olshey meanwhile is bragging about our average age (while signing 3 18 year olds to sit on the bench) As bad as swanigan was, he might have even helped on Milsap We need some beef Aminu 3 we back baby!! Honestly I'd rather lose this way than by 2 We're gonna win 6 then game 7 is a coin flip Very true Ian Last 7 minutes is gonna be Simons vs IT iso's That's an odd way to spell shitty Meyers sighting McHale has called every game except the 4OT one hasn't he Dubov I thought the same thing Literally just boxed him out Look at the bright side. Nobody on the east coast is watching us anyway Hahahaha Game 7 pre game at my house Down Dame needs to suck it up. It's 79 and sunny in Portland who gets sick White boy three bombs Getting us back in it Put Layman in! No Ian we're gonna win duh Yeah Layman gives us more than ET tbh Wow great idea Gundy 12 at 6 is still in play Oh boy! You called it haha Dubov say the blazers win by 2 now Gotta love Zach always being down to mix it up Omg the nba is so soft Vulnerable airborne player? Jokic has never been airborne At least the nba doesn't have a dead dog tho Simons time Hahahahaha Great reference Wtf is Malone doing with Jokic and Harris still in https://twitter.com/btrowland/status/1125987840293244928?s=21 When did we turn into the 2009 Memphis tourney team Meanwhile the announcers are talking about this being the end of the road or them lmao wtf God I wish Nurkic could have been in this battle with us ? Denver talking about how they haven't been to the WCF since '09. Try 19 years for us poor fans. We need it Lowe was right. We live and die by how well Aminu and Harkless shoot. We need a 3 point threat in the front court next year Jalen rose thinks AD is gonna go to Phoenix to reunite with Monty Williams. I like the idea but he proposed the #1 pick, Josh Jackson AND Ayton No way New Orleans fetches that much with AD basically on a 1 year contract right? The funny think is James Jones said the suns are gonna go after "players in their prime" Lol aka Sarver is impatient But I agree with Ian. AD is worth Ayton OR Zion. Not both. He could leave after one year If the suns would have drafted just semi well they'd be in much better shape. Like maybe picking Jamal Murray over Dragan Bender, or De'Aaron Fox over Josh Jackson when they needed a PG How about Westbrook and Adams for Booker, Ayton, Jackson and fillers See it's not the result of the season so much It's his enormous contract, wreckless style of play that doesn't age well, can't shoot I think he can start shooting better ala Jason Kidd late in his career But the contract and potential athleticism drop off could be bad How can OKC tinker tho gundy? They're completely capped out with 3 guys Adams, Westbrook and PG take up 90% of the cap lol Add in Schroeder and they're over the cap with 4 guys Fair Yeah especially with KD potentially gone I really hope kawhi stays east https://www.instagram.com/p/BxNUNvHFjit/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=1y21qrqg0jc0y Fuck Nick Gilbert I hope he gets the 14th pick ?Greatest return from retirement since Jordan? ?I think the whole thing. We got Alex Morgan too That was the last one I swear Ian I got a draft take. Zion will be the number 1 pick, but he may or may not be the best player in the draft Matisse looks like a late first in the mocks. Same with PJ. I'd love if Portland took either Yeah he could def go lottery Him and Brandon Clarke are all over the board right now ?All these are pretty pointless rn but https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1126242657666306056?s=21 What's going on ZC getting some love on the Lowe pod https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1126256298025279488?s=21 Lol so it's done? Different coach? Omg haha. What about his birthday cake?! How about metta world peace https://www.instagram.com/p/BxNP-2rlUXC/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=1ct20duyxqm57 https://twitter.com/mcten/status/1126259947262631941?s=21 Lmao wow shoutout to ty lue flexing on em Go make it rain space Better body up Ian https://twitter.com/shamscharania/status/1126264394550267905?s=21 Lmao murderers row over here Potentially. He was ass in Orlando Doesn't have the resume or cache of a Lakers coach tho None of those guys do Top 5 brand in sports But also a laughing stock They still are Fan base and market ain't going anywhere It honestly sucks they have lebron cuz that's hampering everything lol. Can't have a normal coach with him I mean if lebron wasn't there I'd go with a young up and comer Dude they are for sure a powerhouse name. It's just a zoo for several reasons at the moment. The lakers don't just lose and gain allure on a whim Lebron is so goddamn high maintenance I can't believe I called him the GOAT at one time Not that I can remember Ian. You're right Closest they got in the last decade was coach K But you're both right, who is a big name unemployed coach right now? There's not really Jeff van gundy is the nba's bill cowher Bring don Nelson off the weed farm Joerger been fired twice tho Honestly I think Vanterpool is gonna be a goddamn stud Who's the young college guy next in line? Yeah Shaka flamed our Maybe Chris beard? Jay Wright would be bad ass but he ain't leaving https://www.instagram.com/p/BxNyXa1A8HZ/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=1mqorqg5wkst You think? Pinstripes is more of an east cost look tho Haha touch https://twitter.com/sportstalkbarry/status/1126277406543831042?s=21 Bron fed up ?? Lol no gundy I'm trollin What's your theory space Remember last year when people were like "would you rather have Giannis or Brad Stevens?" Lmao They literally played better and won more with the same team, minus kyrie and Hayward. That's absurd Ian I think that's the most you've ever combined into one single text. Congrats But yes I concur with all that. Just a likable superstar. Feel good story Also I love that story from his rookie year. When he was wiring money back to his family. And he went to western union and accidentally wired back his entire paycheck. So he didn't have any money to get to the stadium for his game, and started jogging down the street to the game. Some random family stops and is like "yo are you that bucks rookie? Wanna ride to the game?". And he casually gets in lmao PJ Tucker playing center right now lmao Familiar is next level space. Crisper, Fuller taste and more alcohol content. Sign me up Was there one consistent face of the nba post Jordan pre lebron? Like 99-07 Gotta be shaq, Kobe, Duncan, Iverson, Nash right ?Do you wear a bathrobe to the bodega ala Carmelo? Oh yeah I think that was around 03 Dehaan lol Agree Rengel Lol that would be nuts Internet would explode Fuck the sharks Fuck the bay Yeah sorry space I was just saying who was the face of the nba From 99 post MJ to 07 when lebron cemented it I can't believe Nash won an MVP averaging 15 Fucking points lmao Wow looking at these stats is pretty wild now Nash was 18th in PER and 15th in win shares lmao Amare averaged 26/9 and was 3rd in win shares and 4th in PER Kobe and lebron both averaged 27/6/6 but missed the playoffs Honestly shoulda been Dirk that year. 26/10/3. 2nd in win shares. 5th in PER. Team finished 4th He got hosed No more west firepower This is Portland's time https://www.instagram.com/p/BxOZii6oLgn/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=xxb1wqint6r Are they gonna post this after every series lol Omg KD Achilles Might be torn Dude he's done Holy shit guys this is destiny It's our turn for fortune Yeah that sucks Built in excuse now Omg what if this is the one thing that makes KD stay in GS now Then they win 3 more when he recovers Is KD really gonna change teams on a torn Achilles? Think about it Lol gundy you watching the game on dial up? Poor warriors tho. Two all stars down and they only have 3 left A true underdog story He is a fraud I'm gonna revel in every moment Matt how's that Carlton Steph meme coming? https://twitter.com/rudygay/status/1126343617231114241?s=21 Fellow Achilles tear club analysis Lillard top PG in the league After Steph shits his pants https://twitter.com/shamscharania/status/1126345048789065729?s=21 That was quick Woj said not Achilles It's a calf I bet they're posturing Update came too quick In your defense shams is all gated content now that he's with the athletic. I'm a free 99 guy myself I love how an injury happens and instantly everyone becomes a twitter doctor The whole world turns into Houman with an offshore medical degree Wow KD bloody sock game. I love that He starts backing people down above the 3pt line like magic with AIDS ?KD coming back for game 7 ?KD can't wait with them cats Win* Paul is pretty washed now tho. Harden and Gordon carry the load 2 for me Saving the other 4 for tomorrow https://twitter.com/profootballdoc/status/1126347323879989248?s=21 A real doctor speaks! Curry so trash Riding Klay and draymond Fuck Curry is so bad Bailed him out Not top 20 Damn They had the turnover Foul on Livingston? He sat on Gordon's head Fuck curry and his bitch ass Wait if all these series go 7, we get a game 7 triple header on Sunday? I'll be cumming my pants all day On the sabbath no less That's incredible ?Whoa ESPN talking about the Lakers trading Lebron lmaooo Wed have to trade CJ for him I'd trade CJ, Simons and Meyers Lmao I know it sounds ridiculous But his market would be very unique How many teams actually would trade for him? 5 or 6? Yeah that's a good point space Also only 2 years on his deal which plays into it as well Honesty if I were LA I'd just see if New Orleans would swap AD for Lebron lol Lakers add AD to all their young guys and sign Klay Can we see some S&T's for once this summer? Disgruntled star swaps or something It is pretty incredible how they've built that team.. but when you find the next lebron that's pretty much all you need Haha exactly Yeah I like bud Ian I'm wfh today too. My boss is in Hawaii all week I was like what am I doing going into the office ?Also check out this May sun!!! Lol I'm a suburb guy now I go to Home Depot and shit on the weekends The old man life is honestly pretty sweet tbh ?And I can see downtown from my place. Just a quick Uber to the fun Cam, yes there's some quaint townhouses right down the block I'm trying to recruit more bros Think about all the snowboarding biscuit! Got offered WCF tickets for $100 from my nuggets guy and almost pulled the trigger.... Then I was like hold up why would I pay to go to an empty stadium? Suck my dick Portland in 7!! I hope that's the juju we needed I can tell you, leaving California was a breath of fresh air. Both literally and figuratively As much as I enjoy partaking in my civic duty to pay taxes, they can smdftb Gundy the more I think about it, the more I'm convinced that Blake Griffin is our best chance at the promise land He's the missing piece We need beef and shooting at the 4. Obviously he's kind of a pipe dream but that would be the perfect player for our current roster Agreed. It'd have to be an ownership wanting to save money move On a more realistic note; Marcus Morris, jaMychal green, Bobby Portis would all be interesting options Yeah they suck I'm desperate here. The bar is closing and I'm squinting real hard I agree. We just need one more shooter. We can't rely on Harkless and Aminu to make open shots consistently Space I'm glad someone else stayed home to talk hoops midday with me I'm watching Russilo and Jacoby right now I love me some Jalen and jacoby And PTI I'll record those and watch the cliff notes every so often https://www.instagram.com/p/BxQF-9UpJV-/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=1ujrv1cuvwhk0 Protest! Me to Clay When you Shazam a song does it automatically add the full song to a playlist for you?? I got amazon movies with prime free so there Dude what do you do if you hear a song you like?? Nah talking to Dubov lol like if you hear a random song somewhere I honestly use it a lot in my car. Cuz I got Sirius XM. So if a dope song comes on I just Shazam it and it automatically adds it to a playlist on Apple Music for me Siri bro! Everything's hands free these days hip hop nation is a great way to find new songs I actually do have some songs that were on my laptop iTunes library and won't sync over to my phone and it's killing me Yeah honestly I'm probably gonna switch to Spotify for that space lol Just been too lazy Hahaha Ian with the hard shutdown We needa expand our horizons. I'll listen to Morrissey and Dubov can listen to Anthony Hamilton Lol he sang the national anthem at the all star game Btw we got Mark Jones and Hubie Brown on the call tonight. Talk about an upgrade https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1126569206382829568?s=21 Game 7 with no Durant. Let's make it happen https://twitter.com/adamschefter/status/1126584804739301377?s=21 ?? I think Baldwin is retiring https://www.instagram.com/tv/BxQWkYGjT1P/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=pf0egoql5wig Wow this is a good one. The dirk scene has me dying "Double dirks!" "Will you let me play power forward even tho I'm really a center?" Lmao Dude I'm fucking dying haha. That was a good one Cuban "go do European things like eat wine and cheese" ? So good. It had everything Magic, BBB, dirk on his deathbed, bron being a snake Lol playoff push ?? The point of the post is to make fun of steph Houman. We're not tryna be fair and rational here I love how everyone is writing us off after one game. Everybody I've listened to today has Denver written in pen ?Bad juju. Nuggets lose I hope you're saying bad as in sexy ?ET swaggin tonight. Maybe he'll score more than 2 points Big dawg with a little dog I can't wait to get one Yeah I feel like it's frowned upon to go to a breeder these days Still gonna do it Off to a killer start boys!! Harkless looking like one of those puppy's on Valium on defense rn God damn that CJ floater was filthy Kept Harris on his back the whole way Shut the fuck up mark You're blocked Alright we're not gonna win if we give up 120 points Does everyone else see Dylan's texts from his phone and his email? Every other message Feed Rodney God dame just fucked the whole team with these missed free throws 4 point swing there Can't Fucking do that shit Miss 2 free throws then end up with Seth Curry guarding jokic with 5 seconds left? Wtf ET on millsap really? Has that worked one time Turner is getting eaten alive down low he's been in 2 minutes Honestly Meyers has to play We can't play with 1 big on the court at a time Good minutes from your brother cam! Fuck will If Collins becomes 40% from three we're gonna be so dangerous Has a player ever been cut mid game? I nominate ET ET so far
- gets killed twice on offensive boards
- millsap easily scores on him
- butter fingers easy offensive rebound right under the rim 
- turns it over right when we get momentum Suga Gee's Named after his mom Teal is her favorite color Let's go!! Superb half from ZC Yeah he had a straight shot to the hoop and lost it smh Dare I say...? She's a cunt But for real that's wild haha I was at a bar that had the winter X games on the projector. V Denver Zach, dame and Cj should play the entire 2nd half Just rotate the other 2 spots Yeah he makes shoes for the people He took the boost out of em so they'd be more affordable Collins and Rodney are better than Aminu and Harkless in every facet of the game right now I'll accept all promo fees Absurd Free throws.. I have a new found love for Malika Andrews Yeah wtf Guys I'm cumming again!! Cam you're always behind haha Are you streaming it? Dude Moe is so bad He has zero offensive moves He tries to post up Murray and just throws the ball at the backboard Moe Meyers and ET. $37 million dollars to make a negative impact Where is Dame Gundy text terry Like on the blindside when Sandra Bullock calls the coach during the game I like Malone a lot Terry has always been mr no adjustment tho He's gonna ride this til the tv timeout Logo lizard is trending lol Still no dame? Rodney can fuck my bitch Fight! Cam cover your eyes Wtf is thrills problem Also curry wanted no smoke I love that Zach is always in the mix Fucking love that guy Wow Offsetting really?? Such a cop out Ummmm Why is ET in?? ET is so bad And 1!! Wtf haha What are they gonna suspend him for after the fact? Didn't even call anything on the floor Silver doesn't have those kinda balls Worst case they add a flagrant Dubov Suspension is so many levels passed ejection and he didn't even get ejected Collins > Jokic I didn't see a punch. And neither did the refs apparently I would be completely shocked if he got suspended But let's hope he does! I saw the finger wag That's just disrespectful Terry thought Oregon voted for the legal mushrooms Cumming again!! CJ is a Fucking sight to see man Guys party at my house! Lines for everyone! Cmon guys what do ya say It's either 1:30 or 5:30 I think Sunday Cmon guys don't be pussys Are we the biggest blazers group chat or what?

God Zach Collins podium game He's growing up before our eyes Also looked like Chaz Michael michaels with those sequins on Hahaha I was gonna play fake hype man and be like "ohhhh boy hit em with the juice Oliver! I know you got them receipts!" Portland to Denver $347 round trip flights Sassy is kind of a pussy word but I'll take it Man I'll tell you what tho. I just did a 180 on Jokic after that Nurk comment. That was dope Yeah we're gonna beat the shit outta those bitches on Sunday Mother's Day ass whooping Reading b edge and Denver stiffs tho, these fans are hostile af I'm gonna need security in the Pepsi center after Portland wins I'll represent the liga well. You'll all be with me in spirit https://www.instagram.com/p/BxRUi-0gywl/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=65cc64v8gidn God I can't wait to get him back. What a quote Yeah dehaan I agree. Idk if we're gonna be able to pay them tho There's a bunch of fucked up contract restraints on what we can offer a one year player, and we don't have the MLE cuz we're in the tax Nah like we can't physically offer them over a certain amount. With the one year deals. We don't have full bird rights Yeah that was so fucked gundy We can yeah but it's capped at a low dollar amount. Basically like 150% of what they are currently making plus yearly raises. And Curry, Kanter and Hood have all outplayed their deals. I'll try and see what best case scenario we could offer them is I mean Ian, that's pretty bad lol you can't just say that's a harmless joke I don't think it should be a headline, but the dude definitely needs to apologize and probably the team too ??Dehaan here is the Curry situation. Olshey fucked up my not offering him the full Taxpayer Mid Level, which lowered the ceiling you could offer Curry if he played well this year (which happened) Yeah Space quit moving the goal posts Most we could offer Hood or Kanter is probably the tpMLE which would be 3 years 18 million Probably an on air apology at the minimum Honestly that's just really fucking bush league pettiness coming from them tho We should feel lucky we got a group of class acts on our side KC, Lamar, Wheels Is he sick again? Damn. I mean homie ain't in the greatest shape. He needs the Al Roker surgery He is massive. Fond memories of listening to him call games on the radio when I didn't have cable in elementary school Last thing on the salary cap, we may have to use our 1st to shed ET and try to duck under the Tax. Then we'd get the Full MLE and the Bi-Annual Exception and be able to likely keep all 3 guys ?Some good tickets popping up. These are row 2 for $120 each When do you guys think is the best time to buy? Think the price only goes up from here? https://twitter.com/worldwidewob/status/1125986761681854465?s=21 Wow good call dudes Okay I'll buy this morning CJ averaging more than Steph in the playoffs makes me so happy Also crazy that the nuggets have done so well putting this roster together while also getting nothing for Nurkic and drafting and trading both Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert for nothing lmao They probably shouldn't trade with Utah anymore Denver a bunch of fair weather front runners Cam that sizing thing is a game changer. I already buy most clothes/shoes online but not knowing the right fit is so annoying ?Hahaha Karmel coming in hot and this nuggets writer is pissed Does he not realize the dude is a comedian I don't reach much local stuff, but that article was so arrogant and condescending even for local standards After 3 months here I can confirm that sentiment clay Dude every city I've been in outside Oregon Fucking loves hockey. Hate to break it to you Even Phoenix We're in the minority Yeah it's interesting how our biases can play such a role in perception. I feel like it's NBA over everything but the ratings are pretty shit compared to other sports Haha true everyone is transplants so there's no Phoenix fans This Ben Shapiro thing is hilarious too. He went on BBC to promote his book about politics becoming so enraged and divisive. Then proceeded to yell at the interviewer, rip his mic off and storm out I think Elon is right. This is all a simulation and we're being trolled When did Denver get so high and mighty? They didn't even make the playoffs last year Yeah they were bitching super hard about fouls last night, yet they shot more free throws? Alright guys ya boy is in the building Section 138 Only $113 I was surprised Did Maroney ever produce receipts? But dude ice cube is one of the most genuinely good dudes I've ever been around. It's amazing to see that guy juggle so many things from movies to music and now a basketball league And they're all picking the nuggets as the best chance to win the title outside of the warriors ??????? And Jalen rose thought the nuggets were the #1 seed lmao That group is a mess And so bad at it ? https://twitter.com/chrisbhaynes/status/1127013881321283585?s=21 Pujols himself told the fan to keep it didn't he? https://twitter.com/colincowherd/status/1127013386720440320?s=21 This is one of the stupidest takes I've ever fuckin seen Inject this curry performance into my veins God I was ready to roast Steph after that first half but I can't say shit now Where do the rockets go from here? Stay the course? CP played well tonight but idk how much he has left in the tank Fuck this SNKRS app I just want the Travis Scott's ? https://twitter.com/joelegacy_/status/1127216591110852608?s=21 Dubov can you confirm or deny that this was a setup ?Yeah it's the number 1 trend right now lol. Apparently that was the most hyped drop of the year I agree with mark Also kinda of a side note, but does Nike care one way or another about the whole bot epidemic? I'm sure they dgaf and just wanna sell shoes But it'd be real easy to screen for those and let real people get the shoes Oh really? See never made it that far so I wouldn't know lol I don't think adidas does tho cuz I know a guy who wrote a bunch of scripts and buys every yeezy that way For sure https://www.instagram.com/p/BxVWamDDDdI/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=wfugudymcec2 Wtf is this bullshit Stay east fam Foh it's Portlands show in the west now Vogel szn baby! Game day boys! ?Good call on the tickets mark. I got 100 level for under $120 ???? Rob done got cucked ?Gettin ready to talk mad shit And I dusted off the concords. This is a business trip LFG baby ?Were in the building ZC getting good contests on millsap he's just hitting everything Evan Turner is the worst player in the nba There's not a single shot that I feel good about when it comes out his hand His short arm shot is uglier than Aminu's catapult Meyers time He's in Fuck Is that an Achilles? Didn't look like an ankle How the fuck was Zach in with 4?? Meyers and good moe I'm bout to nut Wow it's getting hostile in here folks ? God guys I'm getting fucked hyped rn Just so y'all know. This is for the liga!!! Dude in a Lillard jersey just came and sat next to me too lmao we're carrying this entire section Dude ET game CJ is locked in too CJ needs to carry us home 4 minutes from the WCF boys this is what sports is all about!!!! ? ? ? ? Guys I'm so hyped. I love sports. I love you guys. I love the blazers Now excuse me while I go get hammered ?Dame and momma dame embrace Omg they were so mad. Honestly I wasn't talking shit either. I told the guy next to me I was just gonna celebrate and not talk shit They were all pointing at me booing. Saying we're gonna get swept Bro this is a team of destiny We're doing it for PA and Nurk I kinda like Meyers now? Meyers played and didn't do terrible! ET too! I hate those fuckers more than anything but i gotta give them shine when due Also, dame last game calling out Meyers by name and saying he provides a ton of leadership meant something to me If dame fucks with you, I fuck with you Not fully, but still. Give him props Gundy and I ain't letting up on this one Meyers has a dead dog and is a cuck but he's our pussy Dude such an incredible win What did Charles and team say after? I haven't seen any broadcast Harkless killed it. Big time dunk and good D Denver went so cold too Was Charles reaffirming his blazers finals prediction? Mark Guess where I'm at?? Well to end the suspense. I'm at a strip club. Mark loves it Go Blazers Mark I'm at shotgun Willies hahah Interesting Sunday crowd Yep!

Anything is possible Who's that Yeah he's been talking shit about the blazers all year I don't get it. There's gotta be some back story As the kids would say "Matt Moore punching the air right now" Yeah Houman can we get a Fucking update already? How many people got the final 4 right? I know I did ?Learn from the pro Yeah the hardest is picking the exact number of games tho Like Celtics sweep round 1 I'd rather the Lakers than the Cavs Same MVP vs 8th man isn't like some epic brother battle ?Thank the lord Speak it into existence cam Hahaha ?Nila's response lmao I could see that tbh Wow nba Twitter with a great point. We gotta root for the bucks cuz if it's the raptors we play in the finals, kanter can't travel to Toronto Can you imagine Meyers Leonard starting in an NBA Finals game lmao ?Man this is a rag tag group compared to 2000 Has Neil been vindicated? Kanter and Hood both. We don't win game 3 or game 6 without Hood Eh idk space. Nurk's defense is on another level. Kanter has been similar offensively tho Gundy with the best doctor take of the year Omg Go home John Cue the blazers in 6 jokes This is our 2011 Mavs moment https://twitter.com/shamscharania/status/1128012606491570181?s=21 God I'm listening to this too gundy cuz nuggets tears are PED's for me and Matt Moore is insufferable Wow Kanter ate Halal Guys in SF at 3:50am this morning. We're basically the same person except he's doing it for Ramadan in the nba playoffs and I did it after an 8 hour bender in the marina It's official, Dubov is a Meyers fan! Or should I say a Miles fan Blazers gotta be above them now Meyers Lmao he's the unicorn we've been waiting for 7 years building up his powers Kerr is shaking in his boots KD ain't doing too hot https://twitter.com/bball_ref/status/1128037246635061250?s=21 Oh for sure space. Still got 3 all stars and an MVP lol Yeah the tweets and memes about that are killing me lmao ?

We needa bring that team back and recognize em at a game Oh and Pippen Wow good call. Make it happen Wowowow Inject that into my veins Oh god. Dame already had a "blazers in 6" type comment and is trying to walk it back now He said the warriors are due for an upset and Royce young threw it in an article. Now dame is denying he said that lol Inverse effects baby. More trade wars please! Royce is a thunder guy yeah? Fuck that dude Gundy that guy deleted the KD tweet. Lol Lol who is that guy. Does he know anything Yeah just look at the difference between Embiid and Towns reactions to jimmy. Joel loves him ?Lol yeah take that L on the way out blazers Guys we're 8 wins away from being champions ?Black voters ain't feeling him that's for sure Yeah who's gonna challenge Biden? Beto has faded so fast Bernie is too radical.

My row at like 8 empty seats https://twitter.com/brucefeldmancfb/status/1128412240216875009?s=21 Ducks got a 5 star CB transfer Bad fucking look for Florida too. Apparently he transferred cuz he was concerned about his roommate who then got arrested for sexual assault and that the coaches didn't take it seriously etc ? Dope ass video Ready to run thru a wall Hahaha Casey's response to BR We're gonna win games 2 and 3 This ones a toss up Kanter gonna average 5 offensive boards a game Maybe I'm just a cynic but it seems so contrived to me. They're trying to be inside the nba 2.0 Ramona is reporting the Knicks #1 priority is getting Zion and Shams is saying its trading the pick for AD. Gotta side with shams on this one Hahaha God fuck nick gilbert That fucker better get the 3rd pick Omg Lakers moved up Top 4 Holy shit This is wild Hahahaha Chicago Hahaha and Phoenix Chicago was 4 I think Yes Fuck nick Gilbert Sure did Atlanta got 10 and 8 ?

And Memphis takes Mike Conleys replacement What does Conley fetch in a trade?? What! That's a lot man Conley old as fuck The longer they wait Conley is gonna fall off a cliff I would trade him this summer They're not winning anytime soon so why keep him Alright boys let's fucking go!! I think the Jazz wanted him to replace Rubio. Seems like a Jazz player Indiana would be another good fit I think we can get AD for Collins and Simons probably https://www.instagram.com/p/BxdsvgVBaoN/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=1wib97rs5kn87 All the sales reps lmao. "We're gonna sell so many tickets fuck yes!!!" Justin Lehrbaum worked for the Cavs when they got Lebron back. And he said that they switched to fully inbound cuz the phones were just ringing off the hook "Oh you wanna spend $30k? I'll send over an order" Whack Draymond was in the restricted area That's old news space lol Haussecker's buddy works there he got 250k haha We're getting to the rim well! Wtf was that moe Shams saying AD still wants a trade Kanter drawing doubles? Lol This is epic Do they think he's shaq? I'm confused That's 3 times in a row they've doubled him Wow that was a gimme for Zach Meyers would dunked it Aminu already with more minutes than last game lol Trash ass 3 Story of the first was turnovers Boom! Good ending tho If we make 3 turnovers instead of 6 we're leading Yeah he's kinda pressing I have a good feeling about Zach this series. He's gonna eat Yeah they picked him up like 2 months ago lol Nooooooo That was a great move Jesus Leaning in off one foot Jesus two banks!!! Wtf is this Us They were up 4 when he went to the bench tho and Jordan bell just made a circus shot We're in a good spot You can crate a theory for every team tho lol Like oh New Orleans got it cuz the league felt bad AD wanted out Jesus we can't make easy tip ins I thought the same things Also draymond using both shoulders on post D This is where we gotta make sure this doesn't get away from us Take away the two circus bank shots and we're right there One foot fade-away after his shot got blocked. That was accidental Turnovers 3 on Klay let's goooo Oh wow they gave us the shot on that Fuck Wtf dame Wow What a turn of events 12 turnovers? We're a second half team. We got this! Yeah mark I think you're still missing the point lol Mark we know what a double sided jersey is But they said Sonya chose Portland and dell chose GS. They both wore both Neither picked a side Jesus fuk Right where we left off God the margin of error against the warriors is so small I mean we're playing pretty good D Were the ones playing like shit You could see that charge coming the second Aminu put the ball on the floor Drink every time we turn it over Pretty disappointed with terry on the game plan there. Every year we've played the warriors we hang back on Curry pick n rolls and get roasted. It's not rocket science Take a shot! https://twitter.com/marcjspearsespn/status/1128473063409049600?s=21 Lol he didn't look too happy in the interview after New Orleans won Cut it to 8 by the end of the quarter and we're gucci ? Needed that from Rodney Shit swings so quickly Especially with Looney behind Steph. He ain't even rolling Guys we could steal this game Rodney Hood gonna fuck Sonya curry tonight Well he's gonna fuck her in the ass so he's gonna see his son Steph Guys we're only down 6 points. We can win this motherfucker Fucking system guy Dudes trash JVG makes a good point. I don't see the advantage of playing 10 feet off Bell and Draymond and allowing them to make an easy pass to shooters It's not like Collins is doing anything productive when he's sagging off That guy is such a hardo. He wants to be like the losers who do the light years podcast so bad What he do Smh why even jump at that That's definitely a moving pick Aka the Bogut special I think we still gotta shot Cut it to 8 with 2 minutes left Alright that's it Shitty ass game But honestly I feel good about game 2 It was like the Denver series. We were never taking game 1 on the road let's be real It's only up from here! ?Put this on the screen and say don't do that next time The pick n roll coverage is inexcusable tho. Like I don't understand how that ever was a thought, and how an adjustment was never made That makes me horny Rengel We'll be fine Adjust the pick n roll D. Take care of the ball and we're in this shit Game 2 is ripe for a win Hahahaha I'm 100% with you gunz So is tanking officially over?? I'm hoping his medicals scare everyone and Portland takes him at 25 ?Tighter pants: Ronaldo or josh Boyd? https://twitter.com/anthonyvslater/status/1128514221178671104?s=21 Spicy Terry Lmao I saw that too Rengel Marcus probably cumming himself ??Look at the difference in Bogut defending the pick & roll vs Kanter defending Idk if you can even call what Kanter is doing defense I think everyone in the universe except for Terry Stotts agrees on this He's played that same D for years tho Rengel. What makes you think he's gonna change now? Lol I wish I had some I don't get how dropping is even an option? What's moe gonna do to stop Steph in that situation? He still has to fight over a screen in no mans land Dude I disagree. If GS can hedge with Bogut, we can do the same with Kanter and Collins 100% Dubov When you go over the screen, you're still a step behind the shooter at best. You need the help defender to be close enough that the shooter pauses and the ball defender can catch up https://twitter.com/stevejones20/status/1128651243101085697?s=21 Dude he made the most uncontested 3's in playoff history. Lol that's absurd Really? Gimme more deets gundy Wow Told you man. I have images of Aminu standing at the free throw line while Steph hits pull up 3's burned into my brain Terry never should have came out with that coverage and that just makes me even more sure he ain't gonna change it Terry was super defensive post game when they asked him too Can you add him to the group text? 1000% ?Dame wasn't happy either Terry's been doing this for years man. It's completely inexcusable. Steph is the best shooter in history and you think you can just "force him into a midrange shot". FOH ?This is the 2016 playoffs. Look familiar? ?2017 playoffs. Sensing a theme? ?This is how we should defend it every time. He made a ridiculous shot here, but that was great D A. There's a middle ground between that and standing at the FT line
B. We could play Zach more But yes Kanter isn't ideal. That was vonleh yeah Yeah dame was v reckless going to the rim Jumping to pass and shit Houman who's winning your playoff challenge Yeah I mean I assume we won't turn the ball over that much, and Dame and CJ will shoot much better game 2. So if we can shore up the defense a bit, we'll be in good shape https://twitter.com/draftexpress/status/1128725369224335360?s=21 Wow crazy stat. Dame is the highest drafted player left in the playoffs amongst all stars Dame (6)
Steph (7)
CJ (10)
Klay (11)
Giannis (15)
Kawhi (15) (Minus the injured bums on GS) Lmao He's in that tier now Doesn't change the point tho Current all star level players fam cmon This ain't hard Collins not a star
Lopez not a star Bogut not a star Lol All stars means current all star level players Nobody is talking about Vince carter rn when they talk about all stars Any other qualifiers we should mention? Can I include draymond or no since he wasn't an all star this year? He could still lose tho. If the bucks win Space you could win too If the bucks win it's between you and I ?$20k to potentially die? I'm putting my number at $100k All I know is it's definitely gonna be more damage than a little wind knocked outta ya So mark you're taking the hit to the chest for $20k? Yeah hands behind your back just standing there while Wilder winds up like DK in smash bros You're fucked No way you just walk away after that Wait people are really saying Zion could go back to Duke so he doesn't have to play in New Orleans?? I hope he pulls an Eli Manning and demands a trade I want chaos And all the AD drama happening right now. It's easy to equate the two players and see things ending poorly for Zion as well If the AD stuff wasn't happening right now I don't think it'd be as bad Windy made a good point tho. He said Ainge has never gotten into bidding wars. That's not his style Good interview Rengel. Man first Damon now bonzi. We needa bring that team out in game 4 Maybe it'll give us the spark we need The doctor has spoken. Mark you is dumb 3 fouls?!! Kanter definitely went to McKay Meyers went to Sprague Haha I was waiting for that Dame went to McKay too cmon Did anyone catch Jennifer saying she's been a Warriors fan since 2014 Was best friends with Xavier cannefax Layman definitely went to McNary I officially have a boner Dylan get the lines ready for halftime! Let's go!!! Dame fucking dolla God Aminu haha What a fucking half tho. Great work boys Gundy text Terry and tell him to keep it up! Meyers is the only guy on the team with a negative +/- https://twitter.com/sportstalkbarry/status/1129209165967237120?s=21 Dylan is that you? Beadle has never heard 3J before? Real knowledgeable host Kanter outlet to Aminu Can't draw that one up Well fuck 4th quarter Meyers baby Meyers was shitting his pants on that 3 Back to hating Olshey: bell would look real good off the bench for us right now instead of Skal glued to the bench Did Meyers wife commandeer Gundy's phone Seth! Jesus Christ Dame needed to help on that Dame ?? Omg ?Me every time Jordan bell scored Gundy Did you fall an hit your head last night I'll throw Meyers a bone. That last pick n roll with curry and draymond wasn't really his fault. Every warriors players went deep in the left corner, and have the entire right side of the court for Steph to string out that pick n roll Blazers have to help on that Yep We can't give up 3 pointers on second chance points. That's debilitating After the missed Looney box out, Klay hit a 3. Then the rebound Aminu fumbled out of bounds in front of the warriors bench, they inbounded to Steph for 3 https://www.instagram.com/p/BxkQC2hl5pM/?igshid=1lud3ieicdxb6 How has he only shot 79 free throws in 3.5 years is the better question Harden shoots that in one series Wow. Sign me up for that Lol space what do you think AD actually fetches? I'm thinking it comes down to LA or NY But remember he's on a one year deal I actually think LA has more leverage now than they did during the season Well now that their 1st is #4 instead of a late lotto pick. And AD only has 1 season left versus 1.5 Idk I feel like they could get him for something like Ingram, Kuzma and #4 And I don't think Boston will be a player. Ainge doesn't like bidding wars, he didn't want PG on a one year deal, and if kyrie leaves there's no point in trading their young talent I forgot about that. I mean honestly the play is just sell the house for AD, try to sign a big FA. Fuck the young talent when you have lebron Even if they got a tier 2 guy like Kemba to pair with lebron and AD they'd be in good shape Or maybe a D-Lo reunion lol NYK could also trade #3, Knox, Robinson, Dennis Smith and they have two unprotected picks from the Mavs I'm calling it now. It ain't happening I don't even think they'll make a serious offer. If Kyrie leaves there's no reason to trade for AD correct? Kyle Kuzma is pretty dope actually Gundy I'm sorry I love Zach, but giving him credit for playing sporadically in playoff wins is equivalent to Olshey touting us being the youngest team in the league by having 3 19 year olds on the bench Success by association I agree there! Boston ain't doing a deal You heard it in the liga first space Kevin Knox, Mitchell Robinson, Dennis Smith, #3 (RJ Barrett) and a future unprotected first from Dallas Blows our trade outta the water Kemba is a FA Can't combine players in a S&T How about Gary Harris, Millsap, MPJ and a 1st Jalen Rose is calling Phoenix the winner in a wild card move They could trade Ayton, Bridges, Josh Jackson and they're first What's funny is Phoenix had a chance to trade Bledsoe and #4 (josh Jackson) for Kyrie and passed lol Whoa what kinda drugs was Tyreke doing Crazy that they take blow so seriously I'd never be able to play in the nba Despite the obvious lack of talent Holy shit that's incredible Oregon Heroes ?Taking that shit to heart Gundy when does all nba come out ?"Sounds like a blast!" ???? Just put it on the credit card dude it's like it's free Thats a worry for another day CJ is getting his nails done on sportscenter right now I actually like the raptors Worst mascot ever was the bobcats Looked like a d league team They just needa move the pelicans to Seattle ?Look at what the other options were Wind lol Meyers Aka Jason Kidd I honestly am shocked meyers Leonard is starting the the western conference finals lmao Fuck that guy. I hate local writers trolling for clicks ?Ready to run thru a brick wall Lol I thinks it's like a Navy Seal code or something. Cuz Meyers is totally a seal https://twitter.com/marcjspearsespn/status/1130446291476000768?s=21 Wow Dame killed the tradition smh Okay but the fact the players have been going there since 84 is cool. It's the nostalgia factor Pip definitely tipped him to write that Magic is just dragging pelinka right now haha this is great drama Magic is a national treasure Damn. That blows He's a 2nd round projection isn't he? I'm Fucking crying hahaha That was cringe inducing haha Dude could barely even get the question out he knew it was so disrespectful Great content for gundy tho Holy shit haha Someone on twitter said Meyers is our Nick Collison. And he's gonna get his number retired lmao Haha holy shit so true We have the most embarrassing retired numbers. The whole 77 squad got their numbers retired just cuz we won a ship Dave Twardzik: 9/3/3 - 280 games
Larry Steele: 8/3/3 - 610 games 
Bobby Gross: 9/4/3 - 486 games Brandon Roy played more games with Portland than Walton or Lucas. Might as well retire his LA will get 12 retired Can we retired 30 for Sheed since we already retired it twice? Why not make it 3 Retire his number!!! Keanon Lowe trucked the shit outta me in high school. D1 players hit different Meyers 50 piece?! I'm buying a Meyers jersey rn Terry has been holding him back this entire time! Meyers chants This is unreal I never thought I would hear this Meyers trade value is gonna be at an all time high this summer Just like Neil drew up Pelinka is gonna be looking for a stretch 5 for Lebron I think we could part with Meyers for Lonzo Deja vu 17 to 8 in one minute Dope ? Meyers game winner. It's only right Let's go Give it to Meyers off the pick n pop I mean that was a clear travel Dylan lol I am surprised they didn't call a foul on stephs layup tho Which supports your game 5 point Fuck fuck fuck Completely worthless Omg this is gonna be another one of those replays Warriors ball Dame 3? I'm thinking Hood game winner Good call mark Man what a season tho. Proud of this squad ??? Aminu and Hood are staying IMO Let curry and Kanter walk We can pay Aminu whatever the market dictates. Hood I think the max we can pay is like 6 mil but I doubt anyone offers more than that Nurkic will be back in February wait for it If we get Blake griffin we're going to the finals Guys you know who we really don't need. Harkless ?Dame dropping hints ???? What! Brandon is the best character How's Emmett gonna run the food truck by himself Two deflating stats for your Tuesday morning 

1. Warriors are the first team to overcome a 15+ point deficit in 3 straight playoff games 
2. Blazers led for more minutes than the Warriors this series Didn't the spurs dick slap us in 99 too And Damon said no team with Avery Johnson as their pg could win a championship lol But then we came back as a favorite the next year. And hopefully the parallels stop there God dammit Rengel hahaha Didn't Elliot just comeback from a kidney transplant or something too? Or was that after that series What's sad is how quickly that team was dismantled. We go to back to back conference finals then trade Steve Smith, Jermaine, Bonzi and BG for Derek Anderson, Dale Davis, Wes Person and Shawn Kemp And the magic was gone Damn. Sad day space. That's a dope show https://twitter.com/chrisbhaynes/status/1130849145109880836?s=21 Blazer 4 life When does Meyers get his supermax? Worth it CP3 is getting 45 mil at 36 years old. It's the new nba And Dames shooting will age his game v well Wait would he leave for another team? And longer deal Or is his contract up I mean terry has his warts. Buts there's not really a better option Unless they elevate Vanterpool Is this a Toronto dwane Casey situation. Great team but need a new coach to get to the next level Well I picked the Bucks and he picked the Warriors. So that's the tie breaker It's a fair question dehaan haha Giannis turned down money on his current extension to save cap room. CJ meanwhile did not He should just take $35 mil a year and call it a day. Stop being greedy dame I just tell em cut the check Straight cash homie But yeah for real it's super easy for us to tell them to take less money but they're making so much it's not a major lifestyle difference Durant took 10 mil less this year to win Only by like 2 mil gundy What's he make from adidas and Hulu? Prolly like 10-12 million? Oh no I was saying he's only taking a 2 mil pay cut per year right now. Idk what his extension would be next year It cracks me up how many casual fans are ripping the blazers for getting swept. If they watched any games they'd know we shouldn't be there. We were playing with house money I'm not a moral victory guy but context matters. Put some respekt on dames name Yeah we definitely should have won at least one of those games probably 2. But still I can't get myself to be that angry at them I agree gunz I wonder if we could get a serviceable player with 2 years on his deal for ET. From a team that just wants cap space the following summer Yeah Brock everyone signed the 4 year deals in 2016 lol so not a huge advantage there That theoretical trade partner could have Crabbe or Bazemore instead Memphis is so dumb for not trading him earlier lol https://twitter.com/nuggetsnews/status/1130906063299997696?s=21 Am I missing something here? Why the hell would they pick up a team option? Can't they just decline it and workout like a 3 yr 40 mil or something He isn't worth close to that Yeah but they'd have his bird rights. They could decline and re-negotiate Just seems odd for Milsap to have that much leverage. I can't imagine any other teams wanting to pay him that much Oh baby You gonna text him our congrats? ?This shit is so lazy lol our season didn't end in demoralizing fashion. We were never beating the warriors Except we were never gonna win a 7 game series Such lazy click bait journalism How did nobody write about this being justification that dame and Cj can work together and win? Should be the standard sentiment but would make for a great contrarian take with all these losers still saying break it up Yeah ask if you can hold the bag Yeah I think 4/30 or something for Aminu would be clutch gunz And then Hood for 3/19 if he'd take it Kanter and Curry are prob gone Fair point dehaan He was terrible Cap enthusiast chad here All we got is the taxpayer mid level which is 6 mil with 5% annual raises. Can offer 4 years total I think we offer the full thing to Hood Sign Aminu with bird rights cuz it's free money like y'all said Then fill out the rest of roster with minimums I agree gundy Maybe do 3/20 with a player option if he kills it he can opt out And Dubov I can't see a huge market for Aminu. I feel like 8 mil is his ceiling. But all it takes is one shitty GM to set the market lmao Someone could give him 12 and fuck us ?Here's the deets next year BAE might get us another Curry type guy this summer but that also hard caps us for the year Just met with Derrick White's trainer. Your boy may be coaching at the Derrick white skills camp next month I'm trying man! He's inviting me to some shoot arounds to make sure I know my shit first. Just had coffee today Hahahaha I'm dying Thanks dude! Maybe text terry and see if he has any tips on what brand of whistle to buy? Maybe some good coaching sayings to sound like I know what I'm talking about Dame got an all defense vote lol Irrational blazer take of the day from BlazersEdge: "let's trade Turner, Meyers, Trent and a 1st for Blake Griffin" I'm sure Detroit is all over that one ?Is there a worse cap sheet than the Cavs? Lol that's a luxury tax team next season All nba teams are announced later today let's go Dame over Curry is closer than people think. That said I still think dame gets 2nd team Steph, Harden, Giannis, PG, Embiid
Dame, Kyrie, KD, Kawhi, Jokic
Russ, Beal, Lebron, Blake Griffin, Gobert That's my guess Yeah that's the biggest question. Could go either way If you take Lebron off then you drop all the way to Aldridge He did average 28/9/8 tho. Only question is did he play enough games All the other drama is irrelevant Lol true Definitely For forwards it's literally lebron or Lamarcus If you'd rather have 21/9 Lamarcus then sure But lebron still put up massive numbers I think the all star game shouldn't matter about positions. I like the 24 best players regardless of conference. But I feel like all nba kinda needs those parameters Center is kinda outdated tho. It should be 2 guards and 3 front court like the ASG does Idk Dylan I guess I just see the all nba teams as the three best teams you can make from the seasons performances. And if you just had 5 guards on one team that doesn't seem right Where as the asg should reward the 24 best players regardless of position since it's just a stats award anyways He's being facetious lol Suck it Dubov The fix is in tho. Klay didn't get picked so the warriors can keep the team together Lol dude 27/9/8 Speaks for itself Steph made it playing 51 games last year Were you mad about that? Kemba didn't make the playoffs Consistent outrage is needed Dubov Lol that video of Klay finding out he lost 30 mil Hear me out. League wanted him to miss (so warriors could keep him on a more affordable contract)

and Kemba to make it (so Jordan couldn't afford him and he goes to NY when he isn't offered the super max) The fix was in Have we seen the last of KD in a warriors jersey? He may never play for them again ?Also crazy to me that Kyrie only has 2 all nba nods. And worse career stats than dame. Yet people think Kyrie is so much better I feel like I'm the LaMarcus Aldridge of wedding festivities. I'm never gonna be a unanimous pick, but you get towards the end of the list and you're like hmm yeah he's good enough to round us out Suffice to say I was surprised I got invited to this wedding but I'll be at the bar with Mark Kawhi winning the ship then going to the clippers would be such a kawhi move https://twitter.com/profspiker/status/1131713035993788416?s=21 Is this guy just tryna be a hardo? Lol windy ain't gonna out his sources or he won't get anymore https://twitter.com/blazermb/status/1131778285573103616?s=21 Mike Barrett and Terry are drinking buddies?? Gundy did you get the invite? That's cold blooded. Do we think Mike Rice got the invite? ?I still can't look at this pic without dying laughing lmao Wow raptors Me and space are done If was a hot take Wait Dubov You know ray palonco? That's baller. I follow him from afar Dudes a sneaker legend Dame hanging with a boogie gives me life Anyone on the rockets we want? Morey going full fire sale How bout CJ for Harden straight up Who would he want on Portland is the question Meyers for Tucker? 3 point shooting unicorn big man cmon Easy Brock, it's called momentum Oh baby its official I'll be coaching at Derrick Whites camp in Denver June 24th-27th Trying to decide what nba coach I wanna model my coaching style after Ooooh good call gundy Does anybody think AD could actually stay? Or is this still just a leverage play by Griff That would be the save of the century if they could resign him Honestly their cap situation isn't even bad. They'd have max room next summer and could add to AD, Zion, Jrue and Julius Randle ?Starting 5 and sixth man who you got Lol space you didn't follow the one rule I'd go Magic, Jordan, Lebron, KG, Kareem with jerry west off the bench I think jerry west won in defeat if I recall correctly I agree gunz Blake should be our top target Wild card move: Dame and CJ recruit Jimmy Butler hard this summer. He gets the sixers to sign and trade him here Did y'all see Ric Bucher reporting that Kyrie is deciding between the Lakers and Nets? I think Jimmy is gone Yeah also idk why the kings do that But why would they want expirings if they could just let Harrison expire Dude died too Great reference Dubov The Fast series is a close 2nd behind Shooter in my all-time best movies list Wow I just looked up Wahlberg movies coming out and the first one was a doozy. "Wahlberg plays the father of a 15 yr old openly gay sophomore who took his own life after being bullied in high school, and struggling for acceptance from those around him" That's not Shooter 2.0 that's for sure Lol they're Jordan brand boys Cam it's being produced by VisionChaos and Jake Gyllenhaal is a producer lol ?Team Jordan Russillo is the man He seems like it. Total mans man Zach Lowe is also the man. Definitely not a bro but he's like the nerdy analytics guy in our friend group https://www.instagram.com/p/ByGqjI7gSot/?igshid=1nq9zz4mrmalx Meyers got his dog on a diet so he doesn't kill that one too Siakam is a beast Doris looking like a snack Next on first take: is Siakam a superstar? Rengel 1:38 left in the 3rd. Doris still looking hot Anybody else surprised Nick Nurse is 51? I thought he was some brad Stevens young buck 106-94 4:42 left 9 point lead 2:35 to play bunk Nah this is perfect for KD. He comes back in game 3 when they're down 0-2 and wins the series for the warriors. He's the hero. Rides off into the sunset with some dignity Yeah he played. Looked real slow God that Gasol trade mid season was so money They didn't give up shit for him Jonas and a couple warm bodies Masai has some fuckin balls Raptors win by 9 A fan in a Dell jersey was talking shit to Steph as he left Are you going to a bachelorette party? Or are you headed to Portland for Bakkens wedding? East is top heavy When you have under .500 teams making the playoffs don't tell me the conference is better If you wanna say the east has more contenders, sure that's an accurate statement Fair point When you say the east is better you're talking about the entire conference The Kings would beat the pistons and magic easy Well Jokic is gonna finish 3rd in MVP voting. They ain't trash Space and I were the only ones to pick against the warriors don't forget Bandwagon is full sorry ?Guys this is so SF it hurts

1. TV on top of the fridge cuz no apartments have living rooms
2. Not watching the warriors in the finals but probably has "Go Dubs" in his Instagram bio Siakam > Giannis https://www.instagram.com/p/ByHOEADFFxL/?igshid=1220b6cnmdo85 Did anyone read the Iggy article by Bucher today? It was pretty interesting. He said basketball isn't fun for any of them right now He said it feels like the Olympic team. They have to win or it's a failure https://www.instagram.com/p/ByISEkwh6vr/?igshid=1npwvkzg68kv1 I think so Dehaan. Unless they use it to trade ET and resign some of the free agents we have That would be epic https://www.instagram.com/p/ByQ2f41plUS/?igshid=x79a4wvvi07q I don't understand this. Why would you ask a dude to prom It makes zero sense haha. Like you really showed her bro! Brought a huge dude with you instead Yeah like wouldn't you ask a female celebrity? Wait so kawhi is staying? He bought a house? In there defense that's better than my gpa in college and I turned out alright https://instagram.com/fox46nick?igshid=1p0ew16ujgs08 Have you guys seen the weather man that copies pro athletes swag? Great content https://www.instagram.com/p/ByS7VmAnZ_s/?igshid=1d7zbxaaecku What's our best AD offer? CJ Harkless and picks? I can't think of anyone. Unless Tatum is on the table and they want potential over current talent Yeah but I think his potential is still sky high Sophomore slump If you can pair two top 10 players in their prime you gotta roll the dice I think we gotta include CJ or Nurk. They need a blue chip in the trade PG and Kawhi on 1 year deals both fetched all stars Omg Hahahaha 45 seconds in grandma was like fuck this just let me die here Those are boomin! Who was it that said he'd be a first ballot HOFer? They need their credential pulled Oh no wait it was Evan Turner hahaha https://twitter.com/thekidet/status/1135390853868994560?s=21 https://twitter.com/thekidet/status/1135390853868994560?s=21 God I love this chat. I put my phone down for 2 hours and come back to 300 texts My summary 

Dylan loves Tucker Carlson 
Space and I have the same opinion of draymond 
Gundy is drinking the blazers kool aide but I respect it 
Houman is on acid Yeah the warriors are gonna have so many excuses this summer Dude with boogie they still have 3 all stars out there haha. And 1 of them is the only unanimous MVP in league history! Like cry me a fucking river Jesus I think it depends who fills the 2 spot for us Dylan. But I completely agree with your assessment that the drop off from draymond to Aminu is much greater than CJ to Eric Gordon "Kyle Lowry has played phenomenal this series, but he's an even greater guy off the court. Couldn't happen to a better person" -Oliver Zach Lowe said the raptors could be the strangest assembled champions ever. They got Kyle Lowry from Houston for a draft pick. Ibaka in a salary dump. Gasol at the trade deadline. Kawhi and green on a 1 year rental Hail Mary trade. Then all their role players with shrewd drafting in the late 20's I heard kawhi could sign a 1 or 2 year deal if they win Jesus Christ he did not Unanimous mvp and 3 all stars. Spare me the pity Also is it just me or did it seem like Danny Green was an unnecessary throw in to the kawhi deal? Nobody was talking about it like he wasn't gonna be a plug and play 2 guard and I feel like San Antonio didn't need to include him They could put patty mills in his spot for salary That's some Jedi magic bunky Also, how did OG miss the entire playoffs with an appendicitis and Boogie came back from a torn quad? Houman do you even follow the nba OG Anounoby Lebron hit the buzzer beater bank shot over him last year Shrooms are legal in Denver now. I'm flying right now Gundy I'm dying at that RT lmaoooo I was at the chiropractor tonight and he just casually starts telling me about the blow he did in New Orleans last weekend I've only met the guy twice What the fuck was that question "You scored 109 when you won and then you scored 109 when you lost. Does that mean you need to play better defense?" You're a basketball writer?? Bring him home What are they trading for AD? Seems highly unlikely but I like the idea S&T are incredibly rare Gundy stop But for real who is gonna make a serious offer outside LA? I still think Ainge sits this one out LA surprisingly has more leverage now. They can reduce their mid season offer. They're bidding against themselves There's gotta be a kawhi type deal out there. They need to find a B level all star rather than a collection of average players CJ and Collins is better than the Nets package Idk gundy I'm kinda in the opposite camp. I'd take a 3rd high level player I would only trade CJ for AD Outside that I'm hoping for Blake or maybe Love for scraps Honestly Knicks would probably throw in frank for Dennis Smith to get that done too Frank OR Dennis Smith I still think Phoenix could be a wild card. What about Ayton, Josh Jackson and 6 Lonzo's one year of lucky shooting in college is still mesmerizing. People were giving him Steph curry range Take away his shooting and he loses a ton of luster Great point space Don't forget the Monty Williams angle and Sarver being hungry for talent now And the Booker AD Kentucky connection Don't you think Chicago could snag someone with similar potential as Lonzo at 7 tho? And have 2 extra years on their rookie deal Idk why they'd be clamoring to do that Yeah I agree. Chicago ain't doing that Except lonzo ain't he helping a contending team lol He's booty I like that take Space is def more of a bucks fan than heat fan now Fuck Vanterpool is leaving us https://www.instagram.com/p/ByYYQ_qA-Hq/?igshid=1duo29mnaysa0 Fuck Great work Neil! Couldn't just double his salary? Smh https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1136731760887308288?s=21 Da fuck I'm really confused on what to think of this I guess Atlanta wins this but Prince is pretty dope. I feel like you hope you get a player his caliber at 17. So they just did this for the extra pick next year? Atlanta ate a shit ton of money Prince only makes like 3 mil. But it's only one season Brooklyn is just swinging for the FA fences this summer Idk I guess if I'm Brooklyn it's not as bad as I first thought. They weren't gonna get a player as good as prince right now at 17. So basically they just traded Crabbe and a first next year to dump his salary That'd be like us trading ET and a first right now to dump him which wouldn't be shocking. And we wouldn't even be able to sign a significant player with that room like the nets can Damn Kyrie and KD in Brooklyn would be kinda sick They couldn't do Kyrie and KD, and trade D lo To sign both those guys they'd have to renounce d lo's rights Yeah they could do that Except IIRC you can't add players to a sign and trade So it would have to be D Lo and picks for AD. Nets couldn't add anyone else This reminds me of a heated debate I had with jake Logan when he said hockey players are better athletes than nba players Gundy what's a Love trade look like in your book?? Meyers trade value is at an all time high Gotta cash out when we're hot Lol sure did Yeah I'm not sure what they were going for there https://twitter.com/thehill/status/1137154288055201793?s=21 Wtf lol I'm in gundy. CJ for AD 2020 I would do Jimmy if we add him to dame and CJ I would rank my semi realistic wish list 

1. Blake
2. Jimmy 
3. Love West coast best coast Top heavy east But raptors are fucking legit So are bucks Masai is a god damn oracle No GM in the league had the balls to fire the fucking coach of the year then trade for a 1 year rental But Masai did RIP to the ringzzz era It's all about branding and happiness Marijuana is a gateway drug Space remember when I told you if you did Molly you might start doing heroin Such a naive chap I was. Both are great ?Uglier shot than his brother https://twitter.com/hgomez27/status/1137900239678058496?s=21 Pelicans are asking for an all star, player with all star potential, and two first round picks for AD CJ, Zach and two firsts?? Not this year but we could trade this years and 2021 I like all of it except the trade dame part Keep him even if we suck Achilles? Or calf again https://twitter.com/omaroneynba/status/1138267246625558528?s=21 You tell em oliver! https://www.instagram.com/p/ByjYdOEF8Wl/?igshid=kokk3evsxfjv That's his Achilles snapping up his leg That was fast This is epic Wowwwwww Terrible shot That's crazy that Lowry shot could've won a championship at the buzzer tho Fine line between hero and goat Never rooting for the warriors sorry I'd rather listen to space gloat than steph My boss was visiting from SF today and he's a classic casual sports fan aka huge warriors fan. He had the gall to say that Toronto fans were too cocky and should show some humility Dude don't do this space. Warriors fans are the worst in sports I hate the warriors/fans almost as much as I love the blazers It's a personal vendetta Yeah 4 years of that just drove me off the edge haha Who's the most likable fan base? Spurs? https://twitter.com/shamscharania/status/1138297712112066560?s=21 Who's the fuck that told KD to play Whoaaaaaa Shots fired Hmmmm might be the move Wow! Book it ?Simons getting those sauce town cuts S/O McKay Gundy don't hit me with that reverse logic Neil just says that's a sign he's working a deal lol It's gonna come out after he's traded to NY that Portland was in consideration but they wouldn't part with one key asset And it's just gonna be another moral victory talking point on Olsheys belt I accidentally spelled my name CHad in an email to a customer today, and now I think I'm gonna adopt the schoolboy q swag and just capitalize the H every time Too bad nobody wears condoms in 2019 https://twitter.com/cbsdenver/status/1139302194874732544?s=21 What a turn of events for this guy So if Kyrie is for sure going to Brooklyn where is Deangelo going As a FA or S&T? Can't remember if they have cap room I don't think so space And I love the draft I didn't know that rule That's game changing Space I'm offended you think the liga is gonna die down. Basketball never stops So if Klay and KD are both out for basically the whole season, where does golden state end up? Like a 4 seed? https://twitter.com/sinow/status/1139547306548764674?s=21 True Also what's KD's performance gonna be like? Nobody has gotten even close to full form after an Achilles tear You saw how well that worked out for Boogie I hope he goes to NY Why doesn't Kyrie just go join lebron and AD in LA? They'd win the west easy Gundy what about a S&T for Tobias Harris? If he says he's gone and wants to come to Portland They recoup some assets https://twitter.com/danwolken/status/1139555306889854976?s=21 https://www.instagram.com/tv/Bysntadh6mw/?igshid=l0bzspbindc4 This was dope Holy shit Nice haul griff I mean who's the all star in the trade? CJ is better than all them Thursday mark Add Randle to the mix and they're just the 2018 lakers plus holiday and Zion lol Oh true Garland would be nasty Griff has said he wants a mix of young talent and vets to make the playoffs this year tho So I think holiday stays I'm actually a fan of the hybrid approach of late twenties studs and young guys versus completely bottoming out Lebron doesn't wanna play second fiddle to the Klaw tho How about a return of D-Lo to the lakers? Kyrie going to the Nets Kemba should go to the Knicks with KD. Kyrie to the Nets. D-Lo to the Lakers. Kawhi to the clippers Josh Hart is dope. Jodie Meeks just got a ring anything is possible Wow great question Brock Zion is a star too tho Lol Zion is a HOFer already book it Blake just put up 25/8/5 in year 10 What's your point I'm calling it right now. Russel is gonna go back to LA and Kyrie signs with the Nets If the clippers can trade Gallinari they could sign two max players Kawhi and Jimmy or Kawhi and Klay would be dope Why not Brock I think Kemba stays east Why not? The only blocker was magic after he trashed Russell and he's gone It's a new regime in LA. No hard feelings Who's our targets Blake and Love? I still think a Tobias S&T could be a sleeper if dame can recruit him Think about this. Tobias tells philly "I'm leaving but I really wanna go to Portland if y'all wanna recoup some assets. They don't have cap room"

Portland trades Moe, Meyers and a first and second for Tobias. 

Philly gets two bodies for depth and a first round pick for a guy who was leaving anyway. Moe and Meyers both have 1 year left so it's low risk if they suck Dame and CJ? Idk lol Oh I feel you. But maybe the tides are turning The extension wouldn't kick in until next season so it wouldn't affect cap room this summer But if they strike out this summer on a third star, they could do 1 year deals again and sign one next summer. Then extend AD Hence the waiting Also AD probably wants to wait and see what the squad can do. Win win for player and team Pelicans might trade #4?! For what Disgruntled second tier player? I read Griff wants playoffs year 1 What if he did #4, Randle and others for Beal or something https://ftw.usatoday.com/2017/06/lakers-magic-johnson-lonzo-ball-retire-jersey-nba-draft #tbt He's just trolling But could happen Phoenix would be a good spot for him Zach is the AD stopper A modern day Ruben Patterson https://twitter.com/bobbymarks42/status/1140096513185595392?s=21 Wait there was unprotected pick swaps 6 years from now? Lol Lakers r dum Is there an echo I feel like they were unnecessary tho. Bidding against themselves at that point Brooklyn 2.0 Couldn't they protect the pick swaps? You think griff walks away if they protect them? ?More riveting analysis from Maroney Lol That's like 15 years for you. I could see that https://www.instagram.com/p/ByxoNZmDpou/?igshid=1tj4t7cbrcfta I'm here with fun guy ?? Are they all Fucking stupid What is going on This is absurd. So only AD wins in this scenario And only partially cuz he loses out on an all star teammate That's what I'm saying gundy is AD is the only winner keeping his bonus Pelicans lose space
Lakers lose space
AD gets $4 mil He wanted out from NO and got it, and now he's gonna sabotage their chances to be better? He's bout to make $200 mil+ on his extension and probably makes $15 mil a year in endorsements Give up the $4 mil dollar bonus you pussy Short answer, yes. But I agree with your point Bron and AD is pretty much equal to steph and KD Now they gotta find their Klay Or maybe just get Klay Btw happy Father's Day Dylan. I apologize for making a degrading joke about Sage I think he's got at least 3 years of 25+ ppg in him Lol mandatory pick swap would be a hell of gamble Houman we just made the WCF what is it gonna take for you to show an ounce of optimism We're gonna win a ship

Houman: "I'm still not sold on this team until they prove they can repeat. Who says this wasn't a fluke?" There was this guy named OG that woulda been nice for that gundy smh I wanna make fun of him but it's really not a hard name to pronounce Hell yeah. Need me one of those American made baby Are people really now just learning that Damon was Toronto's first draft pick and won ROY? https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1140689068885532673?s=21 S/O to Neil for turning RHJ into Nurkic Shut up https://www.instagram.com/p/By0v_rLjS-C/?igshid=ywz9s9vhok5b In lighter news, kawhi is actually funny Omg Make it happen Then Neil can spin 2016 summer as a win "We don't make this deal if I didn't sign so many shitty contracts that summer ? We're gonna be doing so many lines next season Dylan ?CP's comment lol How would we get him lol Horford would be amazing here But I like the love Atlanta 3 way idea What does Atlanta gain out of that? They basically traded 

8 + 17 for 5
Crabbe + 10 for 25? And our shitty players They already have 8, 10 and 17 They could trade 8 and 17 and move up to 5 Or 8 and 10 and keep 17 Cleveland makes out like bandits basically getting #10 for Love and getting off his money ? I think it'd have to be something like:

Atlanta gets
ET
Meyers
#5

Cleveland gets
Crabbe
#8
#17
#25

Portland gets
Love Atlanta keeps 10 And I want a supermodel lol If that's a deal breaker than so be it. But I would never do that if I'm Atalanta https://twitter.com/giannis_an34/status/1141144781684445185?s=21 Is Middleton really a max guy? Holy shit Thats where everyone was expecting him to go tho Another west team gets better. Your move Neil They already had Rubio who wasn't terrible. So it's not a massive jump from last year Not like they had Steve Blake out there Clearly they're different players Houman I'm just saying he was an above average pg Mitchell > Zach Collins Let's hope so. We don't need another west juggernaut Gundy Dubov wager Let's see it Love it And gundy that's what I tell my lady too 20 guys?! That's absurd Maybe 15 I wouldn't call harden or Brogdon pg's. And wall is out for the year But touch He's not a world beater ?Sick burn Meyers Were getting love Is that how you do it gundy Live Love Laugh I bet Meyers has that hanging in his living room somewhere Houman you may be the worst speller I've ever met It's impressive Not to be outshined by marks talent of making up last names of athletes https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/27009178/police-looking-man-brawl-youth-game This was 5 minutes from my house lol Well doctors are shit writers so I assume they're bad at spelling too. Which means you fit right in Lowe said Crowder could be had for 2 2nds. I'd take him over harkless This is what I envisioned happening to spaceman if he did Molly when I was a naive freshmen Lillard in space jam 2!! https://twitter.com/shamscharania/status/1141504094022045699?s=21 https://twitter.com/bleacherreport/status/1141520440726183937?s=21 Come again? They're gonna turn down Kyrie? I love the nba Otto would be amazing. I'd be hesitant on two firsts tho Maybe one of those heavily protected ones that turns into two 2nds if it doesn't convey year one I think we make that same trade for Love. Then trade two 2nds for Crowder I saw it on twitter yeah. Don't know how valid it is tho Trading ET for nothing doesn't do anything for us except save tax dollars So I would not do that I don't think so Brock We'd have to renounce Aminu in that case So if we wanna lose Aminu and Turner and the 25 pick and replace him with a MLE guy. That'd be the choice Yeah the taxpayer MLE on a 3 year deal with raises isn't bad at all I hope Hood takes it Mark that's a question as old as time itself I'm with gundy. Use 25 for a K Love trade I was gonna say the Lakers if they get desperate. But Hood won't go back with Lebron so they're out Holy shit Mark you're right But I think that was PA's call He loved him a white Actually Brock I take that back. If we renounced Hood instead of Aminu, and trade ET for nothing I think we get to the full MLE So if we're losing Rodney anyway, that could be a move. Assuming we have a target for the MLE He spit on his grave gundy! What's your guys thoughts on Roberson? Versus Harkless True. Missed a whole season which is risky Alright gundy what's your official blazers big board tonight Okay I like Grant I kinda like Matisse. Or Brandon Clarke if he falls Gundy what about Mr double dribble himself Ty Jerome if he's still there. Could play the ET role off the bench Yeah wings win games. I agree Brock He's a shooter and ball handler at 6'5 Virginia PG I got my poor mans Donovan Mitchell guy too Talen Horton-Tucker. 6'4 bully with 7'1 wingspan Played at Simeon HS Good thing mike rice isn't here cuz he wouldn't be able to pronounce that If our son Bol Bol drops, are we taking him? I see a Robert Williams/Jared Sullinger esque drop in play with that foot injury Lol wait who died They said who Ainge drafted Oh shit I forgot he died That's ruthless haha Givony just called Grant Williams a paul Milsap clone Guys tonight's the night we round out the big 3 Kevin Love is coming home Yeah let's be honest guys, we're totally fucked. But until then I'm gonna live in fantasy land and think good thoughts Somebody call me in 6 hours to make sure I haven't jumped off the edge yet God bob Sarver is such a cheap fuck Defense is below average but he's a certified bucket getter And he randomly developed a 3 point shot last year I saw a guy take his coffee into the bathroom the other day Fucking psychopath Intros for he green room lmao who's idea was this Pretty soft if you ask me I wanna see one of them slide to the 40's A la Majec Lampe When league fits starts saying he's gonna win drip rookie of the year I realize I know nothing about style I agree he looks ridiculous I like RJ Cam is the wildcard Guys let's all remember some of the greatest analysis in sports history. Zion could be the best player in the draft, but don't be surprised if he isn't either Cavs going Sexton/Garland back to back lol great drafting Lmao Suns r so dum I'll take him 0-12 is pretty bad lol I like where this is going Great troll by the big dawg to start off the morning I also think lebron only made it on his physical attributes Jalen rose and Lavar needs get in the octagon and settle this Gundy we basically got OG now just 2 years late Let's hope we get McDonald's mvp Nassir Also I can't believe OG missed the entire championship run with an appendicitis. Rub some Fucking dirt on it God dammit. Real awkward office moment New guy was asking this try hard on my team about logging overtime hours. Of course the try hard gives him terrible advice. So I G-chat the kid and I'm like 

"yo don't listen to max, everyone logs 10 hours overtime a week even if we don't work it. It'll get approved"

Then I look over and the new guy calls over Max to have him help him. Max goes open your email. Then I'm staring at his computer like don't do it. Opens his email and my G chat is right there just talking mad shit about Max I'm like dawg, cover your fucking chat window better than that Jesus Its real awkward in here boys Blazersedge is saying we let Aminu walk now. Gotta preserve all our assets IMO Agreed 10 mil would be max I pay So if golden states does this delayed S&T with Durant, shouldn't we trade CJ for him? I wonder what a trade like that would look like Wow One shitty contract for another shitty contract Next summer Same length as ET ET hated Terry too didn't he Seems like a good move Basemore shot worse than Aminu from 3 last year Lol 32% is 32% Wow Woj already saying we won't be able to afford Hood back I'd take Hood over Kanter if I had to choose https://twitter.com/chriskirschner/status/1143254814010368009?s=21 When we get referred to as a contender ? https://twitter.com/spurs/status/1143222811118514176?s=21 "Headlined by coach Chad Butler" https://twitter.com/blazersbysagar/status/1143292495704416256?s=21 This is some Oliver Maroney esque analysis ET did literally nothing for us. This is about as low risk as they come ?Vlade got a vote lol Few people wear a suit better than magic Fire olshey. Picked CJ over the MVP ?Terry didn't get one vote?! ? Retired Kobe is the man. I'm here for all of it Steph ahead of Dame in mvp voting is garbage ?Here you go space I'm taking dames season all day Why Steph? Cuz he averaged 1 point more than dame Yes they are comparable Lol but steph got the nod on 1st team and way more mvp votes Russillo the goat just made the funniest analogy about forgetting Sarah Marshall and the AD trade 

AD is Sarah Marshall
Lakers are Russell Brand 
Pelicans are Jason Segal 
Zion is Mila Kunis Pelicans just got dumped by the star for Hollywood and then Zion aka mila kunis falls in there lap lol He also said he heard the blazers organization is buzzing about Simons this summer. Which probably means Neil is trying to shine another nickel to make a ridiculous trade offer Like Anfernee and Collins for Ad type offer That way he can have Woj say we were in the mix https://twitter.com/dwightjaynes/status/1143599916897296384?s=21 If Baze kills all of the Simons hope by taking his number he's gonna be more hated than Felton Anybody watching that Lowe woj report I forgot to tell you guys I got big timed by Derrick white today. I'm running a left hand layup station for these 6-10 year olds, and Derrick walks up and is like "nah man these kids can't make a left hand layup do it from the right side." And made all the kids switch sides I'm like oh yep sure definitely. Right hand it is Haha I'm not gonna front they were terrible. But the dude that's actually running the camp told me to do it cuz I double checked He's like "challenge em!" https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1143960727948058626?s=21 Lakers should just accept their fate they ain't getting a Max guy, and just take Capela and Eric Gordon for free I think so. But it sounds like if they fork over a first round pick it's a done deal We don't have cap space to absorb him. Maybe if we got a third team to take on harkless, and we gave them a pick and we get tucker https://twitter.com/chrisbhaynes/status/1144000294394552320?s=21 One contender and 2 scrubs I feel like that was a compliment to Randle Kobe's stats in both jerseys is kinda epic tho Almost identical. Could be HOF in their own I'm kinda surprised Kawhi is actually meeting with the Lakers Does lebron really wanna be a 3rd wheel? https://twitter.com/cbssportsnba/status/1144321026102374403?s=21 Alright guys camp wrapped today. We had 2 awards: team championship, and then team olympics where each team had to complete a series of drills/shots and then the team coach had to shoot a half court shot underhand to finish it. 

Your boy won 1st place in both. So I think I was the best coach of the camp Are Denver kids more disciplined than Portland kids is the question What a loser Simmons went way downhill for me when he started gargling KD's balls Arguably Maybe Tatum isn't as good as people thought and Hayward ain't the same player Since Nurk relies more on size and brute force over perimeter mobility and explosiveness.. I'm optimistic Yeah Hayward's was at the ankle George and Nurk had the same shin break Dr Houman weigh in Is Neil smarter than we all thought Of course they do But is that believed by others is the question Exactly Sounds like he's mentioning someone else. A scout or executive I just want Love or Blake. That's all I really hope kawhi stays east or this wide open west is gonna close quickly Wtf did I just watch haha https://twitter.com/shamscharania/status/1145037017153200129?s=21 ?? I wonder if we'd target a We$ return if a market for him doesn't materialize I could see him landing somewhere on a vet minimum deal I wonder what scary terry nets on the open market Does some team sign him as a starter? Phoenix? Indiana? On terry? 4 year / 50 mil Marcus smart got 4/52 Terry's better than him No I feel you 100% Like as a starting pg terry is in the bottom third. Smart gives you elite defense off the bench which is crucial Everyone said that. I googled it and she's 5'10 Not that tall unless you're Houman Houman if you aren't aware that's dame in the bottom right Yeah that was a fucking steal Myles turner makes like 19. Nurk is way better Meyers makes 11 lol Yeah 10 seems right. I'm afraid we let him walk Why the fuck would he wanna play there over philly https://twitter.com/shamscharania/status/1145397820410793984?s=21 KD to Brooklyn How did we not match that offer smh At least we got Hood back. We need scorers more than whatever Aminu does Get kanter back and another solid vet minimum guy and I'll be happy Yeah idk how we afforded that https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1145499428398215168?s=21 Wait what??? How did they have cap space for that Sixers are favorites in the east now They were way over the cap tho You don't just subtract jimmy and have all his space https://twitter.com/jwquick/status/1145464545713897473?s=21 Taxpayer mid level** but that makes sense. Good get Bazemore + Hood + Little > ET + Hood + Aminu https://twitter.com/dwightjaynes/status/1145502530073288704?s=21 Watch us get Javale or something lmao ?So this is the current squad. Kanter and Curry are probably goners. We need some solid vet min pickups in those spots. Then trade for Love Wes Mathews, Ed Davis, Javale Magee, Gortat, Richaun Holmes, RHJ, Justin Holiday could all be interesting Yeah I don't get that at all Dubov. Especially at 4 years. Maybe 2 But JA is the truth Corey Joseph or Wayne Ellington could be targets Booooooo He should have retired a blazer Fuck you neil I also love how Kyrie and KD were so bitchy with the media this season for "jumping to conclusions" about them wanting to play together cuz they kept having dinner, and were seen talking at the all star break etc... then that's exactly what they did -- joined forces It's almost like the media was doing their jobs https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1145519015818911744?s=21 Reminds me of the time I couldn't figure out if I should break up with my gf or not I think I asked her the same thing David griffin is fuckin acing this rebuild Lonzo / Elfrid Payton
Jrue / Reddick
Ingram / Josh Hart
Zion / Derrick Favors
Hayes / Dialo

That's a hell of a pivot off AD https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1145523960177713152?s=21 Layman probably gone then Still need backup pg and center Imagine if we got Curry back ?Imagine if we weren't paying 5 mil a year for players to NOT play for us Who's the winner of the day besides Brooklyn? Is it Utah? We can only give Kanter the minimum. He's gonna get offered more Olshey basically chose Hood over Kanter. We could have offered either the TPMLE Can't say I disagree with him I can't believe the warriors pulled that off Fuck them I kinda want Javale. Call me crazy Also why did the Knicks spend all their cap space on 3 power forwards I saw an interesting theory. Timberwolves and D-Lo still want each other, and Russell ain't gonna fit in GS long term but they needed an asset back. Wolves couldn't find trade partners to take back contracts to clear space to sign D-Lo, and D-Lo wasn't gonna wait around and watch the money dry up. 

So golden state gets Russell then waits 6 months til he's trade eligible and trades him to Minnesota for RoCo, Teague and a first. Balances out their roster more and Russell joins his boy Towns https://www.instagram.com/p/BzWdsn3hP59/?igshid=1wvnfztu4viy8 Gonna miss chief but I won't miss that catapult wind up from 3 I can't believe that contract Corey Joseph just got. And Reggie Bullock got more than Julius Randle last season lol I'm still hoping for Javale, RoLo or Richaun Holmes at center, and a vet PG for the min to replace Curry Then trigger the Love trade Oh fuck good call Gimme the one of the other 2 then Kanter has to at least get 5 mil from someone I would take him in a heartbeat but agree with Dubov Houman now is the time to go big We need a stud 4. Loves contract isn't even that bad Dame will be making 50 when Love is making 30 His contract also declines in the last year Kanter will be fine. All of the exceptions are bigger than the vet min we can offer https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1145729586019389442?s=21 Boom. Need a backup guard now Yeah good for Seth. That's a killer deal coming off 2 mil last year What the fuck That's not Kevin love I'm so confused rn Please talk us into this space At least Neil is doing stuff? I'll give him that Dame
CJ
Bazemore
Zach
Whiteside https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1145734254241964038?s=21 Woj: full time news breaker, part time blazers PR staffer Yeah I mean Moe and Meyers we're gone next summer. Whiteside can be as well. So pretty low risk move. 

I'm just bummed cuz Meyers and Moe were the Love trade pieces You're talking me into this Space!! I mean the fact that Meyers is gone is a win. If he was our starting center game 1 I would have jumped off a bridge https://twitter.com/chrisbhaynes/status/1145735015277330433?s=21 I'm loving the media member love lol. Haynes is on the payroll too tho Fair point space. He was the only guy ?Updated depth chart. We need more shooting Expect Neil to sign 3 19 year olds to drag down our average age so he can preach potential "Look were the youngest team in the league okay" Kanter been out dawg. We don't got money Neil is showing some balls tho. Just let go 2 starters from a 50-win 3 seed. He's always been a sit on your laurels guy Did you guys see the pic of Neil with dames family in Oakland lmao ? Hahahah shut up space Jazz and Nuggets will be legit Lakers if they get kawhi it's a wrap I mean it's wide open at the moment I agree there Mark how stoked are you for Whiteside? I feel like this is a move mark loves https://twitter.com/cocooconnell/status/1145737350506356737?s=21 I would be so pissed if Meyers was in the record books for most games played in Portland. Can't believe he lasted 7 years here Gundy what you think dawg?? We need another rangy wing off the bench Stotts got the most out of Nurk, Hood, Kanter, Aminu I got faith We literally just overhauled half our roster I'm fine with that. Take it slow big fella Let's bring Vonleh back And Utah https://twitter.com/thehoopcentral/status/1145735580317126656?s=21 More of this content 2 Lol https://twitter.com/thekidet/status/1145743913929625601?s=21 https://www.instagram.com/p/BzYecNzAIqi/?igshid=xw0jg87mc1zc https://twitter.com/shamscharania/status/1145749263160401923?s=21 Bring We$ back. Mend the fences Neil ?Still need a big man, athletic wing, and pg that can shoot All vet mins Dubov There's a lot of players and not a lot of space left How about an IT flyer Anthony Tolliver could be a good emergency big who can shoot Barea also has a torn Achilles ??More free agents I like Holmes a lot Kofous was CJ's high school teammate Tyus Jones would be perfect but Minnesota gonna pay him https://twitter.com/marcjspearsespn/status/1145767567434440705?s=21 Okay what the fuck Neil Also if Iggy gets bought out by Memphis, maybe he comes here? We're a contender now! https://twitter.com/shamscharania/status/1145774453223231489?s=21 Holmes is gone. Cauley-Stine may be available now I would've wanted Kanter and whiteside We also could still trade Whiteside later this season for Love or someone else https://twitter.com/blazersbysagar/status/1145776732110118913?s=21 Gundy this dude is so dramatic lol I'm all in on Iggy. Dame and CJ needa get on the phone Zach Lowe just said Whiteside could hold down the fort til February when Nurk comes back. Then we flip Whiteside for Love Nah everything I've read is expirings and picks is all it'll take for Love Gilbert is stubborn and still holding out hope for ticket sales etc. belief is maybe he comes back to reality by the trade deadline Whiteside, Little and 1 or 2 firsts to get off Loves deal seems like a win win for both sides ?Smh https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1145786801044500480?s=21 Shit Wes got the minimum. Too bad Neil burned that bridge https://www.instagram.com/p/BzYxqTSlRa5/?igshid=1lqctb4f9wywc It cost a first to absorb one year of harkless. And we didn't have to give it up. Win for us What money lol It's doable. We'd have to gut the team but could fill it with minimums I guess If we just kept 

Dame
CJ
Nurkic
Zach
Simons 
Little We could sign draymond to the max Fair but he's also one of the best defenders in the league. That's not a system I think he's at least worth what al horford just got 4/109. ~27 mil Draymond would be legit with dame Cj and healthy Nurk https://twitter.com/dame_lillard/status/1145811344651771906?s=21 Dammit Has anybody heard from the Thunder? Sam Presti hasn't done shit yet except sign Mike Muscala KD is so insecure lol https://twitter.com/chrisbhaynes/status/1145816889211277312?s=21 Woulda been perfect at the backup 4 Wonder what he secured 2/10 maybe? https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1145825046990151680?s=21 Who wanted pau? Rengel? Please no Board man is too good for the lebron side show Kawhi is so likable tho. Now I gotta hate him https://twitter.com/kendrickperkins/status/1145834992318197760?s=21 ?Jason Whitlock: Keeps ambassador Guys Maroney is on Twitter Live right now and he has 9 whole viewers Guys Jordan Bell got 1 year 1.6 million. Why didn't we sign him ?Receipts He's a good shooter Dehaan. Stretch 4. Still need a backup PG then I assume we keep Layman or grab a rangy veteran defender Isn't Dragic kinda washed Devin Harris, Raul Neto, Trey Burke, Mudiay, jerian grant, shelvin Mack could all be interesting PG options It's looking like Simons is gonna be the backup tho ?Updated https://www.instagram.com/p/Bza30pwA-LM/?igshid=iac3cdv6wt4r Kevin been posting a lot of Oregon love lately ?? That whiteside + Trent + 1st for Love trade in late January is gonna be great Ben Simmons gotta be the richest guard in nba history to not be able to shoot a 3 ?0-17 on his career lmao Hahahaha good luck space Damn Vonleh got the minimum too. I woulda rather had him or Bell over Tolliver Damn the jazz are filling out that roster nicely https://twitter.com/bobbymarks42/status/1146224117127012352?s=21 WCF team? Portland gonna be at like 43.5 lol Always gonna be underestimated ?Get this loser off my radio ?Suck on that space Is Trent gonna be good this year Saturday https://www.instagram.com/p/BzdfknIAw9o/?igshid=1qwvu8jjo6kf5 Great caption, even better shoes President of the Duck boot gang Lol if he keeps referencing shooter I might This whole Betsy Ross thing is so ridiculous Dylan how fired up is laura Ingram? I think Kap is the only one who finds it offensive https://twitter.com/trailblazers/status/1146459838429454337?s=21 Got a quarter chub right now Is anybody following this kawhi OJ chase right now I love free agency https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1146514603767152641?s=21 Lmao another suns top 5 draft pick bust Looks like he's headed to lakers sixers or bucks What was the point of that trade for Phoenix? Melton and Jackson are the best players in the trade Both them and 2 picks for Jevon Carter? I mean they do have 7 SF's but still The fact that they took Jackson over pairing De'Aaron Fox with Booker still blows my mind Maybe he just wanted to break up with them face to face 1+1 would be smart cuz then he can opt out for the 10 year max scale Dame needs to recruit better Lol suns have now let a top 5 pick walk cuz he sucked (Alex Len), used an 8th pick (Marquees Chriss) to dump Brandon Knights contract, and used a 4th pick (Josh Jackson) to dump salary to sign Ricky Rubio Truly superb drafting They also could have traded Bledsoe and the 4th pick (Josh Jackson) to the Cavs for Kyrie but turned them down Kyrie and Booker woulda been dope ?I'm just dunking on you all day Ian Hey guy chad here, 99.9% sure we get a trade exception for that. Should be 4 mil like Rengel said We'll have 12 months to use it. Neil didn't use the Crabbe or Vonleh ones tho I don't think you can combine the exception with a players contract. But whiteside for Love straight up still works. Just has to be within 125% of each other That's how we traded Meyers and moe (22 mil) for whiteside (27 mil) https://twitter.com/thecrossover/status/1146611607184773121?s=21 ?Lol I found the new Meyers guys ?This is what triggered him Hahahaha Guy is a loose cannon Dude he's freaking out about jake Layman Guy barely saw the floor Please keep me updated on subsequent tweets https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1146766931573301248?s=21 What an inspiring message from our president on this great 4th of July morning Nothing more American than a little cocaine on the 4th of July amirite https://www.instagram.com/p/Bzgpin4gIx5/?igshid=1bb7mwr0rgtpt The goat https://twitter.com/darrenrovell/status/1147127081421160448?s=21 Lol good ol fake outrage https://twitter.com/shamscharania/status/1147308645375500294?s=21 Let's get Dwight as the backup to whiteside and have the ultimate clown show at C Dwight would get side tracked with the huge selection of gay bars in Portland https://twitter.com/davidaldridgedc/status/1147309575588200449?s=21 Oh shit let's actually pickup Bradley tho Assuming he gets way more than the minimum but we can dream He'd be perfect off the bench TRUE Even if kawhi leaves, Lakers could give Bradley the room exception (4.8 mil) aka we have no chance The Knicks got their regular season starting lineup out here playing in summer league lol Zion is living up to the hype right now ?That's why we traded them. Huge pussies Hot take. Malika Andrews > Taylor rooks https://twitter.com/chrisbhaynes/status/1147382946745032705?s=21 Wowowowow No odds on Haynes getting it first either I love this. More parity https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1147383639036092416?s=21 What the fuck!!!! Never mind No parity Clippers to the finals Thunder massive step back Clippers step up This is great Literally like 12 teams that could win the title this year Danny green got 15 a year!!!! Da fuck I think Russ is a lifer. He has a fat contract. Can be the man Will go down as best player in Sonics history God gundy is gonna be so thrown when he wakes up to kawhi Clippers Remember when Jalen said 99% raptors Roberson Would be legit Yeah is Russ gonna get traded I'm still so shocked by all this. Everyone said clippers were last place PG also cheated on her and knocked up a stripper Great storyline to follow space good call Brock* So how is the western conference ranked now? I feel like golden state, Clippers, Lakers, Utah, Blazers, rockets, Nuggets are all lumped together And what does Toronto do from here? Do they tear it down? Too bad we couldn't have waited and traded for Gasol instead of Whiteside https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1147572442593992704?s=21 Where's he going? Dehaan, PG was dating her when he played in Indiana, then he cheated on her with a stripper and got her pregnant. Now she's engaged to Seth Curry What do they have to trade tho? Wiggins is the worst contract in the league lol https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1147575087140417536?s=21 https://twitter.com/windhorstespn/status/1147582600409600000?s=21 Lol https://twitter.com/business/status/1147582357958004737?s=21 Did it ever leave? Yeah they're pretty bad Is he ballin out? I don't have ESPNU smh How did Portland's odds get worse lol Kawhi/PG is the best defensive wing tandem the league has seen in decades Lakers are ass tho https://twitter.com/shamscharania/status/1147918919828508672?s=21 Lacob going full '77 blazers Lmaooo Barbosa and Livingston too What in the fuck is that haha B/R Football deleted that tweet already lol Whiteside is gonna play great for us until we trade him for Love in January Dylan. It's gonna be great https://twitter.com/flfawc2018/status/1147942462851309580?s=21 Bigger mood ?? Also he tagged his company 35Ventures. Does he change that to 7Ventures now? Did I say that? That's a great quote ? US women revenue is way higher and they get paid way less. It's pretty simple If the men's team lost every game in the World Cup they'd almost make more than the women winning it all https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/19/us-womens-soccer-games-now-generate-more-revenue-than-mens.html US soccer is also sitting on a $150 million surplus they could dip into Gundy I bet it's even lower Like 42.5 or something They always dog us https://twitter.com/yahoosportsnba/status/1148335892517597188?s=21 Wtf does this even mean Lol Fultz 2.0?

You screen printed a t shirt cool story bro Good lord He started that company from the ground up like Hayden Meriwether bought his house in Portland It's true. Suns are gonna be a force Yeah hard to tell what Russ will fetch I feel like it's gotta be more than just salary relief. Dude is still an all star He's averaged a triple double for 3 straight years lol https://www.instagram.com/p/Bzt7wXYhtTi/?igshid=1qtmkrrfkpgx6 What could've been Livingston would be perfect Over Heat are trash Over Boston Indy and Brooklyn? What Clayton said I'm used to it now. They're never gonna come around Brock is that professor everyone hates Y'all don't watch John wick? Lol what'd they do Oh I thought they got in trouble haha Wow Alright where is CP going? Miami? Didn't that guy try to rape you guys or something https://twitter.com/nbcsnorthwest/status/1150814458446516225?s=21 JR and Hassan sounds like a disaster waiting to happen I'm stoked to see what he can do. But he definitely ain't the smartest dude in the room At his intro presser he said he's excited cuz we made the WCF the last 2 years.

Back in 2014 I graduated from U of O and didn't have shit to do so my parents said "here's 50 grand, go have some fun!" And from there my journey from the bottom started. Kinda surprised we're still keeping Skal around. Could use another guard or wing if we pick up a vet center https://twitter.com/nbadraftwass/status/1151481491320430593?s=21 https://www.instagram.com/p/B0B5MPnhfCs/?igshid=wr1xc13up43d Omg what the fuck is this hahaha I'm so confused It watched like a big brother exit interview or something Like some reality star that was always misunderstood What's with the weird nickelback style music playing in the background lol So many dumb people in the IG comments They were like Seattle isn't in Oregon Both these pics are gonna be used on thousands of twitter bots retweeting "MAGA 2020 ???? !!!" https://twitter.com/jomboy_/status/1151971547147583488?s=21 This is amazing.

Are they trying to look like Ed hardy https://twitter.com/shamscharania/status/1153704092075724801?s=21 Wow how do you feel about this Dubov https://twitter.com/alameeynn/status/1153724518298464256?s=21 Da baby spitting fire Coach gunz! https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1154116983484555264?s=21 Oh baby! I fucks with Pau Plus I'm starting to talk myself into our cap space next year if we don't trade for Love. And getting someone like Draymond Lol mark are you stealing tweets https://twitter.com/viperslol/status/1154117181296168960?s=21 Olshey is getting everyone he tried to sign in 2016. Chandler Parsons is next ? Damn gundy way to kill my high I am kinda worried about wing depth tho. Having Aminu Harkless and ET to throw at elite wings on D was clutch Now we got 6'5 bazemore and string bean Rodney Hood Hopefully Little can have an OG type rookie impact on D Also what about Shaun Livingston to fill the last spot. Take some pressure off Simons Mark is a blog boy Content aggregator Windy hates you mark Most writers who go on tv are pretty good or at least decent. Dave mcmenamin on the other hand is terrible. Idk how he's on the jump Lmaoooo Mark did you make that The PF Chang's is a phenomenal touch. Very few will get that lol Lol I'm fucking dying. What a summer ???????? That summer when Grayson went psycho and ran from the cops, he was on this strange money spending spree. So some of us were living in Eugene and he threw a "party" at his house (which like 12 people showed up to), and Grayson bought a shit ton of PF Changs to go, and Blue Moons for everyone at this party. Weird flex But I ate my weight in crispy honey chicken on graysons dime so I wasn't mad ?Wow 47.5 wins for Portland. Probably the first year we've been properly rated. I'd still hammer the over tho Yeah that seems a bit aggressive space ?I guess Caesar's bumped us down? Or a lot of action on the under?Now I'm pissed https://www.instagram.com/p/B0UI9OUgpK7/?igshid=rj359svapfxt That's some god damn old man strength right there https://www.instagram.com/p/B0XO_THgVO5/?igshid=1u9xoe2mzf8hp How's this make you feel Mark ?Dubov when is Nike doing a restock of the Air Alonzo? Need to cop these for sure https://twitter.com/thescore/status/1119234023316963329?s=21 Wow that's a rough first tat ?Taylor rooks breaks football news too? She definitely fucked someone for that source Quick 15 piece ???? What a tool Matt how are you not blocked? Are you a closet Meyers stan Wow good call. I actually got blocked on the burner too and then forgot the password Really? Lol salem stand up. He's kind of a YouTube guy now Hahahaha I'm fucking dying. That's actually pretty accurate We're at 14 yeah? 2 way doesn't count as a spot ? I bet Olshey leaves it open to start the year tho. For an unbalanced trade or a buy out Livingston could be kinda clutch too Truuuuu What about melo lol https://www.instagram.com/p/B0cvQRJFTvT/?igshid=ey5baoen5flx Odd duo How would he comeback? Free agency or trade? If it's free agency I wonder how much a pay cut he'd take I'd take him back tho why not His contract next season is only partially guaranteed. Spurs could waive him if it's mutual to part ways and we'll have cap space next summer I think Draymond should be target number 1 if he doesn't sign an extension https://twitter.com/highkin/status/1155906541314138114?s=21 Damn Simons is gonna be getting heavy minutes from the jump Haha wow that is next level mark How many shitters do you have and how many employees? Need a ratio Oh boy that's a lot of money Going all in baby Just get draymond or LA next summer and we gucci Modern day Porter/Drexler Oh yeah. I'm with you. I was firm in the trade CJ camp until end of last season + playoffs I'm all in on CJ now. He's a killer Jamal Murray is ass Agreed mark CJ next 5 years: $157 mil
Kemba next 4 years: $141 mil 

I'll take CJ's deal every day of the week Fuck off or get kicked out the chat Ian No warriors love allowed We might! That's why we play the game Most wide open the league has been in a decade God I fucking hate uneducated armchair gm's on Twitter. Such bad takes 

"Portland doesn't have any money for a 3rd player now" It's called an extension which doesn't start for two more seasons. Doesn't change our cap position next summer Clippers are gonna fuck Clippers are legit af dude they're gonna get the 1 seed Beverley, Trez, Harkless, Landry Shamet, Lou Williams is plenty of help ?CJ will be the 20th highest paid player in 2021 when his extension kicks in. And that'll be way lower once more guys sign extensions. I'll take it Also poor wizards lol CJ gotta be close to that top 20 now too He's closer to 20 than 30 100% 9 seed at 45.5 wins im taking the over And maybe Sac They have like 6 centers but still Lol what is this You're right. I'm triggered Okay call me crazy but I think this is the year CJ could make the all star game With Klay out it's basically gonna be a tossup for the last guard spot between CJ, Derozan, Mitchell & Conley, and Murray Yeah cam you've gone Hollywood on us When can we start talking about the finale? I got questions https://www.instagram.com/p/B0mO3WXhKFZ/?igshid=1j8wld4r6wfvk What the fuck ? Anthony Davis is gonna look great next to Zach next summer when he signs with Portland https://twitter.com/omaroneynba/status/1157032868888997888?s=21 Jet setter maroney Should have read:

36B -> 38F -> side chair next to the bathroom -> stand by -> 27C ?Not a UFC fan but this is for mark Clayton pays for league pass Honestly I have cable too And HBO and Showtime and Netflix I've heard great things about it Just met Ty Lue at Catch in Vegas Lol Told him the Lakers fucked up I honestly tried but he was in a mad hurry Wearing a sweatsuit too lol I literally yelled Lakers fucked up as he sipped hahaha Dipped* Omg just met JA Adande too haha Damn We get fucked again Another celeb sighting. Money mayweather just rolled up in the phantom Honked at the valet guy cuz he was moving too slow Prolly couldn't read the sign that said be back in 10 Superliga poll What would you rate Pauly Shore? C list? My friends are acting like he's a celebrity and I said he was on workaholics once Omg Meyers is the softest man to walk this earth Funny thing is Michael would 100% say that to his face ?Jesus Christ this is so dramatic Yeah that story was nauseating. You're a fuckin pro athlete dude suck it up Kyrie's a loose cannon The fact that people still think he's better than Dame blows my mind Dame is having his Drexler moment. Unreal talent but playing in the same era as a transformational star at his same position (Steph) which won't ever get him past 2nd best pg in the league All this talk about top 50 rapper lists has me wondering when Brock is gonna do an updated Sigep sexiest list Not gonna lie, Dylan and D2 being some of the first to become dads (on purpose) is not something I saw coming What y'all think of this guy posting Trump donor information on Twitter? Fair or Foul? Apparently it was public record already so he was just calling attention to it ?Nobody recognizable Right? If you're ashamed your name is out there for donating, that's probably your guilty conscience speaking Lol the qualifier in parenthesis has me dying Lol how about Ted (phony name to indicate Caucasian heritage) Cruz ?I wanna party with Stephanie That's gotta be one of the strangest injuries I've ever heard https://twitter.com/dame_lillard/status/1159126184145256448?s=21 Another Wayne feature and a song titled Ricky Bobby.

That's one funny motherfucker Oh yeah. 4 hours full and he came back out with Jon Stewart after and just took questions from the crowd for 30 min He had the funniest San Francisco story to end the show Happy birthday brotha!

They've been hanging out a lot. CJ better be recruiting Or is it the Cavs that need convincing Neil got me optimistic with all his wheeling this summer. He might be on board I'm game for a Lamarcus reunion. Blake seems like a pipe dream. Gallo could be an option if OKC sucks this year Oh yeah no trading ZC for me. I say we just try getting LA during free agency next year Fair point What cam said Kevin Pelton is when analytics go wrong His models always do that. So dumb. Watch a fucking game nerd Also I heard San Antonio might max derozan. They're not trying to rebuild If we think he could come next summer for free I would hold onto ZC At least LA could throw us a bone and be transparent this time Removed an exclamation from I want to watch LA come crawling back on his own accord, essentially validating he is dumb. Then I will love him again. Removed an exclamation from I want to watch LA come crawling back on his own accord, essentially validating he is dumb. Then I will love him again.

But Houman the difference is there's 3 states on the west coast.

Nurk is an underrated passer He played the plumee pick n roll downhill dish to the corner man better than Plumlee did Batum when he had his one good game Ak47 was dope I can't believe Batum swindled MJ outta 125 mil Guy will take 3 shots in a game I'd do it Philip rivers arm could fall off at any moment Sammy Watkins ballin out Guy who picked Mohomes round 1 in my league isn't looking too crazy atm I dont pick guys I've never heard of.

Who would you have bump him out Dubov? Beal? Mitchell? I can't believe LA is still 16. Would love to see this team with him still at the 4 Yeah I'm really interested to see this Harden/Russ combo. Two highest usage guys in the league and Russ can't shoot. Are they really gonna take Harden off the ball? It's a fair point. I feel like Blake is better than him for sure but apparently he's better than we thought Bring him back next summer for the love of god All will be forgiven when he returns next summer and plays 3rd fiddle to dame and Cj leading us to a championship This cannot be real Only if it was POV I imagine his dick is the same 4 inches as mine.

Literally perfect coverage lol I love how they were talking him up before the game too like "this guys a veteran. He's played a lot of football". Dude he's been in the league 3 years and played 24 games on what planet is he a veteran I swear they just say the same canned shit without any thought. It's like the white guy having high iq and hustle These body weight calls are fucking ridiculous What are you supposed to do? Two hand touch?

Lol But actually. Does she want restaurant recs? Or just stuff to kill time or Stephen A just said Dame shoulda got 1st team over Steph last year Lol regular season award bro I think that's a bit over zealous I'd be surprised if they won 2 ships in the next 4 years Has he been dominant for years? He missed an entire season two years ago He's had two seasons of alpha play averaging 25+ All the others he was a lock down wing averaging 16 https://twitter.com/adamschefter/status/1175141065420083206?s=21 ?Reminder.

Ahead of Kemba, Jimmy, Luka, Gobert, Ben Simmons Dude he's making the all star game for sure! Book it I wanna see CJ and Dame both average 25 Sorry space. It's the blazers time I honestly think this is the easiest year for him to get it. Derozan taking a step back. No Klay. Mitchell hasn't arrived yet. Booker is on a 20 win team. Conley is old Agreed Lol it means we're way better than the heat and my shit talking and homerism is going to another level this year Honestly I think we could see 3 first timers in the west. CJ/Mitchell, Luka, Gobert Glad we're on the same page This whole Ukraine transcript is wild. Are we gonna get a Barr recusal? Will Congress ever see the full complaint? How many free ad impressions is Crowdstike getting today?

If you can grab a 20 point guy then it's a game changer Yeah I feel that ?Oh baby What if six 9ine was the whistle blower ?Me and Zach Lowe are one in the same I honestly don't mind measuring them in shoes. They don't play barefoot. As long as it's consistent across players I know. I'm just saying that's kind dumb Dame is 6'3 on the court But for the record dame is 6'1 and 3/4 without shoes and CJ is 6'2 1/4 according to draft measurements Yeah but all shoes gotta be within a half inch of each other Nobody is wearing platforms lol A basketball shoe is a basketball shoe I wonder how many sub 6' guys this will add to the list That's probably what Sam Jacobs sees when he looks in the mirror ? Lol KOC said Jimmy CP3 Winslow Bam is a finals contender in the east ?? https://syndication.bleacherreport.com/amp/2854727-bleacher-reports-all-time-player-rankings-nbas-top-50-revealed.amp.html Steph at 10 and Kobe at 14 is blasphemous https://twitter.com/mysportsupdate/status/1177329368579944449?s=21 Lol AB got too much CTE Kimball comes in at number 2. Jake Logan number 5 I'd give my left nut to be 6'4 What's wrong with being tall? Lol Besides 6'4 isn't ridiculous. 6'5 and up is getting into that territory Well you can't see over a crowd at a bar, you have a smaller pool of girls to date, you have no future in sports. The list goes on I'm sub 6 foot so I'm with you bro Cam Juarez pulled chicks literally just cuz he was 6'5. He literally didn't say a single word and took home 8s and 9s (And several 4s) It extrapolates passed college Girls like tall guys ???? true 5'9 with a 9 inch hog is like the Donovan Mitchell of poon slayers Hahahaha I'm dying That home depot photo confirms my assertion You don't put bark dust in a bag That's mulch. Two diff things Yeah I think it's absolutely fair. There's nobody in front of him worth bumping back Dame is having his Drexler moment. He's clearly the 2nd best pg in the league now and will be a HOFer. But he just happens to be playing at the same time as an all time great at his position https://twitter.com/shamscharania/status/1177615661406785542?s=21 Omg lol another great pick by the suns Coulda had a Fox/Booker backcourt Hey at least Zach Collins ain't in the G league! So fucking funny He's literally parroting Fox News talking points about conspiracies the whistleblower is a deep state operative and shit haha Big time Hahaha Him and Putin def Effiel towered some hooker Mark meadows and Jim Jordan would go on a tirade that it was some deep fake AI and the video was fabricated Did you see the report that major Dem donors are saying they'd pull support for the party if Warren gets the nomination I'm really underwhelmed with our choice of candidates at the moment Might just join the yang gang Only cuz it rhymes with my favorite activity Was Gary Johnson the one that didn't know what Aleppo was https://youtu.be/pcj8yJk87cs Lmao still makes me laugh. Holy shit "And what is a leppo?" https://www.instagram.com/tv/B27Eow3AfNJ/?igshid=j380mzb9lnl2 Lol this team was so bad. If you take bron off, do they even win 15 games?

He couldn't even get on the floor in the playoffs https://twitter.com/radrivas/status/1178426220880355329?s=21 Lmaooo What happens first: whiteside gets 10 assists or Simmons makes a 3 pointer? https://twitter.com/mcuban/status/1178737567191228416?s=21 Gundy did Neil or terry say anything about starting line ups?

Love that CJ was the legal example for a step back, and Steph was the illegal example Aka the Harden step back Lol yeah I thought that was odd too Harden traveling 7 times a game is gonna be great Haha true. But it is exactly what everyone has been asking for so we'll see I'm sure ESPN will embrace the debate https://twitter.com/nomoremister/status/1178783002962415616?s=21 What a pussy https://www.instagram.com/p/B3Dsuawh9OR/?igshid=1eajm1b9pfkif Our center is better than yours Ian God if Jody brought us a ship How fucking bad are the bengals Remember when people thought Andy dalton was good Is he gonna get minutes this year??

Shaqs was pretty fire actually lol Shaq is the best entertainer the games ever seen. Dame is gonna come back with something hot tho Comparing his money to Trevor Ariza is funny tho when dame will have made half a billion when this contract is up ?Oh my god Bodied him!! Don't mess with dame dolla! Even in Miami won that on the strength of flash ?? Put the dame dolla statue up now ? 105k tweets already lol Lol dame responded so fast some outlets are still posting Shaq's rap saying "will dame respond??" I just realized the first bar said "platinum cuz he bought the copies" I'm dead haha I'm cynical as fuck. So I would say they were probably in on this https://twitter.com/worldwidewob/status/1179059273143373829?s=21 Wob tweeted this 1 minute ago lol keep up https://apple.news/AS_IhDSCiQ_yVSE32HR-W0Q Holy shit was not expecting that.

Bernie $25.3 million
Buttigieg $19 million
Harris $11.6 million 
Yang $10 million
Booker $6 million
Bennett $2.2 million

Warren and Biden yet to report Shoutout to the yang gang tho All his hoop mixtapes are paying off Shocked by how much money he raised Lol this chick on the herd just said Russell Wilson is a first ballot HOFer I guess I just hate when people say that stuff so prematurely. Cuz you're assuming he keeps this up for another 6 years with that statement yeah? If his career ended today he's not a HOFer He's got 26,000 passing yards and one ring You can't tell me that's a HOF resume right now lol I'm not buying that lol if his career ended today he's not going in the hall I just feel like he should be farther down the road in his career to say that. He's basically half way thru. Too many variables to make that claim Stafford has the stats but not the winning percentage or success in the playoffs But you still need stats Not right now is all I'm saying lol. 6 years from now if he keeps this up then of course. I just don't like making the claim that he's a HOFer right now cuz it's not true I needed a get off my lawn hill to die on this morning okay What about Matt Ryan? He's got an MVP Carried by an all time D and elite run game early tho ?? Wow Dubov bringing receipts So is Brees What about Ryan Allen First ballot? Hahahaha I'm dying Randle El used to be the man Ultimate end around pass threat Omg that was amazing haha "Are you talkin to me?!" Haha very true ? I think mayor Pete needs to be the VP on the dem ticket Yeah Kamala sucks. Fuckin narc I think Pete and Booker know they won't win and are gonna start angling for VP bids And he's dating Rosario Dawson which gets him an extra point ?Your next Vice President Also how great is it that Gavin Newsomes ex wife is Donald trump jr's current girlfriend? So many story lines here That had to have been pre-vegan Booker How many times are we gonna hear about 1/1024th if she gets the nod Gasol gonna play 40 mpg ?This is the most "who's on first" slack conversation. I reached out to Andrew with a question then this chick just asks me my own question back? I'm so confused Skal is garbage don't @ me https://twitter.com/cnnbrk/status/1179506500752031745?s=21 Wtf People get more than that for manslaughter Respect to trump for throwing nickelback some pub. Pretty good band if you ask me https://twitter.com/myskinsmylogo/status/1178821943635726337?s=21 This is the greatest thing I've ever watched ?Omg lol this is gonna be great Another Jacob wohl press conference. This one from his driveway alleging Liz was banging some 24 yr old marine lmao https://twitter.com/yahoosports/status/1179754802508644357?s=21 Lol the "thought of being out worked". Ironic cuz that's exactly how I would describe his 7 years in Portland Zach Lowe was talking about that the other day. Like guys bragging about working out at 5am in the summer. You have nothing to do all day, why not wake up at a normal time Unless you're mark wahlberg and go to bed at 7:30pm Wait so trump also told China to investigate Biden? Are we gonna find out he's been using the Tariffs as a bargaining chip for an investigation into Biden? That'd be a doozy https://twitter.com/manda_writes/status/1179827706382487552?s=21 Lol this is incredible How many defamation suits is this kid gonna rack up This is amazing They asked the "marine" to describe his service and he said he was in "unit 13 station in hawaii" ?????? I'm really confused what the marine guys motivation for this is. Did Jacob give him his $200 allowance or something? https://twitter.com/revrrlewis/status/1179768986474549253?s=21 Goff is a HOFer too. If he keeps this up for the next 15 years Eli and Rivers are 100% in Eli beat Brady twice Big Ben is in too Eli Big Ben and Rivers all from the same draft too Brock are you high How is Eli 50/50 Ben is a maybe?! Wtf lol He beat Brady twice! Big Ben is 7th all time in wins. Rivers 9th all time. 

Ben 7th all time td passes. Rivers 6th all time Eli is 8th all time td passes. 12th all time in wins Done Brock Got a few friends here that are from Detroit they love it Omg https://www.instagram.com/p/B3Lsiholcdp/?igshid=pf61896dgb9b Lol so Russ is just copying Brady now? https://www.instagram.com/p/B3LVv5ZlcTq/?igshid=cwg5v6twzip3 Finally some forest green ?Cougar Liz coming in hot I wonder what Beto and Castro raised In 10 years I'm gonna need to see a Jacob Wohl/Charlie Kirk ticket just for comedic purposes https://twitter.com/pace2k00/status/1180159970437976064?s=21 Another winning move from Robert Sarver! The suns GM should just ask Sarver what he would do regarding every move. Then do the exact opposite Ineptitude at its finest Ian did I use that word right? The Pacers should be pretty legit. Picked up Brogdan, McConnell, Lamb and Warren and just lost Bogdonavich and Tyreke right? And get Oladipo back Maybe if he stopped spending so much time rapping and got in the gym he'd be in better shape!! https://twitter.com/dame_lillard/status/1180226637679349760?s=21 !!!! "Only dame you beat was 2000 and that was stoudamire" ?????? Lol how does he have us as a borderline playoff team? Back to back 3 seeds and a trip to the WCF The Jazz haven't done shit yet. Nuggets should be ahead of them too Pretty shitty article from Lowe tbh I don't understand his "will Klay ever return to form" take. The guy scores 60 without dribbling. He can literally stand there and shoot and be the same player ?Today at the White House Those pure money 4's are fire too ? Guys if the jazz made it to the finals with Donovan Mitchell as their best player, you're gonna have to keep me away from sharp objects https://www.instagram.com/p/B3NlWOMgBYN/?igshid=jc0jtjefvkay Blazers were literally the last team posted by the nba account. The disrespect You're the Meyers Leonard of basketball fans hoomie Utah fans all hyped up on Red Bull. They needa chill But yeah the lakers are big af. We're gonna have string bean Rodney hood guarding lebron lmao I'm just saying in the starting line up. But Mario would be dope to throw at him We're just gonna have to win games 121-118 Is Hood for sure starting at the 3? That's what I thought at first. But then everyone on blazers edge kept saying hood Hood does better when he can take undersized twos onto the block. If he plays the 3 full time we lose that advantage He abused Harris and Murray Damn. Needed to house that https://www.instagram.com/p/B3QgpgaBWoR/?igshid=3r5wg17sj0ra About fucking time Herbert will still have a better career than Luck Holy shit. That's chinas team! Did Morey just single handedly plummet the rockets value Fertitta gotta be heated He already denounced the tweet right afterward Jesus mariota getting no help. Kicker is 0/3 Philly D waiver wire pickup was clutch this week 35 points https://twitter.com/yiqinfu/status/1181024883272114180?s=21 This ain't going away any time soon It's a $$$ play. NBA doesn't wanna jeopardize millions of dollars from Chinese fans and sponsorships Guarantee none of the woke nba players will say anything either. Don't wanna hurt their shoe deals But lebron will wear "equality" shoes It's just ironic that the nba will take social stands when it's convenient. Like I get it's a business, and profits matter most. But they decided to come out against the North Carolina bathroom ban and change the all star game because of it Yeah they don't care at all lol censorship at its finest Also ironic how the NBA has had Kanter's back with Turkey censoring him. Because turkey isn't a strategic partner of the NBA I can't wait for Trump to weigh in on this. Ted Cruz already chastised the NBA for not standing up to China, but Trump supposedly promised President Xi that he'd stay silent on the HK protests, and Cruz didn't come at Trump to speak up. Lol funny how everyone gets bold when it doesn't affect their pocket book ?God mario has me rock hard right now God Dubov that sounds like torture With his beanie halfway on his head and air pods in https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1181232249821388801?s=21 Great and Unmatched wisdom. My new email sign off Fuckin nerd Most of those win total projections are so stupid. Just watch a game and spare me the advanced metrics Oh shit I'm in SF. Should I scalp some tix Lol SF all day Just don't say frisco or San Fran I saw that. One of the most racist things I've seen in awhile Guy makes Laura Ingram look tolerant Lol wait Trump is meeting with Erdogan at the White House? The guy really loves dictators Gundy what's your thoughts on Steve Kerr saying no comment to the China news Ian that's exactly what he said But seems like a cop out from the woke king Gundy gets mysteriously removed from the liga Hassan whiteside blazer debut V worth it Him and Bol Bol give the Nuggets some sneaky upside https://twitter.com/chrisadempsey/status/1181757128102432768?s=21 Hood it is Donovan Mitchell starting at the 4 https://www.instagram.com/p/B3YX67qDo7x/?igshid=1ec3imghufuzo 2 pussies in the same pic Terry been hittin ripper magoos since '72 They're insufferable Love the rivalry we got going Just watched highlights from last night cuz I missed the game. ZC's midrange jumper is looking sweet Simons looks like the real deal Bazemore and Mario are gonna be fan favs for sure Ian how did Meyers do? Bazemore had 7 steals in 20 minutes lol Basically the exact opposite of Harkless in terms of motor and effort ?Summer to Winter in one day ?80 yesterday. 20 today Holy shit haha that is insane Morey just lit the league on fire He wanted more of a money ball challenge so he sabotaged the cap. Big dick move I just drove an hour in the snow for a sales meeting and after 5 minutes the CIO said "were done here gentlemen. You can leave". How's your guys Thursday going? Haha no not at all Cam you gonna try copping the Travis Scott 6's tomorrow? https://twitter.com/hctrudo/status/1182359492312350720?s=21 Warren/Gillum?! That's what happens when we let nerds talk sports gundy Where's the context. Gimme the eye test. Maybe watch the game O/U 55.5 in Oregon Everyone still hammers the over Apparently Quick wrote an article on championship aspirations this year and everyone on blazers edge had a huge boner Hey Ian, I think this is Portland's year We're winning it all. Tell me I'm crazy How are they gonna do personalized lines? Just base it on geo? They gonna mine my tweets and see I slurp dame You gotta get that spam filter so you don't accidentally answer a call from Somalia gundy ? ?Let's goooooo First SNKRS pickup. Bout to flip these on StockX ?That's quite the ratio God I love blazers fans. Fan post on blazersedge "Could Skal play the 3 and be our solution to defending PG and Kawhi?" Then the sarcastic responses "why stop at 3 7 footers? Let's put Pau at the 2 and Nurk at the 1!" ?Just came my pants Eh I Was gonna buy a new Tv this week so these shoes will pay for it in full Not a big fan of the 6's tbh Only J's I really rock these days are 11's and 1's. Maybe some 3's if I get my hands on a pair 7th grade chad would be all over these tho. With my XXL tall tee Oooh now you're talking You already know Truuuuu points I'll never drop my baggy in the stall again! And Rupert Murdoch met with Barr yesterday. Coincidence? Funny their definition of worst. Most speeding tickets would equal best IMO ?Spaceman's hometown is #1 ?Brock you're a physics major how do I get this mirror to hang flush to the wall? Do I need a longer nail? Yeah I tried that and the weight up top is too much ?Ian I basically did that trying to hang this clock. There's about 17 holes behind that thing I was like fuck this wall I own you Lmao I could see the similarity Did you guys see the KAT equinox tweet? ?Lmaoooo The last line is ironic cuz their daddy Trump definitely does blow https://twitter.com/jrehling/status/1180505950613958658?s=21 If you haven't read about Sudafed gate it's worth it Hahahahaha Clay Travis FTW Removed a laugh from Guys I gotta be honest, Matt Cox came up with he caption last night. We were dicked and I was the photographer but he came up with the caption. I cant lie to you guys its been making me feel sick. Fire freddie Worst play caller in the nfl Best game of winless teams I've seen in a minute Lmao He's been so bad Titans have also failed him. 5 offensive coordinators and a LB with a credit card thin playbook as head coach He needs to move on this summer https://www.instagram.com/p/B3ke-ZSArzm/?igshid=18hsjuojzazwh Why is this getting so much play lol 90% of the group chat could do that Damn this forth worth police shooting is wild That cop is going to jail too and hopefully longer than 10 years The police chief right now is coming pretty hard at the officer. Just said he would have fired him for multiple infractions if he didn't resign first https://twitter.com/nicholemanna/status/1183809826972950528?s=21 Oh boy https://twitter.com/profgalloway/status/1183207739675291654?s=21 Where's the ad guys at.

What a sellout Blood money bron https://twitter.com/samesfandiari/status/1181236522860724225?s=21 Lol so lebron reiterated this isn't about the substance (communism) it's about the ramifications (hurt his business) I just lost by .1 points cuz Aaron Rodgers kneeled twice and i got negative points ? ? Lol this is like the Trump there's a tweet for everything game https://twitter.com/chrisbhaynes/status/1184152554428485632?s=21 If Russell wins MVP this year is he a HOFer? Gonna be a good debate Rachel Nichols argument for long 2's was cringe worthy tho She just jerks off players like no other in everything she says Oh I agree. But that's not what the debate is centered on Also it's more nuanced. Is there 20 seconds on the shot clock? Are you one foot inside the line I did hear from a reputable journalistic source that d Wade bent her over My high school coach was ahead of the times. We had a "layups or 3's only" rule back in '09 Yeah that's a fair argument Dubov Yeah I'll take CJ midrange jumpers over layups all day Yeah he had one of the highest paint fg% in the league for years lol Mark comes in hot with the I love lamp moment https://www.instagram.com/p/B3qRgPZgxBS/?igshid=16mfwfs8ll2sz Mariota era over? He's a FA this summer tho. Bet they move on after this season regardless Who's gonna need a QB this summer? Gimme him or Scam Newton in Denver Haha what's your theory I'll co-sign it with you If only we could get Denver native CMC with him If Kyle Allen goes 6-0 you don't think they ride it out? Trade cam for young assets 0-8 in his last 8 starts Matt Ryan won an mvp too Not advocating it but just saying I wouldn't be surprised True true She's hanging her hat on the wording. She keeps referring to costs rather than taxes. It's an annoying political charade but it makes sense given that 90% of people are just going to hear her say taxes are going up and not listen to the rest The pool is looking pretty sad IMO Lol yeah the only thing worse would be a Ford Flex Y'all are haters Yang is a man of the people Gabbard can take her Assad apologist rhetoric and gtfo You see the squad is officially endorsing Bernie Mark is that that animal kingdom remake? I'm confused by Kamala trying to hang her hat on the "boot trump off Twitter" take ?Sir this is a Wendy's Haha that's such a 50+ move Wtf space ?I'll take this ?Cardale from the top rope Yeah We ain't the ones that need Melo anymore. He needs us. Shoulda came the first time Mario is better anyways https://www.instagram.com/p/B3sKTyNn7L0/?igshid=n3o6a5xkegtz Relevant to yesterday's convo https://twitter.com/chrisbhaynes/status/1184531062141136896?s=21 Siakam is getting maxed
Buddy got offered 4/90 but wants 4/110
Jaylen Brown got offered 4/80 but wants a max Let's clear the deck next summer and offer Brown 4/100 Amin picked Portland as his sleeper team to win the title. I just pitched a tent in my shorts ?This is my office. I wear shorts 24/7 it's great And yeah it's also 80 something degrees right now I hear NY is gonna get hit with a bomb cyclone soon?? ?This is amazing Lol oh yeah I thought that was implied The standard has dropped so low Jesus Happy 4th bday to the liga ? https://twitter.com/matthewberrytmr/status/1184544364296658945?s=21 This is so good. Fantasy football in a nutshell Holy shit really He wants 4/110 Shared that yesterday but fuck me right Sometimes I feel like I'm writing in invisible ink guys!! Lol in his defense he did average 21/5/2 on 43% from 3 And that was high volume. 8 attempts a game. Same as Dame Also, this is classic Sacramento ineptitude. They start making some good moves, get a good young core, then they give Harrison Barnes $85 million this summer. And might lose buddy over it Lol I'm just fucking with you. But yeah that is a bold stance to take. I feel like they could meet in the middle at 4/100 and everyone would be happy Also do we know the full China fall out? Could the cap shrink next year like some were saying? He might wanna take his money Get a player option on year 4 https://twitter.com/ndrew_lawrence/status/1184647737050062848?s=21 This is incredible. Does he not realize the irony? Lol Mulvaney also just admitted in testimony that there was a quid pro quo lol I can already see the new rnc talking point. "Okay it was a quid pro quo about investigating the DNC Servers from 2016! It was never about Biden" Jesus Christ. The G7 in June is confirmed at Trump Doral Resort. Which is in Miami. During hurricane season And climate change won't be on the agenda lol of course Mulvaney was adamant Trump isn't profiting off the event. How can you possibly say that with a straight face? Lol of course he's profiting he still owns it https://twitter.com/bobbymarks42/status/1184806072898478086?s=21 Beal's extension was a smart move on his part. Can opt out after his 10th year and get max dollars on a 4/5 year deal Also good for Washington cuz his trade value is gonna be higher now That Wall deal is atrocious tho ?Nba GM survey came out today. Angry Westbrook and kyrie stans everywhere You think he'll top his unanimous mvp year? More specifically you think he'll average over 30? I like the Embiid bet actually If he can play 70 games and they get the 1 seed 20 bucks says he beats it Deal For sure I agree with Rengel too. League wants more mvp's Jokic, Embiid, AD etc would all be sick Donovan michell? Oh dame You don't think if the nuggets get the 1 seed he has a chance? Fair point. He's not sexy enough to win in my books On the court and off Just too ugly I don't think Harden wins again Dude that's a lock! Okay I take it back Lol. You have to average 20 a game to win Other than Siakam who was a beast across the board, last player to win MIP and not average 20 points a game was Paul George in 2012 God if he does that I'll break my tv Makes zero sense Take dame out with 3 minutes left in the 3rd. Put him back in if you have the ball with the shot clock off and can score to end the quarter. Then leave him on the bench til 10 min left in the 4th ZC starting Dame CJ Hood ZC Whiteside Bazemore is gonna be a breath of fresh air from ET He's looked so nice And can actually shoot the 3 7'0 wingspan for Baze. Compared to ET's trex arms = much better defense too You know I love a long wingspan Wait blazers play in Denver tonight?? Damn yeah dame and CJ def ain't playing then huh Tickets are 3 bucks. Keep me posted I can confirm the Menver thing https://twitter.com/anthonyvslater/status/1184706046499024897?s=21 I fully support all Robert Sarver slander If Alabama and Clemson are locks then it'd be between Ohio State/Penn State, Oklahoma and us for the final two Gotta hope LSU loses to Auburn and Bama ?This is a helluva ad. I'm trying to add nba league pass and they show me Dame scoring over Mitchell https://twitter.com/thehill/status/1184923536458178561?s=21 ? Quite the 180 Lol you had the 4th pick of course you got someone good There was a huge drop off after the top 5 Rengel I knew you'd break the news in blazers fashion. Congrats man! Michael "Aubrey Graham" Rengel Damn Mahomes dislocated knee? I was shocked Denver got best home court advantage on the GM survey but I guess they put a lot of stock in the altitude Hezonja with 18/6/5 off the bench right now ?Ledlow said it herself Spaceman with the hottest takes Unmask the Milwaukee slanderer! Who was it?! Mark? https://youtu.be/p46BGkWa_oI Watch these 2 minutes and tell me the blazers aren't winning it all this year He's got that midrange jumper down He pretty much plays exactly how we hoped Meyers would have played But watching Meyers slide laterally for 5 seconds and you could see he doesn't have a fast twitch muscle in his body Lmao You're gonna fucking hate him in about 2 weeks He just posted an insta with a navy seal line as the caption. Dude you weren't in the military https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1185218470096592896?s=21 I like Candy corn. Def in moderation tho Pure sugar Jesus I'm listening to the Simmons russillo over/under pod. You can tell they haven't paid a second of attention to Portland. Simmons said 46 is way too high lmao Also "who starts at the 4? There's no way in hell Collins starts there". Everything they said after that was invalidated He's so dumb https://www.instagram.com/p/B3wtlk3jCbl/?igshid=1botqpl7dms1u Drop Bayless Drip * Mark remember when you were talking shit about sailgating ?Btw already flipped my Travis Scott's and looks like I did it just in time cuz price came down a ton Were they fly? I didn't even get to open them Lol I sent it in the group chat I think I even said hey cam check it out I think I have been shadow banned. Wait til Brock's analytics come out in January I'll have the most texts sent with zero response Hezonja hezonja hezonja ?Preach Zach! Wonder what it would take to get Griffin. Could we keep Zach and Simons? Lol Ian have fun with Meyers this year Hahaha dude Griffin will get traded His contract is too big and Detroit sucks Salary cap relief and several firsts gets you in the conversation Lol dude that's not true at all. People who watch basketball know Zach Collins ceiling Shit even Russillo said he has Kevin Mchale esque footwork What are you talking about? He was key in beating the nuggets He put both out starting forwards on the bench What series did you watch Your comment that he was irrelevant in the playoffs tells me everything I need to know about your Zach Collins knowledge You tell me Name your number "He became completely irrelevant in the playoffs" 10 points / 7.5 rebounds? Deal I'll bet you $100 on the over Fair Sounds good I'm buying a Collins jersey now. I'm all in I love it. Between this and Embiid over 64 games I'm gonna have some good subplots to follow But on the Blake point. He's one of those guys that has to go to a certain scenario. Only teams that have true championship aspirations are gonna trade for him. That limits it to 12 or so teams. Then factor in his contract and injury history I'm just saying it's not as simple as oh he averaged 25/8/5 every team would want him Obviously I'm a blazers homer lol but that was my point Salary relief plus 3 first rounders would be a good starting point Also I thought Zach sucked so why is he so key to a trade all the sudden lol Also I thought I was just texting you a for a second space and forgot there's 10 other people here lol I agree he's certainly not known by the casual fan or shitty GM I watched a 2 minute pre season highlight last night and got hard as fuck okay Aminu averaged 9/7 last year tho and he'll easily take those numbers I'm most worried about the rebounds Oh I wasn't looking at stats. It's called the ol eye test lol Dude he's the starting 4 you know this right ?Look at him stay close to Gobert to fend off the ally oop. Then block the initial shot. Then recover and block Gilbert's follow up That's elite! ?This is our new starting line up https://twitter.com/anthonyvslater/status/1185236433470017537?s=21 Somewhere Neil Olshey is punching the air at that average age of the warriors https://twitter.com/tulsigabbard/status/1185289626409406464?s=21 Dubov's girl Lmao I got so hyped on that gundy Look at that 2 block sequence against the Jazz tho. Filthy footwork Good thing he's taller than 90% of the league! Really??? ?I always thought this photo proved the 7' theory ??Clickbait vs. real journalism Haha I never said he wasn't MVP! I said he wasn't a HOFer already If you wanna crown his ass, crown his ass! That's a good question. I don't think he has Not gonna say sorry. But I'll say I love really think pancakes Lol so was I https://www.instagram.com/p/B3zquoXg1oU/?igshid=1h62uqs85rxgz Oh my goodness https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1185619666150068224?s=21 extension deadline is Monday. Do jaylen brown and buddy get contracts too? I'm guessing Celtics wait on Jaylen / maybe trade him for Sabonis. I bet Buddy and Sac meet in the middle at 4/100 Love Dicks That's epic Haha that would be amazing He just snags like 19 boards in the season finale to push me over the top Holy shit. Wisconsin falls Let's fucking go Aka we could trade him for Blake straight up God terrible Defense Lenior needed to keep outside leverage with no WR split out. Idk why we he shifted so far over Fuck yes That was huge Fuck fuck fuck Wow we got away with one there haha I thought you were at the game haha Omg I would be furious haha Herbert leads us to another win like the nfl HOFer he is What Rengel said Always fade harbaugh ?Chapter 1: my dad gave me a bunch of money and we opened the next day. 

The end That would be quite the collab. All we'd need is Meyers to make the ultimate trio https://twitter.com/adamschefter/status/1185957916915970054?s=21 It makes me laugh every time Jon Gruden says he needs pass rush help That's true that was a good pick And he's cheap This is the Aaron Rodgers game I've been waiting for Just needed a matchup with that great raiders team dylan What a day to have Marvin Jones on your fantasy team. 4 tugs Wow Peters Who the fuck is chase Edmonds. I've never even heard of that dude ESPN still working on their gambling coverage. 

Molly: take it or leave it: do the Jets cover the spread tonight against the pats?

Stephen A: what's the spread? 

Molly: 10 

Stephen A: leave it! I think the Jets lose by less than that tonight! https://twitter.com/carmichaeldave/status/1186307318952017924?s=21 I'm guessing 4/$100M https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1186316753292447746?s=21 I feel like there should be more incentive based contracts like this. He makes all star games, he gets closer to the $106 number, and team is probably doing well so it's a win win. He doesn't play that well, he still secured a lot of money Inject this into my veins gundy. 50 year anniversary! It's destiny Don't hate space. You gotta get on board one day Yeah I agree on the Clippers take. They're too good I'm feeling a WCF return tho I think Gundy's right about a low seed. They're gonna load manage. But regular season doesn't matter Assuming they're healthy in the playoffs they're the best team. Regardless if they're the 7 seed Denver or Houston getting the 1 seed IMO Clips seem a little more top heavy tho yeah? They aren't gonna go 17-5 when Kawhi rests like Toronto did PG out at least 10 games to start Also wouldn't be surprised if they rested Kawhi and PG at the same time some games I meant later in the year on both them resting. Even when PG is healthy they'll load manage him too. It's the nature of the game these days You know who doesn't load manage? Harden and Russ. They'll be a top 2 seed and lose in the conference semis ?@space Lol ain't nobody saying that about the heat that's for sure That's the 10th question they asked in the segment Brock Never said it was Just love every chance to talk shit lol https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1186362922932625408?s=21 Don't we got an open roster spot ?? https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1186368729061441536?s=21 Wow That's a lot of dough Only other option is waiting til summer and matching whatever he gets He was restricted Still wonder if they trade him for Sabonis. Seems like a win for both teams I'm a mini Mchale believer. Gimme Zach Zach is gonna get MIP talk this year. I'm all the way on board My only question is whos gonna be an all star first. Ant or Zach? https://twitter.com/shamscharania/status/1186373077539737601?s=21 Now that is a bargain Big dick negotiating by Pritchard https://twitter.com/shamscharania/status/1186373810729246720?s=21 It gets better! Wowowow https://twitter.com/shamscharania/status/1186382598085533696?s=21 At least they're doing the safer surgery and not ripping his meniscus out like bRoy Guys Maroney called this months ago. Zion could be the best player from that draft but he also might not Gotta give him credit Haven't seen anything major lately. He was pretty tore up by the joe Johnson news. You'd think his Big 3 experience would have landed him a full time roster spot Never mind my earlier comment. Sounds like they removed the portion of meniscus rather than repair it. Hopefully it was a very small piece they removed otherwise he fucked long term ?I just realized we have the highest payroll in the league this year Lol Jody high roller https://twitter.com/muthafuckingjay/status/1185796330406502401?s=21 The accuracy Agreed I can't believe the nba season starts tomorrow. And Blazers Wednesday. My blazer boner is fully torqued Crazy that this is year 8 for Dame I was in Seattle watching it with Dylan. Good times Houman you're the guy that says you only have to watch the 4th quarter of games Us real fans are strapping in Houman you don't get to come to the championship parade when we win it all. Only fans that were there the whole season Brock what's the steaming sitch for nba games this year Does reddit work anymore What's a discord Chad not good at technology Is there an app for that I'll give it a look lol Alright going on record with a few predictions 
- CJ makes his first all star team 
- Zach averages over 10.5 pts & 7.5 boards (bet with space)
- Embiid plays over 64.5 games (bet with Dubov)
- Portland finishes with 50+ wins 
- Portland makes it to the WCF
- Giannis wins MVP
- Chris Paul gets traded to the heat Agreed West seeding is gonna be nuts. 3-7 could all be within a game of each other Gundy that Jordan quote makes me so happy lol I wish we got more interviews from him. Greatest player ever and he barely speaks That's gonna be epic Whatever happened to the jail blazers doc? Weak This astros locker room drama has taken an interesting turn https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/wes-wilcox-on-play-off-predictions-portland-la-and-lebron/id1225356682?i=1000454272373 Good piece on the blazer Wilcox called Zach one of the best defensive bigs in the league I fully support this name change mark https://twitter.com/adamschefter/status/1186599521796677632?s=21 Seems like a lot for Sanu I got AJ green lurking on 2 of my teams if he ever comes back ?Found Ian's burner I mean they probably shouldn't have an entire team that's white Gotta be intentional about diversity cmon man If they apply is a sorry excuse It's falls on the hiring team itself and the organization as a whole. But it starts from the top down. Companies need to proactively work to create an inclusive environment, and then seek out those candidates who may be qualified but aren't aware of the job/finding the company. Get out to universities across the country, speak in under served areas to promote the work you do etc. Sitting back and saying we don't have any diverse applicants isn't an acceptable stance If that's the case, then teams/orgs need to think about "okay what are we doing that's not attracting a diverse applicant pool?" Not saying that all falls on one hiring manager Dubov. But it's a concerted effort as a whole that needs to happen Yeah Idk Dubov these are all great questions and I by no means think I have the answers haha. I'm just saying that recruiting a diverse workforce HAS to be an intentional thing. Whether that's successful or not depends on tons of other variables. But being aware of it, and making an effort to recruit those of color is a good start But gundy makes an excellent point about any representation matters. The one black guy who could have spoke up and said something and brought a different perspective to the video creation and perception, isn't there anymore. So you're left with a bunch of white people who don't have that difference in viewpoint or life experience to say something One other thing on the point about POC not wanting to move to Portland Dubov. It's kind of a chicken or the egg thing but that's why it's important to have a diverse/inclusive group to begin with in helping recruit others with diverse backgrounds because someone of color from the south probably isn't gonna want to move to Portland to work with a bunch of white people in a place so unfamiliar. Does your company have employee resource groups? Black excellence, latinx, etc where they can find a community within the org. Does your company actively talk about diversity and representation? Those are all things that can proactively be done to help in the recruiting and attracting a diverse applicant pool Lol I'm not talking about sitting in a meeting saying "alright guys we needa be more diverse". I agree That happens all the time without any results https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2019/09/representation-matters.html "Talking" as in things like this. Doesn't necessarily have to be a huge event like this but salesforce is a great example Yeah and that totally makes sense. There's only so much they can do. But as long as the effort is there, that's a great start But if you just sit on your hands and say "well nobody applies" then you're not doing your part ?NBA scout on the blazers Haha no I woulda hyped us way more Lol screenshot from the website didn't fit in one page Something I was thinking about yesterday, is it possible dame and CJ could both average 25+? I feel like CJ should get more shots than last year. Especially with Nurk out Will smith lost his magic touch Or just takes shitty scripts US China Trinidad https://twitter.com/adamschefter/status/1186716765084094469?s=21 Mark how stoked are you Who's taking his place I was hoping you weren't gonna say president xi Who's Donahoe Oooh tech guy huh Alvin Gentry going with the ol 12 man rotation game 1. Bold move Lol Powell 30 footer is not what I woulda drawn up I feel like that's a scenario where Nurse should've just let it fly after the rebound. Why set it up for a trash shot like that. Especially with Siakam our Out Who is this Moe Harkless I'm honestly not just tryna be contrarian but I kinda like Reggie Yeah shamet was a nice get in that Tobias trade I think it definitely does. First 2 rounds will be a cake walk West winner could have to play 3 7 game series Yeah we can't afford it. Houston won't either Doubt Denver does TRUE Danny flame thrower Carrying bron on his back Lol that's such a terrible take from buddy. You can say that about every team in the league Guys, accept true fate and join gundy myself and our goddess t rooks on the right side of fate Fuck yes So that's what Cam has been building this whole time ?Hold up. Moving to Texas Not crazy at all. I completely agree Everyone on twitter saying that didn't watch more than 2 blazer games last year I think Hezonja will definitely play a lot of 4 on paper. But handle the ball while out there Tolliver will prob get like 10 minutes of run a game too I'd be surprised if Nurk is back by March Does anybody here use YouTube tv Dubov how much is it? I hear it's $50 flat no fees? Such bullshit btw, rumor is Salt Lake City won the 2023 NBA all star bid over Portland Yeah I'm thinking about going to YouTube tv and the just adding HBO Yeah that's ridiculous. Does China own Comcast? You can add league pass on YTTV I think too Mark that's all I needed What do you do for internet then? Comcast still? Century link? ?Brad and Chad just tryna sell some software Hahah I forgot about that lady. Just repeating my question back to me https://twitter.com/kyleclark/status/1187113457939820544?s=21 Wait holy shit. Trump is building a wall in Colorado?! Portland will never get any love https://twitter.com/lindacohn/status/1187082760965328897 https://twitter.com/yahoosportsnba/status/1187124857391276038?s=21 Lol Ian the Heat are off to a great start Especially if it's a side piece Might be a hidden child like drake Mark jones needs to stop saying Kanter got traded to Portland Wait Meyers is starting for the Heat hahahahaha That's incredible Also pretty funny that our starting 4 last year comes off the bench for the Magic this year https://www.instagram.com/p/B3-5LulF33a/?igshid=4b518co3zhyn Meyers gets posterized ?? This game fucking blows. Cut to the blazers Fuck I don't have ESPNNEWS This is horseshit! This game also started 15 minutes late. I don't get why they do that I can't believe this is happening I waited 5 months for this and I'm gonna miss the tip Meyers finishes with 0 points and 4 fouls in the start tonight Gonna be a fun season space! Okay Dubov you said you hate Reggie, hubie brown is 10 times worse Omg stop fouling This is brutal. Just end the game Omg the shot clock violation at the end Lol 3! Let's go! Hood and Collins give me so much life. Light years better than Harkless and Aminu brick laying and sulking around God CJ is so filthy All star CJ Whiteside just needed a new lease on life. Had to get away from that dumpster fire of an org they call the Miami Heat Just give whiteside and nurk 24 minutes each Tolliver first off the bench?!! Annnnd a turnover Cmon old man Now Skal Oh boy Tolliver's role will be replaced with a Hood/Kanter mid season addition Mark my words Eat a fucking salad Mario time Omg!!! I just came!! I'm limp again Fuck off mark Space has been awfully quiet tonight!! Hahahaha omg Mark I'm crying That's Meyers for sure Shares the password with his wife Dammit Simons Just pau Time for Zach Collins to eat Jokic has been on the bench all game and we're losing. Not good Yeah I don't like the 5 scrubs at once Is that Hakeem or Zach Collins?? I love Zach Pau's biggest contribution this year is gonna be teaching Ant his way around a wine menu Simons needs to be in dunk contest God they are on fire He looks like a sommelier God what are we doing ?We should add Donovan to the group chat I can't wait for the stat. Hassan whiteside first blazer with 22 points, 18 rebounds, 3 blocks and 4 sips of Gatorade in a home opener since 1984 Dame is so streaky Trash call by the opposite ref on that charge https://twitter.com/worldwidewob/status/1187215482883063808?s=12 Favorite tweet of the night Conley went 1-16 in his Jazz debut. Woof Hezonja better tbh I totally forgot Baynes, Kaminsky and Saric are on the suns this year. What a weird roster Welp Whoa Zach Need a bucket here Do or die There we go Fucking Dave with the jinx And that's all she wrote Oh look who it is Space I was thinking the opposite. My Collins bet looks great He's only gonna get better Collins did look great Nunn is just on a shitty team. Empty stats Simons also played against the best bench in the nba How's that starting center position for ya https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1187222295556874241?s=21 This is gaslighting Yes I agree with Matt. Uncalled for Yeah I like how quiet you were the whole fucking game Then you slither out from under your rock Yeah space you ruin our echo chamber I want irrational exuberance only For how much they pay people on ESPN it's pretty sad how little they actually know. Stephen A just ranted for 5 minutes that the sixers are idiots and shoulda buckled up and paid the luxury tax to keep Redick on this team They had to renounce his rights to sign Horford. So it was an either or. They never could have had both. Dumbass ?Jeff Garlin is all of us this morning Love those Good pickup https://twitter.com/ShamsCharania/status/1187472634704879617 ?Hassan shoulda hung a left to the sauce God Chris Webber is really hard to listen to https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1187532783985541120 He taking roids? A little coke out in Scottsdale? ?Beautiful Lol hopefully they're not a Portland sponsor That'd be worse than when the digital team kept giving Meyers the red bull dunk of the game. Red Bull was probably pissed WSU is just a bunch of corn fields and parties. I've met 2 people from there and both dropped out ASU also has like 80,000 students. They let anyone in Yeah The 3.0 auto accept was so ridiculous lol Yeah when I saw you didn't have to write an essay I was like "boom. Done. Applying to college is easy!" Isn't Oregon like 50%+ out of state now? I started writing an essay for UCLA and then gave up after 5 minutes and applied to Oregon Haha holy shit I forgot about that space I applied because of our elite sports business program okay. It got me a great sales job selling software Honestly after I saw the out of state tuition costs, it narrowed it down to Oregon and Oregon state immediately. And then j chose Oregon cuz I didn't wanna be a loser the rest of my life It was a pretty easy decision Dubov my new favorite description of a bar is "not usually a strip club" Jeter is trying to sell the Players Tribune. I wonder how much of that he actually owns https://twitter.com/nate_mann13/status/1187773053410799616?s=21 Lmaooo must win! If we go 0-2 we're fucked! The warriors are very bad gundy I watched most of that game Steph was fine but they're playing with guys named Poole, Paschall, Robinson III, Spellman Leandro barbosa ain't walking thru that door Shaun Livingston ain't walking thru that door Charles made a good point too. Steph will score 30, Russell will score 20, draymond will score 15. Where's the other 45 points coming from I would love that gundy but we don't have the contracts Yeah if we wanted to trade Baze that's the only way it works That's a small upgrade tho. I'd rather keep Baze and his bird rights Try signing him cheaper next summer Fair I like Baze a lot tho. Iggy has like 30 games of basketball left Lmaoooo Where's the receipts Maroney! He's the Jacob Wohl of nba Twitter "I was telling people at a hipster coffee shop in LA that Zubac was the best pickup at the deadline" ?He sure never tweeted that take Space quit concern trolling maroney https://www.sfchronicle.com/warriors/article/Yes-even-the-Warriors-get-San-Francisco-sticker-14560779.php This article is nuts Glenn Robinson is renting a 2 bedroom next to the salesforce tower for $7,900 a month. And he had to write the landlord a short bio and provide rental recommendations to secure the place ?? Shams said baby then deleted the tweet I'm sensing some drama Like Jimmys GF had a baby but dna tests show Waiters is the father Maroney said he's thoroughly impressed with the album. I trust his musical critiques Cam do you only send gif's now instead of email attachments? ?Can you try slipping this one into an email next time? I could produce so many nuts in 15 years Spurs guaranteed LA's deal next year. He won't be a FA and come to Portland now He could ask for a trade I'd offer Little and Tolliver (@spaceman) But idk Cam I'd say yes for sure Who knows what the spurs are doing. They have several young guys and then LA and Demar https://apple.news/A6OPJVkavT_Oac-A9M8_nCA I wonder what the sales rep on that deal made Wtf Haha Simons getting loose Why are there so many open seats in sac I feel like I'm watching a d league game Did President Xi buy all the tickets so there'd be empty seats and the NBA would look dumb? You never know! Also I'm watching this on league pass and they volume is all fucked up. The announcers are loud as shit and you can't hear anything game related Pascal max baby All star starter? Dwayne Dedmon looks like a guy you play pickup with at LA fitness Towns had 37/15/8 in 28 minutes. No wonder yahoo had him ranked as the #1 fantasy player Well fuck He had 36/14 last game He's gonna average 28 and 12 Is Booker terrible tho? That's Dubov's boy Wow OT Sarver redemption? Tolliver shoots every time he gets the ball Does he know there's 2 other things he can do? Hahaha holy shit that's gold Second clip was channeling my inner Liz Warren. I'm 1/32 Native American Idk i think I'd rather have Kendrick Nunn over Simons Said no one ever I hate it 22/9 so far Beasting dedmon Hahaha I endorse this name change These suns jerseys look like something w WNBA team would wear Whiteside is also +23 gunz Booooo Nuggets win Booker so trash But look at the bright side space. You have one of the best young stretch 5's in the nba https://twitter.com/espnnba/status/1187942290737811457?s=21 Oh my god put him in the HOF now!!! This is? With Duncan Washington getting 20+ minutes? Duncan Robinson my bad See you don't even know him lol ?This guy played 23 minutes. Woof Lol I've literally never heard of that guy space ?I hate to break it to you but he's a 27% 3pt shooter Fax only https://twitter.com/pdxbrocialite/status/1187946724511244289 How many fouls are they gonna review as flagrant God just look at Caleb swanigan, and then try to imagine what Olshey was thinking when he picked him over Kuzma and Jordan Bell Lmao Bazemore with 9/7/5 and a +17 in 24 minutes off the bench. He's the anti turner I would love that gunz It could be possible I want nothing more than for Donovan Mitchell to suffer God remember when Troy Daniels almost single handedly knocked us outta the 2014 playoffs Haha so true Matt. Life comes at you fast Neil gets a cookie for those trades Good Neil I know I'm not feeling to good about it lol He's not even getting enough shots Over 10.5 points and 7.5 boards We could offer him an extension next summer Or wait til 2021 when he's a restricted FA He might be on the pistons in 3 months lol Sorry that's not funny Removed a laugh from Oh ehhhhh, got kicked off Illinois for choking his girlfriend Sounds like a bucket tho https://www.instagram.com/p/B4DIElZl7Zw/?igshid=1d6zo8r9v6w2r Matt/Cam you guys gonna cop? Could probably sell for at least a g ? I hate when people use the yellow one. Like you're not being insensitive to use your own color lol Hahaha https://twitter.com/jamiehudsonnbcs/status/1187961128732643328?s=21 https://twitter.com/espnfrontrow/status/1187823777108889600?s=21 Damn gundy didn't this chick just graduate like 2 years ago? She's from Portland yeah Auburn over LSU and Wisconsin over Ohio State would be real nice today boys Yeah I agree with space Then it's Alabama Clemson Ohio state or Oklahoma and one loss Oregon That's the problem with some 3 point specialists. They think they have to shoot it every time they get the ball in order to provide value The one he launched from the top of the key and air balled was so ill advised Yeah I'm hoping/guessing his minutes will be taken by a mid season trade or buy our candidate in 40 games This seasons Hood/Kanter That would be amazing. Terry needs to just throw little to the wild He's always so hesitant about playing rookies Thybulle and Grant Williams are already playing major minutes for Boston and philly Let it rip We$ is starting for Milwaukee Funny space cuz I thought Houston looked like pretenders Yeah idk. Just seems like the same team they've run back year after year When has Westbrook been conducive to winning tho I don't think it's a major upgrade from CP in terms of wins Oh for sure. But I don't think it's a move that catapults em in the playoffs or anything Same book different chapter Also I did not expect Oklahoma to lose but god damn that helps us a lot haha Lol 2 games in and Quick gets a boner I can relate Holy shit Mark You savage I usually only get that level of graphic on cam hanes instagram page https://twitter.com/nothinbutaction/status/1188151805110173696?s=21 Ian I'm pressed with this game Even scoring output And Meyers is -8 while the team plays well. Win win ?What a chain of events to follow Sorry for the jinx space Lol why would I say a heat win doesn't count? Not everyone is out to getcha I think Milwaukee is the best team in the east and the rockets are pretenders. Hasn't changed Wow Embiid already sitting out game 2. My bet ain't looking too good Dubov Brock Matt schaubs gonna beat the HOFer Russell Wilson? Lol Harden is 2-17 from three Mcshay hyping up your boy Herbert Clayton Can Dye wear some fucking gloves lol Oh boy. That didn't look like #1 pick material Jesus huge run and we miss the extra lmao Lfg! Was thinking the same thing big dawg Finish the tackle son! What a surprise. Butter fingers dye Wtf happens on this What a sequence of events Hopefully Dye is on his way to Dicks to get some damn gloves Herbert has some of the worst pocket awareness I've ever seen Suns beat the clippers?! "He's been ready to play this game since the first quarter!" Well I sure hope he was, Brian Luke Walton getting exposed for the fraud he is Lol yes It's just funny how some guys get anointed as the next big thing and it takes like 4 failures for people to finally change their mind I bet he gets at least one more HC job after this Wtf was that defense on both those plays Clips don't give af about their seed God catch a fucking pass I can't believe we don't have a dude who can kick a 50 yard field goal Lol I knew it was coming clay It hit verdell in the hands Yeah it could have been a better pass for sure Not a fan of that play calling on the first 2 How was that PI??? What the fuck We'll get a stop Interception to end it Okay match the fuck up Nah Stop here Fuck Should have been offensive PI. That was a 30 yard swing Good thing we have a killer kicker Go for the end zone. Our kicker has no balls Throw everyone off and go Verdell draw here This would be peak Oregon if we missed a 20 yarder lol Yeah throw the ball Go end zone Verdell swing out. Johnson run to the pylon Omg Cristobal you pussy Dude look at this kid!!! He's pissing down his leg We made a kick!!!!! We're a real football team!! He's definitely gonna bang a tri delt tonight God that PI call was giving me Michael dyer vibes So glad we pulled that out https://twitter.com/xxl/status/1188507432236048384?s=21 This is hilarious What is fournette pissed about? Lol that he tried to cut back from the 1 yard line Dumb ass run The bears Oh no Refs gonna ref Second time this season they've done that Sanders! Mark how hyped are you Man Tannehil is making Mariota look worse 2-0 as a starter All you that picked panthers +5 ? When you look up game manager, it's a picture of Kyle Allen Remember when everyone was penciling the Browns into the super bowl lol Steph sporting a -30 rn warms my heart They're prob missing the playoffs ^ that was for the browns but applies to the warriors too Charles certainly was I was 98% projected to win one my games today. Then the guy I'm playing had Edelman and Coleman play Gundy I'm bout to hand you your first loss Suck on that comish If the warriors keep sucking will they trade draymond? Space what do you think he'd fetch? Hezonja straight up? They should trade D Lo for more parts. Spread their dollars out more evenly Like get Teague, RoCo and a first or something from minny Right now their top 4 guys puts them at the luxury tax God Porzingis really is a unicorn Is anybody else's Espn app not working or is it just me Wtf Mine hasn't been working all day I think like another month DUBOV Wow idk why that was all caps https://twitter.com/orlandokgw/status/1188621517816381442 Shit Just a dislocation yeah? So a week to recover? Robinson with 15 space. I concede Okay gundy how long til we cut bait on Tolliver. -15 in 3 minutes Kenneth Faried is available. We got shootahs What a shitty call That happens every play Touch foul smh Omg That was on baze Terrible call CJ got me hard Who's gonna make me cum That Defense!! I'm ready! CJ iso time Two for one? I'd do it Fuck yes Calabro getting a little sexual "just like he's been doing all night. He puts his head down and then the explosion at the finish!" Challenge it! All ball! Hand is the ball too Yeah idk about that. Never heard that before I like this challenge stuff As long as it goes our way lol I think it's a jump ball Center court Same as an inadvertent whistle I believe so Oh yeah baby. That's the main thing coaches have been challenging Charges and stuff Kind of a quick foul call eh? Fuck yes!!!! Suck my dick Cuban!!! No only 1 per game lol His daddy woulda made it Holy shit Dallas shot 50 threes lol Gundy can we get Faried or someone? There's better 4's out there Dante Cunningham Amir Johnson So my buddy put $50 in Bovada on Thursday and turned it into $17k this weekend I will be trailing him from now on ? Mark for more context he got the initial deposit to $150 did a parlay to get $400 did a solo bet to get $800 then a solo to get $1800 then just started rolling it Hit 14 of 17 bets Cuban is angry tweeting https://twitter.com/alexkennedynba/status/1188846635444559872?s=21 Space appreciation tweet Who's getting the start at the 4 tonight gundy? Hezonja? Terry does love a good young guy vanity starter Play 12 minutes all game but still start That'd be kinda lit. Throw him out there Is whiteside not gonna guard LA? They've been starting LA at the 5 and Lyles at the 4 so far Yeah Poeltl only got 15 min off the bench both games so far. They've been going small Forbes, Murray, Derozan starting Can't believe Denver traded Mitchell for Lyles lmao Denver would be the hands down favorite if they just kept him Hahahaha yes They also drafted Gobert and traded him to Utah IIRC. They should probably never trade with Utah again lol Snyder is their bellicheck. If he wants the trade say no ?That ain't it Yes. He has literally done nothing positive Really?! Wow. That's an impactful 4 misses Really sticks out in your mind I also bet he's taken less than 4 dribbles. Dude just launches every time he gets the ball He's also -30 in 27 minutes this season. Is that good? What does draymond get in a trade? I'm not even gonna propose anything due to my blatant homerism Lol do most rookies give the reporter a secret recording of the entire meeting or something https://www.instagram.com/p/B4Kl0CCBkQq/?igshid=1qwku506k85nv Look at this fuckin bum Hahaha there's no way that is real Seriously? That's wild Can somebody explain what Tik Tok is How is it different than vine So it's just another fad? How long does it last Hmmm seems unlikely My old man take for the day I'm a big fan of the challenges. But agree with Brock. They need to be way faster. It's absurd the in game refs have to fire up a monitor and sit there and chat for 5 minutes Also they should have someone in the booth or HQ make the call. Remove any perceived in game bias from the refs on the court Final 4 seems likely. Rose bowl matchup ain't happening Our playoff fate lies in Harbaugh. Can he finally beat Ohio state? Why not think playoff? It's in play I just love getting let down if you can't tell I'm feeling good about our chances. Gonna be an interesting finish Someone needs to give Travis some gloves before he gets another carry Yeah he's an iron man He's played a full seasons worth of games more than AD. Same draft class This chick on the jump said KAT is the mvp favorite so far. Where do they find these analysts lol It's been 3 games fam chill Tolliver made a shot! Great end of quarter possession! Love that look! Read your fucking roster sheet spurs announcers. It's not Simmons smh Good look Dubov On the streaming site Classic CJ move Fuck you Tolliver!!! God what a heartbreaker Fucking Tolliver still pissed me off. He was wide open He's a specialist Oh for sure. But he's hit plenty to deserve a couple misses lol And Tolliver didn't have a man within 5 feet. Was stepping into it. He's just worthless https://twitter.com/anthonyvslater/status/1189014025813872641?s=21 God I hate draymond. Don't wanna trade for him anymore Lmao Sorry Tolliver. You left me no choice Hahahaha wow what a convo to wake up to My two arch nemesis ?It's a god damn blizzard out here boys ?More dumb Espn talking head takes. "Nobody talks about the Rockets bench. This is a deep team! They have Eric Gordon.." What is this bench you speak of When you actually listen to what lots of these guys say, they're pretty dumb takes lol Makes you really appreciate a Lowe, Russillo etc. Guys who actually watch games and aren't just prepping arguments for tv https://twitter.com/diannaespn/status/1189228220278640640?s=21 Adios red rocket https://twitter.com/cbssportsnba/status/1189233399975895042?s=21 This won't end well lol Too bad Bronny gotta get to the league ASAP before lebron retires Spicy liga is my favorite liga ?Me during this entire argument ?Racist old white men will argue against it space Right Eagle eye Dubov. Good call I've seen a lot of phantom whistles already this season. Refs are blowing the whistle anticipating a call regardless of whether it actually happens https://youtu.be/pwRdMZGqkgA Lol funny the Pats are signing him after he had this performance against the patriots ?Still can't see shit but boy is this fun to drive in ?Jeep Grand Cherokee Yeah I fuckin love it Dude you'll be hooked. They drive so smooth. I was deciding between that and a 4Runner and I liked the Jeep way better Supposedly they're gonna finally refresh the 4Runner in 2021 so I'm excited to see what they do But I'm a big Jeep fan now Yeah mark exactly haha. But apparently they're doing a full refresh on the tech specs and supposed to make it drive smoother. But 4Runner fans are such purists They're about the same length but I think the Jeep is a bit more compact overall yeah My neighbor has an SRT it's so dope Jimmy time? Damn matty ice with the life hacks You really emphasized your point with the period at the end too. I knew you were finished. Great delivery I just flipped it back to the Heat game and Nunn immediately hits a 3 He's kinda nice space Didn't he strangle his gf or something? Or am I making that up Holy fuck What the hell riles ?Geeze horrible headline on this article. Do you think she feels the impact as well? Ya know the one that got abused But yeah the dude is a hooper. He won 4 state titles at Simeon in Chicago Same Hs as drose and Jabari Parker And the legend Benji Wilson God Comcast fucking sucks. There's big time drama in Denver right now. Altitude which is the station that airs nuggets avs and broncos couldn't come to terms with Comcast, so it's just not carried anymore. But League Pass still blacks out the game locally So nobody can watch sports in Denver Local sports bars got cease and desist letters from the NBA and NHL because they were showing pirated streams haha https://twitter.com/dpostsports/status/1187909112081895424?s=21 What's worse is Comcast is still charging the $8/mo "regional sports fee", yet they aren't carrying the channel lol Please forward all of this to your dad Ian I'm outraged! Just checked Dubov, doesn't look like it I don't understand what they're haggling over. Dish and Direct tv are at an impasse with Altitude too Terrible call blue Right. He was right in the middle of the bag If his foot hit the inside corner maybe you have an argument All that to still get the call wrong Omg Fuck you to the crew Bryce Harper punching the air rn Scherzer gonna come on in relief and have a back spasm mid pitch Throw a softball up to altuve https://twitter.com/windhorstespn/status/1189379816069484544?s=21 Preach Windy! Bunch of people are replying saying to buy international league pass and use a vpn? Sounds like a lot of work Another said "plenty of food channels on tho" ?? Whitlock does suck He's the Candace Owens of sports ?Holy shit the Mavs had 9 players in double digits https://twitter.com/MeyersTracker/status/1187823811418189824 Lol Ian is this you? AD with a 40/20 game right now "Put some hot sauce on my burrito baby!" Was another great scene lol https://twitter.com/theathleticden/status/1185574021322010625?s=21 This was funny when I read it, and even funnier now ?Career 43% shooter joins the 50/40/90 club lol Lmao where do they get these Lol yeah gundy that Murray take was so bad. One of the most exclusive shooting milestones in the game and he's never even came close to two of those averages in one season Makes me feel good that every team has ridiculous homers tho lol I like to think I'm not that bad tho Except when I try trading Little for Blake Link me! Holdahl said they're not giving an update til we return to Portland So I'm not worried YET Lol true. With our history might as well expect the worse God don't say that. You're scaring me Also that article lists Denver needing a 3 lol. They have Barton, Craig, Grant and Porter What more do they need Unless windy considers porter and Grant 4's I'm still so pissed Denver got Grant. He's underrated af. Will probably start for Milsap at the 4 in a lot of games And how did they get him again? Oh yeah a team over the cap with no space but they absorbed him into the TPE created by trading Wilson Chandler You know who doesn't use their TPE's? Olshey Lol 4 games in Lol he's feeling the heat So many expectations Jackie mac the ?? Kyrie is insufferable Fuck him and KD It's shocking that those two sensitive ass dudes and Deandre Jordan who couldn't make up his mind in free agency and succumbed to peer pressure in one of the biggest moments of his life are all friends Don't forget our origins Matt!!! No way the browns make the playoffs I got Bills and Colts in before them They do still get the bengals twice, the broncos, and the cards Ravens and bills are losses tho That's 7 losses They gonna win out the rest? Random side note how did none of us get on Sounders +625 yesterday https://twitter.com/jimmykimmel/status/1189153270167564288?s=21 This is good lol "They did a lot of shooting. And they did a lot of blasting" lmao I think the blazers will every game so in my unbiased opinion, lock of the night! https://www.instagram.com/p/B4QV4b9lqsv/?igshid=12txud2vw3ccq In today's episode of irrational confidence https://t.co/PyPgkBYgdV?amp=1 https://twitter.com/claytravis/status/1189508753361702913?s=12 Collangelo 2.0 Lol I saw twitter was calling him "Ryan leaf with swag" 26.5 seems low af. I'd pick over that every single game https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1189695458630946819?s=21 Damn What'd it look like doctor? ACL? Achilles? Lmao dammit doctor! Rodney is gonna abuse CP in the post Wtf happened to the bucks Is whiteside still hurt? Ok good No defense in this rockets game No guy named Brad is gonna lead an nba team to 27 wins Brock Lol rockets This might go to OT Robert Sarver probably jerking off to the scoreboard right now https://www.instagram.com/p/B4RFiysl3bX/?igshid=1vlolpkzncakb Bryce Harper gotta be so pissed right now Fuck yes fire it up! I agree mark Dubov you ain't winning that easy Joel Embiid about to get a fat suspension. We didn't stipulate how being eligible would affect our games played bet I feel like Kiki is gonna bring the hammer down For all the off court stuff too. Nba is soft Wow 2 Democrats voted with the GOP today. Pussies I think it nullifies the bet. Action required He's not gonna be eligible to play! Lol injury and suspension are different But fine you'll get your money in May dubov I love futures I no longer believe in locks after last nights bucks debacle I put 50 on bucks ML. Now I can't go out to lunch today I'm punishing myself The rockets have won 3 games by a total of 8 points lol Those lucky fuckers I love it too space. Bout time they got a dose of reality They had the most fortunate run in nba history in terms of health and now they finally get to see what real teams feel like I know and then their opponents got key injuries during every run to the finals lol While they didn't have any That never happens So now they can't use the excuse that they have guys injured. Sucks to suck 2015: love and Kyrie out
2016: everyone healthy and they lose
2017: Zaza injures Kawhi 
2018: CP3 gets injured game 6 WCF Oh I agree But warriors Twitter was just funny cuz they would complain if they had a guy out injured Like other teams didn't have injuries Not saying they weren't a good team by any means Lol yeah if we had Nurkic healthy that would be awesome What's wrong with wanting teams to be full strength Yeah and the warriors had none. That was really lucky lol https://twitter.com/highkin/status/1189928444798230528?s=21 50/40/90 gundy? Lol Highkin > malika's sister https://twitter.com/shaepeppler/status/1189967350491205633 Ah the tried and true pump up PowerPoint. Ready to run thru a brick wall coach! Wow hot take. Never used keynote For real? Must be a creative thing. I've never used it my life Just PowerPoint or google slides But not to worry! Box allows users to choose their productivity tool of choice. Open a PowerPoint in keynote, or google slides in PowerPoint, it's all accessible in Box. Call me today for a free trial What's funny is we all use Macs. We delete keynote and everything. Company buys us a subscription for Office 365 to use PowerPoint etc. Yet Microsoft is our biggest competitor when it comes to OneDrive vs. Box. Maybe we shouldn't put money in our competitors pocket lol Yeah but I think we finally realized Microsoft has been bending us over. And Google hates them. So I think we're gonna start partnering with google more closely Yeah linked excel files are the life blood of finance teams Do you guys all use Gmail corporately? Or outlook? I feel like that's a generational/industry thing. Old school companies love outlook Interesting. I'd think creative firms would be all about Gmail Very true Brock And when I try bringing Box in to replace anything Microsoft, I'm often killing jobs. Sys admins and Sharepoint developers have staked their careers in knowledge of the Microsoft stack ?I talk about you guys every day dubov.

Gotcha gotcha https://twitter.com/shamscharania/status/1190026784382828544?s=21 Hell yeah. I'm still in business. Just a little load management Meyers with an early 5/5!

Let's hang a sign with all of the tweets that got us blocked by Meyers Mark wasn't your tweet something about soft serve ice cream lol I'm dying haha Legend From my short stint with the suns, prices are pretty set in stone, but they can throw in all kinda freebies If we said we were all Illinois alumni they 100% would do that lol I was thinking something like wristbands for the Buffett. Or sit court side during shoot around Beer for sure Omg cards Yeah buffet opens like 60 min before the game What'd you bet at? 10.5? It's almost like he wasn't qualified to be and nfl head coach in the first place God you gotta love John lynch Just drafted D lineman in the top 10 like 4 years in a row.

This game has been dope I was like wtf is bron doing driving it I was so lost Mavs should have fouled him I support that Cuban drafting his tweet about the refs as we speak How was Luka not the #1 pick lol Imagine Luka and Booker Lebron playing like he's 25 Big fan of grey beard bron Can't wait til he's 40 and throwing oops to bronny Losses from Houston and Utah tonight. Gotta love that ?Wow that's a hell of graphic! Mighty Mouse woke up this morning with no idea SVP was gonna drag him on national tv https://www.instagram.com/p/B4WXYjpgSsr/?igshid=1lpjeez9f9gmk I totally missed the the hold by Dwight on Curry to free up the shot lol https://twitter.com/mcuban/status/1190489555343945728?s=21 Here we go! Angry cubes No Collins tonight. I'm starting to think Gundy was right I'm sure that's what the dilemma is And whiteside is questionable Tolliver/Skal frontcourt baby! We might need Rengel off the bench This turner shultz Conor Barcelona trip is making for some great instagram content ?Nobody believes!! Go utes https://twitter.com/jwquick/status/1190800778346106880?s=21 Fuck Tolliver starting out hot!! God Tolliver really is new Meyers for me. There's no reason he should be in the nba nonetheless starting for the best team in the league Can we call up Thomas Robinson? Let's run it back God dammit and there goes my Andrew luck bet God what a dime Is he a HOFer already? Maybe! I got Utah ML and Oregon ML. Stopping while I'm ahead No match for the best team in the NBA. Your Portland Trail Blazers Fuck I'm gonna have to suit up at this rate Jesus fucking Christ Portland Dame ?? LFG I'm sensing he pulls a lebron and the defense sucks in. He kicks to CJ for the game winner Omg Let's go!! Young Simons!! I half called that Fuck Jesus Christ How do you let him get that wide open Un fucking real Complete bull shit I'm gonna go find the bottom of a bottle Totally agree Also there's only 2 seconds. The guy guarding the inbounded should help deny the corner pass He's not gonna inbound it and get the ball back with 2 seconds. Not enough time Masvidal looking cocky as hell I love it Weak ending https://twitter.com/adamschefter/status/1191088873666961409?s=21 Hahahaha not his dream job!!! Fuckin snake We leveled up with Cristobal! It's almost like the guy with a career losing record wasn't cut out for a top 25 program. Who would've thought $17 million He cashed out Always makes me laugh how teams sign these long terms contracts with coaches. Who were they negotiating against that they had to give him 6 years? It was clear as day Willie wanted to go to FSU tho. Shoulda called his bluff Or hire someone else. It wasn't saban they were luring away He didn't wanna sign with adidas and live in dames shadow for the rest of his life Wtf are the Seahawks doing Holy shit haha God Russell Wilson is sick Give him the gold jacket now Hahaha recall my take was not that he won't be a HOFer. It's that he's not a HOFer if his career ended today Just wanna qualify that Also Ian I'm very happy for the success of the Heat right now. I'm gonna live vicariously thru you this year. The blazers injury situation is already depressing me Also are the rockets gonna have the worst defense in the league this year? They already gave up 158 in regulation and the Heat have 70+ at halftime lol They'll be in a battle for the worst If the hawks kicker didn't doink an XP earlier we'd have a W already I agree Brock. Steph got off easy too. He was gonna have such a rough year trying to carry this squad and now he gets off without people questioning his ability to carry a team Yep. Literally best case scenario for them Fucking pussies Russell!! Let's go But guys don't forget, one thing in our favor is the new flattened lottery odds. Warriors could easily win 10 games and get the 6th pick Yeah I actually love the new odds Meyers: hero or goat? Here we go Someone getting cut on Monday I have hawks ML I'm gonna murder him Yeah Freddie gone Fuck yes Eagles & Hawks ML parlay hitter Gimme dat Are the Pats winning tonight? Haha omg. Meyers is doing good? are we in the upside down https://twitter.com/kennyunfazed/status/1191156927071424512?s=21 Great movie dubov Doncic with back to back 15 assist triple doubles ?? Sounds enticing I love the strobe effect after td's ?Jalen Rose The Godfather called it 

Mark Ingram 100+ yards ?
Earl Thomas INT ?
Ravens win ? Only 1 TD. But that's pretty damn close https://twitter.com/darrenrovell/status/1191210759302332417?s=21 This is gonna be gundy one day. "Mystery bettor hits 12 team parlay. Turns $5 into $1.1 million" Lol that would be amazing if he wasn't actually a billionaire Remember he's lost billions and billions of dollars after becoming president I reached out to my guy and got no response. Sales must be good lately Yeah there's no free beer lol. Unless someone royally hooks us up Guys the Phoenix suns have a better record than us When is it time to panic Hopefully we get a fat load (management) on Wednesday from the Clippers Is Zach gonna be out a couple weeks? Or a couple months? Jesus fuck We don't have any big men lol Well we still have an open roster spot I believe. Don't we only have 14 right now? I want an old head retread Gimme Faried Can Chris bosh run up and down the court without collapsing? Our 3 losses are against Denver, San Antonio and Philly. All playoff teams And two of them were at the buzzer Not terrible Space tell me we're good Oh Steph is playing tonight? Lol I was joking. Saying Steph sucks Oh fuck idk Lemme g chat Aaron Levie real quick ? Should I send it ?He actually messaged me once lol. Apparently he likes big boi Update coming in 15 minutes Dubov. I've escalated this to the ivory tower for you Of course! If you could please send a note to my Vice President of sales that would be fantastic At least we're not Slack Mark. They had to pay $8 million in credits to customers last quarter for failing to meet up time SLA's lol God Fucking dammit. $100k deal I'm working on and the customers CIO just emailed me "can't move all our storage to Box if this keeps happening" *starts looking at jobs on linkedin* Hahahaha That's too accurate Brock I my mind I'm like "why can't the engineering team pound on their keyboard a few times and fix this! Wtf guys" Does Pau Gasol even have a timeline gundy? Ok that's good https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1191409674656059392?s=21 What do you think the last book Trump actually read was? Sauce town stand up!! What does a punter do between jobs? I just picture him chillin at his house. Go kick some balls in the backyard in the morning. Crush some afternoon beers and wait for someone to call you Look at the mother-----r K-Nunn. Look at him. Hes got so much of me in him that its scary because his confidence continues to grow, Butler told Yahoo Sports. Jimmy Butler with an incredible humble brag Guy has cement blocks for feet. If he had to slide laterally to take a bullet for his other dog, it'd be dead too Your two random stats of the day

1. Derrick Rose is 4th in the league in usage (35%)
2. Meyers Leonard is 2nd in the league in 3pt % (61%) shooting 8-13 so far What happened again? Wow That's fucked I got a text from my buddy yesterday "dude can you spot me 900 bucks til I get paid Friday? I lost a grand on a bet last night and I told my wife I wouldn't bet for a few weeks so I need to replace that before she looks at our account" Lol Gambling is a helluva drug Your live clippers bet has inspired me How are the 76ers only -2 against Phoenix tonight? That sounds like a gundy lock of the night Yeah he is dubov Lol don't give Sarver so much credit. It's been 6 games Ayton out too tho I'm gonna pump the brakes all the way on that one Even tho Monty is my boy They're still the suns Lfg I still have Paul George on ice too What's Zion's timeline? Christmas? https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1191476463817707520?s=21 Lol he hasn't started a game since... last year ?100 level for 30 bucks ?? Hahahaha I found myself a Denver girl From the workplace. Real old fashion Omg a fucking labrum tear. He barely got touched!!! Paper tiger Trade his fucking ass For lebron Unreal man 3 weeks ago terry was saying this is the deepest team he's ever had and now we're gonna have the guy sitting in 112 row C suit up at power forward Who we trading I texted my dad that Collins is done and he goes "shit! We need Meyers back!" Honestly my biggest fight to pick with terry at this point is his resistance to play young guys. He's gotta show some faith Nas was also projected to go in the lottery. This isn't some mid 2nd round guy Wtf are we doing Mark did that pussy jim Barnett get the boot this year? Man This sucks I don't think we're gonna cover guys I'm most worried about our D Fucking scrubs are putting 120 on ya God Fucking dammit This is infuriating I'm buying a jimmy jersey I can't stand this heartbreak It's like getting dumped and kicked in the face every single night of my life I want my last name on it lol No all star for you CJ! But you know who is gonna make it... Donovan Mitchell Now I'm really jumping off a cliff We suck Ruining dames prime with shorty performances like this Running out old man Tolliver We're a laughing stock The warriors are literally a g league team I can't even show my face tomorrow I'm gonna bite someone's head off tomorrow at the water cooler Idk gundy. I'm waving the white flag Just take me out back and end it Yes and I eternally hate Robert Sarver now Can't do it Oh I'm not going anywhere. I like to just speak the worst case scenario so I'm only slightly let down next time https://twitter.com/kyleclark/status/1191539751750447104?s=21 Let's all take a break and laugh at this nerd Hahahaha https://www.instagram.com/p/B4ensyMAWHM/?igshid=1537fl63d6f1w Matt you called it Damn John Collins popped for roids too John still the better Collins tho I like how they always say "unknown to me" The Barry bonds defense still lives on! when in doubt deny deny deny Fuck it sign him up Him and dame can have rap battles on the plane Who added John Witherspoon to the chat Ask mark about lebron and Dwight Howard Alright I talked to a guy I know with the blazers and best thing available is Rip City Row. We could get 14 tickets for $1,134 ($81 per guy). It's 200 level. Comes with $10 food voucher. And he could take us court side to watch warm ups an hour before the game if we wanted Or we could swap the warm ups idea for something else. I asked what other freebies he could hook it up with Or for any Portland guys I could press him for his personal tickets to another game this year. And you throw some money toward beer for the group How about several of you say you're Illinois alums and we get a meet up with Meyers and Nunn ?Mr. 50/40/90 himself! Gundy I'm gonna @ malika's sister every day with updated stats Haha I haven't been blocked in awhile. Could use some excitement https://www.instagram.com/p/B4ft7NqBZ_1/?igshid=6iw3lh7br8r4 I'm not worried about Zach at all anymore! We just needed the hammer to speak! https://twitter.com/shamscharania/status/1191816387825717248?s=21 Just say season ending and spare me the attempt for positivity lol He ain't coming back Let's just tank. Race the warriors to the bottom Is it time to call melo with our tail between our legs? Tolliver ain't it man We need help ASAP Lol I was kidding about melo I'm trying to illustrate our dire situation But Tolliver is absolutely ass Yes. We are fucked We need Faried At least he's an nba player Tolliver should retire Lol Ian that'll get us back to .500 We'll need a 14 game win streak to mean anything I mean he could if he was playing. Couldn't have predicted the injury Just shitty luck Lol he's better than Aminu space We don't have anything to trade for anyone right now lol We don't even have salary to match man 80% of the cap is tied up in whiteside dame and CJ Bazemore is worth more to us than anyone else I'm talking a salary dump move from another team gunz But say there's a team that has a guy like Kelly O that's serviceable but they don't want him on the books. We couldn't even take anyone like that lol You need middle ground contracts to match those scenarios That's what was nice about Harkless and Meyers deals Maybe we're like the SF giants and we just succeed every other year. We'll get swept as the 8 seed this year then go to the finals next year Throw in bazemore! I still wanna figure out a way to get LA I think if we don't find a trade for Baze and/or whiteside this year, we just bring em back at a much lower number next year. Whiteside / healthy nurk would be legit Swing the pendulum the other way. Oldest team in the league! Okay space seriously, give me a trade idea for Love Curious what you think is fair Yeah Love to Portland Fair. It's not always that black and white tho. They're also trading for salary relief Love's contract is a net negative I was thinking Whiteside, Trent and 2 firsts Or swap Trent for Little Fair fair The market is always fickle. Bidding wars start quick Could also be bone dry Wow real Maroney take by me there I think Dame is getting old enough it's time to start leveraging our picks and play for the present https://twitter.com/notoriousohm/status/1191884011007668225?s=21 Sick Lakers better come back or imma have a date with the bottom of this bottle of casa migos I gotchu Sorry I didn't go to the game tonight. I got tix to see the flat earther play the nuggets next Thursday tho Who the fuck even is that guy Is Dwight a top 5 center again?? I love overreacting on small samples It's literally my fav thing But he looks great No homo (Gotta say that cuz Dwight) ?Not drowning in tequila after all ???? What are we betting on tonight boys Gundy I'm on the same wavelength I think Orlando could even pull off a win today. +7.5 points is even safer Bovada has the MIL game up for like an hour after kawhi was announced out at -110. I Should've hammered that one True Bev and trez don't give af about no load management https://apple.news/A0HPYD9lRQHOwJd9Ypm2f9w Fun fact: the MET police of London use Box for all their CCTV footage. Good thing we didn't have an outage then so they could catch the guys Lol yeah he was like what are you clowns doing I bough a point and got em at +3 lmao So stoked rn Love it ?I've been sticking to 2 teamers Lol funny listening to jay williams complain about how teams just move on if players get injured. And used himself as an example Dawg you wrecked a motorcycle you didn't have a tragic ACL tear No shit but it's his own fault. He's talking about load management and players putting it all on the line for teams that can move on at any moment Terrible example. He did that to himself Give us the deets! If we never hear from gundy again we know what happened They share a bank account, have the exact same tattoos and jumped a guy at a high school basketball game they thought was trying to holler at their mom You are correct gundy lol Ian are the heat gonna be the powerhouse suns tonight Beat* https://twitter.com/adamschefter/status/1192553273351450624?s=12 Lol I've been holding onto this guy in 2 leagues for this 1. Step Brothers
2. Anchorman 
3. Old School
4. Talladega Nights
5. Elf
6. Kicking and Screaming 
7. Blades of Glory
8. The other guys Don't @ me Anchorman is just as quotable as step brothers Dude kicking and screaming was pretty funny lol I love Mark wahlberg and the other guys was still so so for me. The tuna scene was hysterical everything else was eh Gators bitches always wear jimmy's is pretty damn good tho. Still use that one Do we need to trade whiteside already Protect dame at all costs Whiteside is so dumb Bring back Meyers!! Gundy I can't watch the game right now what's TNT crew saying about whiteside? Is it that bad? Did they really call him stupid? They aren't wrong. But that's embarrassing God damn. Things are going south fast Get Whiteside out of Portland ? Tolliver = ?? We're fucking 3-5 rn guys god dammit Are we gonna miss the playoffs Do we blow it up Houston plays Eric Gordon 37 minutes off the bench in 3 guard lineups. We could do the same But they also suck at defense lol We could kinda use Moe and Chief. Their brick 3 pointers and all I want Little Start him over Tolliver Hezonja 1-9. Woof Thanks dudes!! Haha I'll be knees deep in casa migos and corona tonight. Can't wait Maybe some Panda Express tomorrow morning mark My favorite lunch spot by this start up mark and I used to work at in the Bay was called "Asian Box". I giggled every time I said the name Thanks my fellow sneaker head Hahahahaha I'm dying Literally best case scenario for them Plus they get young guys experience this year to see who can contribute off the bench next season Dame cut from a different cloth Exactly Most durable guard in the league ?Lol Palladino just sent me this gem. Odds I end up like this tonight? Guys I'm fucking hammered. What happened? Dame set the franchise scoring record? Lost 50 bucks on the blazers fuck Omg So we should tank with the warriors Oh man. I woke up with so much energy randomly. And now I feel like a freight train ran over me I'm struggling. Trying to find the nearest chipotle. Or panda ?Success ?I feel alive. Keeping the beers flowing now Power stance Hair is looking great for end of the night mark https://twitter.com/ACTIONBETSWins My buddy uses this book They let you cash out same day in Apple Pay Maybe don't give Mariota a new offensive coordinator every single season too Kinda hard to develop an offense He should come to Denver next year Hahaha Are we missing the playoffs? Suns are smashing the nets rn 3-6 is real bad At least Simons looks good Surprised dame is starting the 4th. Not a good sign against the Hawks First implosion of the dame era JJ hickson squad was better than this Space are you reveling in our pain He's not an nba player That ain't it ?Checking in on Mr 50/40/90 https://twitter.com/shamscharania/status/1194016416183279616?s=21 Everybody getting hurt ?Dame MVP Lol I know Dame is ballin tho. Better efficiency then Bron Shooting 50/40/90 thus far Dame also leading the league in win shares Just need team record to be better Top 3 team putting up the stats he is now for a whole season and he could absolutely win Now we won't be a top 3 team anyway so it's all fantasy lol Crazy ending. I thought Pete was an idiot for not going for it on 4th & 2 with 2 minutes left. Can't believe they got the ball back after that Dame gonna be the last man standing lol Dame vs Eric paschall showdown in the WCF https://twitter.com/omaroneybig3/status/1194275739295596551?s=21 Maroney moves! No bagley either yeah? Give that the ol Meyers Leonard ?? It's bad Dubov We don't got shootahs We're dead last in the league in assists per game Dame ISO's more than harden out of necessity ?This might be the worst bench since we were rolling out Luke Babbitt nightly We actually don't give up the most 3's. We're decent. But our defense is trash Offense ain't much better And our rebounding is atrocious compared to years past Is it time to panic yet? Why would they give us either player lol I agree with space. We're a far tier below anyone contending out west The thing is a whiteside trade falling into place, getting everyone back full strength and it's a totally different story D'antoni has shown you really only need a strong top 6 We might have to already start looking to next year tho lol. Nurk and Zach aren't gonna give us anything this year And we can't do much without them If we can trade for Love/gallo with whiteside picks and little. We're in good shape next year I hate Jordan Clarkson Thompson is nice tho ?This would be next year with a trade and we'd have a $200m payroll lol I hate admitting it but we should have kept aminu Let's be honest tho. What's gonna happen is we're gonna be 10 games under .500 at the All Star break. Dame is gonna go supernova and drag us to a 13-3 March. We finish the season crazy optimistic and sneak into the playoffs at 43-39 only to lose 4-1 in the first round Rinse and repeat next year Good he sucks Brock what's your Kodak allegiance I actually like his music too I just think he's a bitch cuz he walked out of an interview when they asked him about sexually assaulting someone and he was talking shit about Lauren London right after nipsey died ??????? That's fair Lol Jim Jordan is the biggest fucking loser in Congress Anybody watching the impeachment hearings Jim Joe Paterno Jordan Apparently Trump's favorites are; Nunes, Mark Meadows and Matt Gaetz. Tells you all you need to know about those 3 lol McCarthy is so dumb it's kinda funny. Guy has an IQ of like 12 ?Name the guy in the middle Gundy wins I had one of those horizontal team posters with Barkley on it when I was in like 2nd grade. I just assumed he was related to Charles at the time Didn't have internet so just had to make up my own facts Let's trade him for Blake straight up https://www.instagram.com/p/B41MS6BhFKi/?igshid=1ojdgll6ypzi2 They sure don't have a Michael dehaan at quarterback Haha nobody would throw on us!! Pick every time https://twitter.com/fredkatz/status/1194778246887411713?s=21 Hey guys We still suck I feel like Siakam has gotten mad hype He just got a max contract I've heard mvp talk for him That's Vegas I'm talking basketball pundits lol Opinions of pleebs They just pick a number that gets equal action on both sides Doesn't mean it's representative Lol dude my statement had nothing to do with gambling I'm talking people who write about basketball, talk about basketball for a living, have given Siakam mad props. He was pre season rated a top 20 player. And he got a max contract Bettors are different We're fighting in diff arenas right now lol God we suck ? ? https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/27691396/ranking-best-players-nba-season-30-11%3Fplatform%3Damp Lol okay ESPN had him ranked 22 ahead of Blake griffin Your hot take was Luke warm as fuck This is revenge for my Lavar ball take 2 years ago Suck on that space! Lol so people who pre season ranked him 22 aren't giving him respect cuz he should have been ranked above dame and PG? That's your take Okay lol That's top 10 area Which he'll be next year. That's why you play the games 22 was mad respect off one season of 2nd banana I'm a fan. You don't gotta sell me Lol I won't concede that Properly rated pre season Max contract Vegas is diff from basketball pundits I digress I just think selecting one random game, looking at the line, and making an assumption about how an entire league and country view a player is ridiculous lol that's all There's terrible lines across the league every night Also when does the line apply to one player only You're trying to say that Toronto +2 in November means Siakam is criminally underrated? Gimme a break He gets made love. People that watch basketball know he's legit If you're talking about one game then sure lol they didn't get respect Was that it? Lol Did I manufacture an argument I thought the top 5 mvp take was your arguemenr That's a soft take is what I was saying Cuz that's pretty unanimously accepted But if the line was all you were saying then yes I agree it was bad lol I would say so. But people could argue AD and Joker are all interchangeable Luka is unreal I'm in a fragile state It's panic time for Portland Dame looking around seeing a bunch of scrubs It's cuz we didn't do the San Diego trip this year There's no chemistry! No fortnite parties at Meyers house ?? I saw this morning that baker was complaining about home crowd noise. He told them to be quieter so people could hear the snap count lol Fuck I totally missed the bred 11 drop today smh Ah gotcha Apparently they did a shock drop today? I'm probably gonna rock em If I can cop https://twitter.com/leannestuck/status/1194795900360638464?s=21 Kid speaking straight facts Kid likes fried chicken https://twitter.com/bleacherreport/status/1195123155188084736?s=21 Lmao They literally could have just traded Kristaps, Knox, Robinson and a couple firsts And had AD and RJ I'll follow you space Wait it's halftime What fucking time zone are they playing in That's what separates good from great tho Ian I always gotta root for a fellow Butler https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1195158126904913920 Holy shit!!! Drastic times call for drastic measures This is epic. We're America's team now Melo Redemption run I'll take the HOFer bum Pippen 2.0. Minus the defense https://www.instagram.com/p/B43lL3Pqu8X/?igshid=1nscl6vviwj0c Glorious Except take off 7 ?Current view I met Larry Steele at hoopla one year. Cool guy Lebron buying the team is shaping up perfectly. Melo is gonna have a career revitalization. Play 3rd fiddle when we make a finals run next year and become blazer legend. Lebron buys the team in 5 years and Melo takes front office role Dubov tell me you can see it too 23 And a game winning J after 6 jab steps Melo getting Houman to contribute a years worth of texts in one night is enough satisfaction for me Especially since she got killed in power. She doesn't have anything else to do Spoiler alert Dude I fucking love Power Tommy is the man https://www.instagram.com/p/B43q99kjSvg/?igshid=2r2htipiof34 19? Oh hell no. Joel Freeland did not die for this Imagine if we had Melo and Pau 5 years ago It's all shaping up for game 7 WCF against the Lakers. Except this time dame throws an oop to a cutting Melo and we win in dramatic fashion. Avenging ghosts of Portland past Baze = Bonzi Hood is lefty Steve smith Hezonja is Schrempf Omg it's happening Zach comes back. White sheed He's got some crazy in him Sonic legend Detlef Schrempf Him and Chris Mullen carried the white boy flat top torch Wait did anybody hear Meyers is renting Whitesides house in Miami? Lol Total Meyers move I'll give Republicans this, they're good at sticking to their talking points. Say the same shit enough and people assume it's true Nunes opening statement is literally the same thing it was on Wednesday https://twitter.com/darrenrovell/status/1195368525612879872?s=21 Gundy you didn't tell us you went on another heater last night Is Rudolph really considering pressing charges? Lol Mercer island boys don't fuck around I just realized I'm gonna get to see Melo in a blazers uniform and his return to Denver Video tribute?? Same Also Threw them in a 10 team parlay in solidarity with gundy ? Gundy get on this action with me. I'm feeling lucky I'm not a fan either Cam. Not sure what they were going for there I think the 4's and 5's were pretty dope The bape 4's were fire Olajuwon pin striped champion jersey I either was a fan of the post game or it was the cheapest jersey at the store Fan of cocaine early on huh space. I respect it Hornets game winner! Shoulda trailed me and space Big dawg gets the caboose No Melo means guaranteed loss Odd fan I'm confused What's the basis of his Kobe hate. I'm genuinely curious now Was it the rape? His style of play? Does he think they should have kept shaq? Does he not like winning? Haha yeah he carried them to 2 more ships post shaq during Duncan's prime, the Celtics big 3, and lebron beginning to peak Yeah I had to double take that Washington has been filling it up this year Getting 100 shots up in a game is impressive We need gallo And JR Gimme all former Knicks and nuggets https://twitter.com/rrinehart2012/status/1195153239945236481?s=21 This is great Also great was luck of the Irish when he slaps in a half court game winner Cam loves the Asian cuisine https://youtu.be/rz5TGN7eUcM Gundy saying apparently twice in the same sentence Chase young should probably be the pick I like how the Niners picked d lineman in the top 10 like 4 years in a row. Now their D is elite And one of them was a bust Wait so Kap changed the workout location last second? What's going on Wouldn't* allow media correct? Seems fair for him to bail then Gotcha. Just wanted to make sure I was following Seems very dramatic tho I'm not sure if he's purposely being stubborn or if Goodell is being a cock sucker Or maybe a little of both Interesting Clay Travis is gonna have a field day with this Oh yeah for sure. Fuck the shield The whole 2 hour ultimatum was so strange too Damn Tua done for season Gimme Kap in Denver Yeah I agree with Clayton If he slides, bellicheck will trade up and get him Shoulda went 33. Really embraced the Pippen 2.0 vision https://twitter.com/jtfoz/status/1195719928961273856?s=21 Should've shared this earlier. I apologize Harden really is going full Kobe this year 38 points on 34 shots True Hoosiers moment You could tell pop came to the arena ready to get tossed. He was rocking the t shirt/sport coat combo Pop is a genius. Fires up his team while he's hitting the apricot blondes from the locker room couch Melo emerges from the tunnel in a hoodie. Scores 17 in the 4th to save us Sorry I fell asleep for a sec Deja vu of last game against San Antonio I hit blazers ML 700 Dylan ride with me Did you hit it?! Let's go Dylan! Might bust my first nut of the season V cool mark We eatin Blazers up 1 with 37 seconds. Becky Hammond tryna becomes the first woman to win a challenge Becky with the good hair. Unsuccessful Gives us a 2 for 1 That might be the worst challenge ever That's what Derrick white gets for tryna tell me what to do at camp Hahah I should use that thread for my thoughts on each game ?Not gonna lie I went on a serious cold streak. Account was dry. Used my 2.08 in bonus funds at +700. Were back in business boys Baylor +400 anyone?? Buy that down to -1 Lol yeah man Dropped 33 game 1 That was one of those games, after watching hundreds of blazer games, I could just tell we were gonna come back Dylan what are we hittin next Besides these corona lights I'm putting back ?I love live bets Just got fucking hyped watching Evan turner hit 2 free throws with 0.4 seconds left in the 2nd quarter. Hawks win the quarter by 1 Is Sam Jacobs a Hollywood Star now He's always "filming shoots" on the gram He looks like the cop that clears the crime scene and gets 7 seconds of screen time in an episode of NCIS Los Angeles Wait referencing lines from tv and film in conversation is a skill?! So all my years of dropping random anchorman quotes should be compensated?? Hahahah Rengel I'm crying Don't forget Jamie foxx Motherfucker Jones I'm honestly surprised he didn't add intramural champion to his resume "Single handedly built basketball court at my frat" ?Humble rook https://twitter.com/covers_vegas/status/1196121816013475842?s=21 Gundy chill bro damn!! What are we betting on today boys? Dylan any +800 locks? Texans +365 only down a tug Same gundy Glad I avoided that Vikings live bet was today's blazers bet 49ers ML Down 10-0 hammer it https://www.instagram.com/p/B4-qvYAg4sY/?igshid=1dp5msdwoeq2c Lol Meyers you ain't bron Alright guys I'm no spaceman, but I just turned $2 into $140 and I'm pretty stoked on that Only took 4 bets Blazers ML +700
Hawks 2Q ML +275
Saints/Cowboys ML parlay -150
Pats/Raiders ML parlay -110 Funny too cuz the hawks lost by 50. Only won one quarter and it was the 2nd quarter by 1 point lol I got you Space Dylan wizards +1600 live right now! Hammer time! Holy shit they're only down 1! Haha guys pay your dues Especially you Dylan. You haven't paid live out in years Omg are we gonna DA space Not gonna like I think I'd vote no. He bring a lot to the group Just saying Ian if you got kicked out of the group chat would we ever talk again? I would probably text you for gambling advice Ian the group was started as a fantasy basketball chat Now you don't wanna pay your fair share I see how it is Why is his physical 2 days long The ol trump physical eh. Multiple stages I love that Dwight is lovable again Quite the Redemption story Damn the Nuggets TV (altitude) and Comcast ain't getting resolved anytime soon. Altitude sued Comcast saying they're purposely holding out to eliminate altitude as a network or purchase them at a severely discounted rate Space your dad works for the devil! They worked out a deal with direct tv! But yes Kroenke fucking sucks dick But no Dish or Comcast yet The Walmart heirs are cheap fuckers. Who would have thought haha You think he gets cut mid season Dubov? Yeah I'm cautiously optimistic I agree with you gunz. I think Neil was telling Melo we saved him and they're on the same page That said Melo is Melo Who knows what could happen I'm happy for Dwight If only he had this realization 5 years ago Definitely. Dude is in insane shape He'll be able to grab 10 boards a night when he's 45 Haha I forgot how much you hated this signing. Touch I mean history says it won't. But we got nothing to lose IMO What gundy said I will say this for the 237th time. Anthony Tolliver is not an NBA player And the fact that he was starting for us! Is Calabro turning into mike rice in front of our eyes Good call space Jesus Let's go I hit bucks & chiefs ML parlay tonight. -144 ? I'm an intrigued for Melo but no dame I'm feeling a broy Mavericks playoff performance Just got 100 level tix to nuggets blazers in 2 weeks. $30 each haha Were the scrubs coming to town https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1196924986335907846?s=21 Oh baby I'm gonna need to change my pants tonight. I can feel it coming Hell fucking yeah Talk dirty to me Terry Dubov gonna eat crow when Melo drops 16 tonight Portland +3 now. Hammer time Gotta get his sea legs under him. 28 in game 2 Over under 2 jab steps before he pulls the trigger? Wow Ingram is playing. The bad news keeps coming Oops sorry Lot of liga action tonight I just did the same matty It's like the super bowl But better No box out from Melo. Dubov is fuming Let's go!!! 3 ball Whiteside not a great passer 00 "your name" is Well guys I don't think we're gonna win +20 in our hearts Portland's own Gary Sondland! He don't give af He's the savior we needed. National hero If Nunes, Jordan and Ratcliffe all put their heads together. They could create one semi competent person Cue the "I've never even met the guy" defense Lol Nunes immediately resorts to conspiracy theories. Completely ignoring the aide. This is great So they're shifting from "he didn't do it" to "okay well he did it but it wasn't illegal" in real time Omg now they're saying okay well none of this happened on the July 25th call! Like that's the only day that crimes can't be committed Wait I'm sorry Dubov is that a real photo?? Holy fuck haha that is hilarious It looks like a 9 year old wrote that The republican counsel is so cringe worthy too lol. How is this the best lawyer they had Lol Sondland said he cant find White House record of a call he had with trump. More cover ups So republicans best defense is that the "I want no quid pro quo" statement from Trump came on September 9th. Same day he learned of the whistleblower complaint. Not following through with the crime cuz you got caught, doesn't make it not a crime https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1197242556632961024?s=21 Eric trump ain't letting a money making moment pass #AlwaysBeClosing Wait Pompeo is resigning now? ? https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1197272317681963010?s=21 https://twitter.com/shamscharania/status/1197274895153012736?s=21 https://twitter.com/bennyjohnson/status/1197199999282507776?s=21 Someone should tell this guy what receipts are Isn't there a way they can do a private vote in the senate? If republicans didn't have to put their name on it I guarantee several flip Kentucky won a democratic gubernatorial too Me neither Dubov Except once I did put my luggage in the overhead in first class when I saw it was filling up in the back. I felt so badass That's amazing I love friendly cocaine addicts Did I tell you when I shoulder tapped a guy in the bathroom in Denver? Real dumb and real awkward but turned into an amazing night I was seeing SNBRN at this club. Had an urge, tapped a guy on the shoulder as he was leaving a stall with another guy and said "you look like you're from Miami eh" (my pickup line for do you have coke). He goes are you a cop? I'm like no I got girls too bro. He says come find me with the girls. 

I find him after I get the ladies. He's at a table next to the DJ booth I'm like fuck this isn't gonna work. He sees me and the girls, waives me up. Gives us bumps and all the liquor we want the rest of the night 30 minutes later were high fiving and raging our faces off like best friends. Worked out great! Yeah he's super cool actually. He owns a dispensary in Denver. We actually met up after that too. Real cool guy Networking! Also, the girls thought I was the coolest guy ever that night, getting us free drugs liquor and a table haha. Could not have worked out better ?To finish the story. He made me take a picture of him and the girls. His name is David. The end Haha girl on the right is my gf now Haha I didn't meet her that night but I think I looked so cool for that she agreed to keep seeing me. I'll credit ol David with an assist one this one "Must own a crowbar and revel in inducing pain" https://twitter.com/saosasha/status/1197320791706263552?s=21 It's pretty catchy actually haha No dom David Airbnb? Classic We all do it at some point ?My buddy that won $16k off 50 bucks is getting kicked off one of his books haha I advocated for some colorful language Hahahaha Yeah FOH with that perspective Omg How much we losing by? 30? Okay 50 I'm gonna go pick up padingtons and a 12 pack of corona light. Talk to you guys tomorrow Yeah buddy. Heading back to Denver in the morning tho People that aren't from salem just don't get it. It's strange I don't even know how to describe it to people ?Don't forget about Oliver Miller space He was all natural. No workouts needed Pat is going down with patty mills and will Barton as guys we developed then promptly got rid of so other teams could enjoy the fruits of our labor Hey 7 points 4 boards 2 assists last season! On a 60 win team He's no Donte Robinson but still legit What are these numbers Brock Dylan blazers +1800! It's a lock! lol gotcha gotcha Tolliver!!! Holy fuck he sucks! Get this man outta the league Jesus Christ Executive of the year. Crown him now! Melo really fucked up his youngest team in the league narrative Tolliver great box out! Picture perfect! I wanted us to trade CJ to sac for the #2 pick and get Luka That woulda been lit Can't believe they took bagley lmao ?Quick search says gundy was hot on the beat as well ??A tale of two acts I thought +1800 ML was the lock of the day Bring back the etrade baby Ian ?Let's get rich boys Mark deja vu To Stanford at home Kraft cheese bowl here we come! Shoulder to shoulder with angry Eugene locals in their 40's We were just being real! Too real apparently So midnight December 15th is whiteside gone or? Yeah whiteside is done IMO. It clearly isn't working Stotts has earned the right to ride the waves ?Casual 10 inches in Denver tonight Find yourself on the map! I'm more of a Frisco Can't believe I picked him up on the waiver wire week 2 in one of my leagues ?My dumbass friend cut him for Big Ben week 1 lol https://www.instagram.com/p/B5TSF4EFOLV/?igshid=18lxvvvmwcunc Team mom If he plays next season too he could move into the top 10 ever Embiid with a goose egg in 32 minutes? That's impressive I don't think so. He wasn't anywhere to be found tonight Gundy your lebron take is looking better and better by the day. 14 assists tonight The AD trade also seems like a win win all the way around. Don't see that often https://twitter.com/aaron_torres/status/1199185665675513856?s=21 Wait did dubov miss who led the team in scoring tonight??? The man he's been advocating for since day 1 We're all pitching in to get dubov a Melo Jersey for Christmas https://twitter.com/ayoarati/status/1199169475007762434?s=12 Denver defense is underrated There's also gonna be nobody at the game tonight. I can't even open my front door ?? ?Lexington Steele ain't got shit on this! Idk it makes my brain hurt Good way to lose even more fans Sounds dumb to me. I'm with hoomie for once Just re-do playoff seeding so it's 1-16 and start there Also, this will never ever change, but 7 game series are a big issue IMO. That's why the parity is so bad 5 game series would allow for more upsets / teams getting hot In the middle of the season? And it thought it was just for money? Doesn't fix it I wanna see a team like the Heat that gets hot towards the end of the year and runs thru the playoffs to upset the favorites Like the NFL Can't happen with 7 game series Nobody is gonna hang a "mid season tourney champs" banner in their arena That's another good point. Over half the league shouldn't make the playoffs 12 teams is better Nice call mark ? The pelicans got so lucky in that trade. And landing Zion. That shit never happens https://twitter.com/sarahmbingham/status/1199434822826938368?s=21 Lol I thought that was a parody account when I saw it No fucking clue why he posted that ? Jesus. That's terrifying https://www.instagram.com/p/B5YU5OvAIDe/?igshid=soiboknnjtek Is he gonna get to 40k before it's all over?? I think he could do it. After this season he'd only need 6,000 more. 4 seasons of 1500 points each? That's 23 points per game at 65 games per season Solo movies are lit ?You guys wanna see what a desperate sales rep looks like at the end of the month I'm gonna text this guy every morning til he responds I'm gonna send him fucking good night texts We've reached desperation level 2 This is where my boss emails his boss We call this "break glass and cross your fingers" Dubov why are you in Texas again? Is that where your girl is from? Haha oh boy that's gonna be entertaining https://www.instagram.com/p/B5YooTZFGBq/?igshid=1wmptu6f0zffg This is hilarious. Nobody wore big baller brand, but people are gonna buy branded gear for the brother not even in the league? Lol Bleacher report got the best editors in the game 10 gawd turned out to be 10 fraud, and Melo ballin out. Tough time to be dubov ?Making my first turkey. Wish me luck Just made some baked brie. Pairs nicely with a corona light ?Andy cucked me Matt ?Best part. While Andy was ignoring me, my boss emailed their president. Andy's boss proceeded to throw him under the bus. Don't fuck me with Andy I'll expose you Dubov how have the conservative dinner table conversations been? Lol space that was a great summer Me you cam and the poker champ himself Hahaha holy shit I forgot about all those stories Remember 4th of July when kenjon barner was shooting Roman candles outside our house and someone pulled the stop sign outta the ground Littles convenience store didn't ID. Andre champagne for days Hahahaha holy shit that's an amazing memory. Those lache stories are great Also the tv story, I went with him to pick it up. It was one of those old 55 inch TVs with the fucking box attached to the back. He had a 2 door mustang. It wouldn't even get close to fitting in the door I was like how did you think this was even remotely possible? ?One of these lol Just a normal day in the sauce Melo looking beastly per usual Does Dubov know he's averaging 17 a game??? Yeah 9 points from the bench is less than ideal They ain't doing it with blocks! https://www.instagram.com/p/B5h_EEdg1q8/?igshid=1831lwezsq9nz Even our ex players are getting injured God Justin Tucker is so sick Steelers Good call big dawg Some kid from Beaverton broke the ncaa record in assists tonight And had zero points lol ? I just dropped the "per my previous email" line on a co worker who was being a dick and it never felt so good lol Wtf Why would he do that https://twitter.com/chrisbhaynes/status/1201592315271360513?s=21 Suck on that Dubov!! Chris Petersen taking an advisory role with the school I don't think that's an indictment of Lillard necessarily Towns is a beast Wow that's high for booker Idk who all is in their top 10. But Siakam, Luka, Beal and Kyrie for sure. maybe Mitchell and Simmons too Ah gotcha. Yeah 11-20 is pretty interchangeable. I would say Booker is for sure top 25. 15-20 I could see an argument https://twitter.com/andrewdbailey/status/1201678325892009984?s=21 Omg lol what a fuckin weirdo Holy shit it's black chad https://twitter.com/politico/status/1201925297752485891?s=21 She's also been polling in the wrong direction for weeks tho She was in the low 20's at one point I don't think anyone disputed that mark Mark remember when I thought riverboat Ron was racist lol I honestly thought that was true. I was like damn that's low key kinda fucked up I can't update my team everyday. Too much work On the mobile app? Wow I didn't see that til just now Incredible I'm so much more engaged now He's only got so many miles left. Gotta conserve energy Already came in my pants just looking at these jerseys We're so iso heavy this year The Stotts flow has vanished For sure but that's been a trend all year We're top 10 in ISO's and like bottom 5 in assists I don't understand how so many athletes fail to follow thru on those types of promises. Like it's not a huge deal but if you're not gonna do it, don't make the promise. Just makes you look like a douche There's a josh Hart one where he bought a N64 from a fan his rookie year and promised tickets to any laker game as part of the payment. Then he blocked the guy Yeah but he promised the guy the tickets. So he saw that DM and made the promise lol Like have your manager take care of the logistics Yeah true. Idk Just makes the player look dumb in the end. Real easy PR win to follow thru on that I think you could Matt Wear it to bungalow Saturday morning https://twitter.com/ShamsCharania/status/1203011599726006274 Gunz that's your boy Agreed. Beilein is a boss Watch it be like Jordan clarkson who's complaining the most or something lol Someone trash Is there a player with a bigger delta between their opinion of themself and reality than Jordan clarkson? Who's mr irrational confidence these days Dubov he has changed! He only jab steps 3 times before a shot instead of 4 I'm taking Melo over Love right now anyway. Sorry Cleveland I haven't watched Love play at all this year, but his stats say washed For real? Can't believe they've never mentioned that til now Jesus if he gets ejected for this How else is he supposed to tackle him Yeah but you hit him and stop him short by a hard Yard* https://www.instagram.com/p/B5wMO9xAuPr/?igshid=jld2plwk1soh Lebron to Portland confirmed! Love to Boston

Bazemore Little and picks to Cleveland 

Who says no Wtf was that Yes space I'll own up to that. He's proving me wrong Jesus Christ Non contact Soooo 3/5ths of our starting lineup is now done for the year. Sick Fuck ?Never in doubt, right Dubov? https://twitter.com/shamscharania/status/1203174002484756481?s=21 Welp So no cap room and No playoffs. Dope When's Lance Stephenson's Chinese contract up? Mark I wish I was hammered at a bar with you right now and instead of yelling out shitty bowl games, we'd be yelling out 40 year old small forwards Portland can sign And people would hate us Here comes Mike Miller! What's rip Hamilton up to these days! Starting at forward, Bruce Bowen! I'm dying ?????? Hedo Turkoglu finally makes up for past sins! Signs with Portland! Did you hear Michael Finley has been getting in black ops runs?! He's still got the corner 3! Now that you bring it up, if Georgia gets absolutely pounded by LSU, Baylor beats Oklahoma in a sloppy game, maybe we get in over a 1 loss Baylor? gundy I respect you going with the politically correct "governor" title in your tweet Sign him up! Maybe Jcrossover?? Round 2 Lol did you watch the video? C Webb said his girl probably left him after that ?? The Dr Pepper challenge chest pass is what's wrong with America today I think Dubov shared it last night but the aviation gin peloton rebuttal didn't get enough liga love That was brilliant https://twitter.com/vancityreynolds/status/1203118775815622664?s=12 Can one of the ad guys enlighten me tho. I learned in mktg 410 that by law you can't actually drink in alcohol ads. That's why it's always just people about to cheers or something So how did she just chug her whole drink? Does Reynolds just not give a fuck about the laws Baylor win and LSU ass whooping of Georgia and mayyyyyybe we have a chance! Ahhh that makes sense tho Space please chime in and confirm! Doesn't 1 loss Clemson still get in over 2 loss Oregon tho Defending champs Agreed Brock https://twitter.com/dannykanell/status/1203385025561018368?s=21 There we go Denver Rengel * Sauce town to Orlando that's quite the move I imagine similar amounts of rock n revival jeans are worn in both cities tho If Georgia loses a close one to LSU I still prefer them over either of these trash teams Prob Wouldn't happen tho Weak ending Fuck I didn't realize this fight was in the middle of the day Matt I'm gonna use that at the pre game tonight "But what do I know right" Oklahoma gonna get the 4 spot ?My buddy bought 3 heat lamps for his party and my mind is blown. They sell them for $99 at Home Depot I thought they were like 900 Should I shoulder tap for coke at this house party is the question Da fuck Holy fuck Juice Wrld died He was the fucking man Losing in my fantasy playoff game cuz Kamara only scored 5 points while the saints put up 46. That's just cruel Pretty wild that the Titans insert Tannehill and start averaging 40 points a game, Win 6 of 7 and have a chance at a division title I guess Mariota was the problem all along Lakers on the 28th who's game My buddy lost 500 on the cp3 shirt untucked drama.

Pays out +525 Rockets and nuggets are locks You leaning clippers dubov? That's gonna be a good ass game Lakers got the better duo but clippers got the better supporting cast Trez and Lou will off the bench is such a luxury I'm kinda out on Kuz Houman Hawaii BYU bowl game.

It was too good to pass up What's the liga consensus, are we going lakers or clippers ML tomorrow? Need to lock in my 5 teamer tonight What about that phantom field goal from BYU that looked like a make and they called it no good https://twitter.com/bobmenery/status/1209691596360425472?s=21 Gundy you gotta warn us before posting that much heat!! Just came my pants May god be with all the men that are being gifted team Jordan's from their girl right now ???? Is that an #ad in the liga I did all favorites. Clippers lakers is a coin toss so I had to go with the best player on the court Sharps are heavy lakers too fwiw Sometimes I get so stressed I just don't watch the games I'm betting on. Then I realized that kinda defeats the purpose of betting https://twitter.com/adam_mares/status/1209875415466045440?s=21 Accurate I love that 37.5 points is a toss up. Harden is unreal Only 1/10th of the way through this parlay. Gonna be a long day lol ?You guys see this 15 teamer last weekend? 5 bucks netted $100k Gundy is gonna cash one of those one day and we're all going to Ibiza on him I loved Rovell getting ripped by gamblers yesterday He posted about how Hawaii has this unreal home field advantage. And people were like yo they're 20-20 in their last 40 home games and have a top 5 worst ATS record in the last 3 seasons lol Gundy how realistic is a 3 way trade that sends Love to Boston and Hayward to Portland Hayward's looking nice Brock! We need some wing scoring. Plus expiring contract Can sign him for cheaper next season Dame, CJ, Hayward, Collins, Nurk. With Baze, Hood, Simons and Little off the bench ?? Is that a fast one? They need big man help Whiteside lol Cleveland just wants cap relief and a pick Or at least that's all they can get. Idk how that complicates adding Boston tho. Prob gotta give them something too Throw in all the picks tho. Dames prime is now Alright boys 1 down, 4 to go Fair My whole life is pipe dreams Parlay is fucked. Packing it in now Okay this is actually bad Giannis is a fraud Let's double down take Bucks ML live This is the start of Giannis' exit from Milwaukee Small market loses again ?This x100 Lol Houman you funny bro Omg hahaha Cam that is gold Can we take a liga field trip to giphy HQ so we can all get personalized gifs Wtf are the rockets doing I'm disgusted Nothing but fraud MVP's today Bodes well for Dubov's clippers pick tho I love the grill master battle we have going here We're gonna have to settle this at the pit Mark is that an #ad too? Lot of promos flowing thru the liga today Who's gettin paid We should sell sponsorship That replay was so dumb That's off Beverly ten times outta ten in live speed If we break every single play down frame by frame you could change every call Of course bron touched it but that's not the point In a pickup game that's off Bev every time. Same with every other basketball game reffed in the last 50 years before replay Yeah this is a perfect example of replay going too far https://twitter.com/royceyoung/status/1210042499772952576?s=21 It's just stupid lol that's not basketball I'm against this lol Use it for goaltends and whether someone's foot was out of bounds or on the 3 point line It happened in the national championship game last year too. Guy pick pocketed Ty Jerome in the back court out of bounds. Should have been out on the Defense. Replay shows ball barely grazed Jeromes thumb before going out in the direction of the swipe lol it's just stupid I mean I'm not saying to review it and purposely get it wrong Lol I'm just saying you can watch that play and call it without dissecting it with a knife There's no reason a play like that needs review https://twitter.com/fastbreakbreak/status/1210044777581948930?s=21 Lol Bev clearly caused it to go outta bounds I'm not saying LeBron didn't touch it last I'm saying that call can easily be made in real time using common sense. Out on the defender. No need to replay I digress Heat blazers finals Lmao I was so confident in my parlay last night and I lost 4 out of 5 games That's impressive https://twitter.com/joeymulinaro/status/1209890301889929216?s=21 I'm going to see it tonight. Can't wait I love all the Christmas present videos on IG and then seeing the comments rip the kids for being bandwagon fans. Aka the kid wearing a Mahomes jersey and opening a PG Clippers jersey Makes my heart warm lol it's the modern fan now. They only like players not teams Oh shit happy birthday space! My favorite birthday night indeed We need to relive that night I'll summarize my memories of the night. It was me, space, Rengel, dubov, gundy, Dylan and Dehaan I think?

- we went to a rap battle at some dive bar
- we went to a martini bar and Dylan talked politics with this guy that thought he was gonna fuck him
- went to Mary's strip club and saw a stripper that looked like Katie kresl 
- Brock shattered his iPhone
- Rengel got mugged at an ATM and emptied out his bank account
- Rengel wanted to buy weed to make himself feel better and bought balled up newspaper
- all of us slept in one hotel room and Dylan and I cleaned out the mini bar (sorry space)
- Rengel pissed his pants (sorry Rengel)

Great night! Oh yeah and Rengel smoked crack! Haha holy shit I forgot about that ?@mark It's a cold world Both? I'm hitting the late late uncut gems Gonna need a 5 hour energy so I don't fall asleep in the theatre I'm loving this hype. T minus 1 hour ?I'm pre gaming uncut gems at BWW Omg I'm gonna explode Blue balls Wasn't a foul on Gobert tho That ending was fucking nuts Was that ass real? I just kept thinking about her sitting on my face the entire movie So many uncut gems references I wanna make. When does the lockout end? I say you get two weeks to see it before we start dropping spoilers Or else me dubov space clay and mark are gonna start a new group chat Incredible thread Mark Was that Calabro on the Rose over Dragic call? https://www.instagram.com/p/B6ns9rtjaD_/?igshid=8ntn0aipk1u2 Lol so dope. Denzel's greatest line Lol why wouldn't that dude just get the first down there. Who cares if you run out of bounds Jesus Christ I actually agree with clay Travis here So nobody responded to marks invite but me and him will be at spirit of 77 tonight watching blazers lakers. Then getting loose afterward. If any liga members wanna grace us with their presence I'd be honored Oh shit I missed it dubov my bad! Yes now we can talk uncut gems! You're not invited if you haven't seen the movie yet Rengel last time I saw you weren't we sharing that little crack den motel in Eugene? Good times Agreed. Cum all En route Omg ?Never in doubt Wow Terrible clock management Pete That and the wasted timeout on a near delay of game 2 plays earlier https://twitter.com/darrenrovell/status/1211775650694082560?s=21 This would be so lit Robert smith is a baller I'm right with you mark https://twitter.com/kevndu/status/1211752861987553280?s=21 ? Marc Gasol? Lol Apparently I took Texas ML when I was blacked out on Saturday lol Bold play Lol likely. I'm an impressionable guy after 5 beers ?Just saw these dudes come out of the Gucci store at the mall wearing team Jordan's lol Texas ML Mark!! Ooooooh baby!! Let's fucking go I gave you the call hours before the game Mark. All this tells me is you trust murph's gambling picks more than mine ??????? My favorite Kenny Rowe memory. We all know Cam Juarez used to take home some dragons back in the day right. So one night freshmen year he's making out with this chick against the wall at a party and I'm like "got damn, I'm hammered but that chick looks like a linebacker!". Then I look over to my right and directly next to Cam is none other than Kenny Rowe - an actual linebacker! So I could drunkenly compared the two (Kenny and the chick) and I'm like "yep! That chick is massive! Same size" Brock that is gold Ducks baby https://www.instagram.com/p/B6wudOJFZ-F/?igshid=185bok0j89ur9 @me @gundy +215 Ian Damn just saw that. Fucking crazy Yeah what is this play calling. Horrible 4th down call Yikes my buddy took Oregon ML 1H. That hurts Rough one man Jesus Christ Herbert Let's fucking go ducks I somehow hit them live at +5.5 for +150 too. Never seen a spread payout that big ? Anyone else hit Georgia? I'm up in the air Do the Paul George. Bring him back for like 10 games limited minutes. Just to get the reps before next season. This season is a wash Agree with dubov and it's used in HOF resumes Like would russel Wilson be a HOFer without pro bowl votes? Who knows ?Would've been my best parlay yet. 25 to win 125 and auburn had to go fuck it up I still don't think I've won more than a 2 teamer If we didn't go 4-8 when helfrich got canned we'd be ahead of LSU and Wisconsin too ?I'm coaching another camp and this kid has the most swaggin name ever Mark he is indeed white I think I'm gonna put the house on Seahawks/Pats ML parlay tomorrow Thoughts? Wow mark you take that back I took hawks ML Eagles are trash Mark you just said Houston has 1 receiver to throw to and you're on the eagles? Who the hell is wentz throwing it to? Lol eagles already used that card 2 seasons ago They're riding the "our division is the worst in football" wave Zach Ertz can barely walk Seahawks broncos lions baby But nah I don't discriminate when it comes to money And I'm on hawks heavy tmw lol JJ watt is most definitely getting injured again lol he's a psycho https://twitter.com/shamscharania/status/1213609802976440322?s=21 Nothing like the ol prevent sack lol It was a 59 yarder Ball was on the 42 yeah? Same same Lol why wouldn't you kick that Seriously Brock. What a dumb call Like sure you leave them 90 seconds to go the length of the field a Td beats you but a FG drive starting at the 30 is way easier To tie This is insane This is the game that gets billy fired Lol booger really said get a few yards then spike it on a 3rd & 10 play. That'd be a turnover bro Lol wow Bill o Brien you is really dumb Always take the points!!! Totally Plus the Texans have a good D It's always so hard playing on your heels when a team only needs like 30 yards to get in FG range Playing D with 75 yards behind you and knowing the other team needs a TD to win is much safer This is unreal Buffalo is gonna pull this out They got all the momentum Brock! Fly route to the fullback ?? That was a former top 10 pick whiffing that tackle dubov lol This game is comical Reminds me of high school when we were playing Dehaan. 3rd and 28 and I gave up a 29 yard catch smh Haha no actually it was 29 yards in the air. Pretty deflating Omg Man that was some horrible football the last 20 minutes or so It's not too late to bet on the hawks mark Win that money back on a sure thing Mark I know. I'm saying it's not too late to make a smart bet for once And win your money back Dubov you beast God Derrick Henry is a man Brady really gonna let Ryan college wide receiver tannehill beat him?? Small balls Vrabel! Vrabel out thinking himself Bellicheck gonna pounce Wtf is going on Punter got some huge nuts on him Here we go Brady. Is he a HOFer? Idk but get this cover for me and he's in in my book Jesus Christ Edelman Omg You're kidding me Jesus that punter is a machine Why would you not have Edelman deep to fair catch that Wow. Brady with a jamies ending to his Pats career Vrabel is such a shit coach. Lucky win Please tell me you don't think Vrabel is a good coach lol He's just not a great coach overall imo. He was about to get fired this year before he benched mariota I mean he made multiple bone headed calls this year too I just think he's clearly a lower tier coach in the league Is Lockett out or something Kevin Hart? Meek Mill? Money May? ?I'm sending this game to overtime Saints fans are gonna burn down razzuu tonight mark Haha amazing 3 man rush sack lol ya hate to see it He ran right into that sack lol Deja vu with the illegal shift 10 sec run off This game was destined for OT as soon as I picked up the buffalo Did we ever figure out the eagles line swing? Was it just a huge bet? Wowowow Kirk cousins is definitely elite Holy shit Rudolph just dunked on him! Mark I told my gf how you love being the bank and just taking any action people in the group chat offer. She just goes "who do you want to win this game?" I'm like Seahawks. She goes "okay I get the Seahawks you be mark. 20 bucks" lmao So now I'm on the eagles baby! Hahahahaha Wow Brock that was good Touch Well I already lost 200 bucks on pats hawks parlay so why not mix it up So here we are Seahawks man. Told you Mark I told you Mark you fade me on Texas. You fade me on Seattle. But murph's picks are gold plated smh I was forced. my $200 parlay says it all I told you hawks would win God dammit Milwaukee I love how Washington had both Mcvay and Shanahan inside the organization and didn't promote either I agree id rather take a shot on an up and comer than some retread Packers are the biggest frauds in the league clay They're losing this weekend Whoa whoa Russ is a man of god lol Packers are trash tho man Lost to the eagles and niners who Seattle has already beat How is Gettlemen still in charge ?These type of headlines are indeed the worst, but this is such a JJ Watt tweet it hurts lol I love me a deal Dubov And free is the best kind of deal Also Dubov great segue from Dash player to DASH pass ?Hey JJ ?I pulled a gundy tonight I'm currently betting ATP tennis Just hammering people I've never heard of Our team is so depressing Fire Olshey! Dylan back me up Hahaha so true Should we actually keep whiteside next year? Just play him and nurk 24 min each Yeah I feel like that wouldn't be a bad setup. Idk who's really jumping to give him a starring role tho Lol good call Same Did you trail parlay patz again? Meloooooooo Let's go Hahaha Jesus You're the worst Houman That was incredible Melo the ?? CJ was so fucked if he kept the ball. RHJ had him completely frozen Fucking Cavs shit the bed in the 4th and ruined my parlay They're saying that plane might have been shot down by an Iranian missile now Has anyone not seen it? Is the lockout period over? Dylan spoil it for everyone Houman these are the hot takes I come to the group chat for Don't forget, trump also benefits from media attention moving away from impeachment ?? And now he can use this as a way to call Democrat's unpatriotic. Did you see how many republicans ran to Fox News to call dems terrorist sympathizers Houman you got me fired up! Ledlow's next message for us is gonna be "I hear you guys are the most knowledgeable foreign policy chat around, and Chad tells me Houman discovered the Trump Iran quid pro quo" ?International crisis = business opportunity Always be closing Finally. Midnight tonight the lockout ends All spoilers will be dropped Expose him! You could record tv in 2007? Damn. Who knew I grew up in the country man. I didn't get more than 5 tv channels til like 2008 Our antenna randomly worked better when it rained, so during the summer when we were watching TV, me and my brother would run outside during commercial breaks and hose down the antenna to get better reception True story Fucking Colby and his little man syndrome uncle Long story short Colby's uncle was one of my high school football coaches. They made us bleach our practice pants every weekend and checked for cleanliness on mondays. I couldn't bleach mine cuz I lived in the country and have well water (you can't use bleach in hard water). So they check our pants and mine were stained from mud but still clean. I told him I had well water and he lost his shit. Thought I was telling some tall tale and made me bear crawl all practice Lmao fucking dickie v Good lord I thought Steve Harvey was the guy on the Blazers when we lost to LA in game 7 ? Lol did you actually talk to him? The tip is my favorite part I actually saw a stat that Andre Drummond wins the most tips in the league. It's over 60% That ass is mesmerizing Julia's. Not Drummond Ian my buddy seems to have a lot of faith in Miami tonight ? Ballsy play So you're saying I shouldn't trail him? Lol I went 1-4 last night. On top of my Pats loss my account is dwindling Gundy got the itch again! Did anyone know you can cash out live on ML bets? Yeah he started with $100 yesterday. Won like 3 tennis bets and a CBB bet. Then turned his heat pick into 2 grand Unreal ?He just cashed it. 2 grand richer ?First the in the league in FT % gundy! That's basically 50/40/90! Lol said Portland was going to the finals in this chat? Without nurkic Nobody And even if that was true, the Jamal Murray prediction is worse lol Trade whiteside for Love asap Then trade Bazemore for Harrison Barnes. We're in business baby Absolutely gundy Except I keep thinking about the Marc Spears interview when he said trading CJ is the one thing that could drive Dame outta town Is Dame that tied to him? They'd probably split ball handling duties. But dame plays great off the ball At that point it's more of "get the 5 best players you can on the court at the same time" And Simmons can guard the 4 Dame, Simons, Ben, Love, Nurkic ?? I'm sure Sideline olshey is on it!! Ian I see you laughing at our trade proposals Enlighten us Who's Ben fetching Dragic and Winslow? Fair I don't think they trade anyone either Damn Get him away from the Pac Party and live off the radar? ESPN hired Omar Raja?? Does that mean he sold HoH to bleacher report entirely? https://awfulannouncing.com/espn/omar-raja-officially-joins-espn-steering-network-social-content.html That's wild. Good for him. Says he got a multi million dollar deal from ESPN I wonder what he sold HoH for What would it take to snag him? Ghost of Caleb swanigan? Whaaaaaaaaa https://twitter.com/shamscharania/status/1215397035362398214?s=21 Dubov do you prefer cash or bitcoin? https://www.instagram.com/p/B7Hb15KHm8y/?igshid=nf68jyemnnfy Sportscenter account bout to be lit My buddy that bet the Heat last night says put the house on Blazers ML tonight lol Towns and Whiteside both being GTD is too risky for me He'll get it ?If anybody wants to stress themselves out for 3 days and trail me I'm throwing $200 to win $1350 Is Wiggins playing? What in gods name is Portland doing haha We're getting a top 5 pick at this rate I agree Dylan Honestly what's dope too is we could finish with like the 10th worst record and get the 3rd pick. With the new flat lottery odds But we should most def tank Trade for Love Rest everyone Wait for next year Trade bazemore too. He's an abomination Yeah whiteside and a first or something Cleveland just wants cap relief at this point Those are automatic Brock I'm trying to do something big. I'll do it with ya Mark great movie reference You know I love me some Dennis quaid Jimmy is so weird Sometimes he scores like 14 and they dominate Seahawks ML. Get rich kids Packers biggest fraud 13 win team since Dak Is Tannehil elite? Too bad Mariota wasn't leading this surge ?? Wonder where he plays next year Wow There goes my parlay Thought that was a lock Smh I need Nurk fever to save me 5x5's and 20/20 games galore I can't believe my parlay didn't fall https://twitter.com/slamonline/status/1216415028884180992?s=21 Weird they left Zach Collins and Caleb Swanigan off the graphic Love a good drunk bet My last drunk bet was Texas ml Keep it rolling Rovell drafting up his tweet already "a $100 parlay on 49ers, Titans, Texans and Seahawks would have won you $6,287 ??" This is nuts Life comes at you fast https://twitter.com/getnickwright/status/1216449981802012673?s=21 This went from freezing cold take ratio status to genius in like 20 minutes Guys even better time to hit seahawks money line Lol clay the bitter man Goff being a fraud was a lot to handle I know Brock the rams are gonna reload in the draft! Todd Brandon Roy gurley and 6th round draft picks to the super bowl Some things never change Rengel Mark that's a funny way to spell Jared Goff Seahawks ML For the 6th time Wait for it Overturn it That's absurd Total blown call Packers are frauds Terrible call Excited to see the rams 5th round pick this year tho clay Y'all are gonna have a great 8-8 2020 That was 2 yards of ass He was clearly a whole yard short ? I'm not mathematician but that was horeseshit Yeah cmon the ball was at his stomach chest area You think the ball is at the top of his face mask Dubov? Lol He holding it with his teeth? For sure. That was totally a call where without anything previously affecting our judgement, you would look at objectively and say it's short But with the whole conclusive shit it completely fucks up the decision making Oh idk if we can say without a reasonable doubt All I know is beyond a reasonable doubt Jared Goff was sitting at home tonight Lol seattle is the pnw team mr LA But yes broncos are my number 2 Are you a magic fan too? I have St Louis as a territory now. Going there in February. So stoked ? If Tannehill wins 2 Super Bowls with 55k yards passing and 350+ td's he's for sure a HOFer Lol damn ?I give you the Trump edited version Did anybody see AB's newest meltdown and the Bentley quote lol "The Bentley stays, the broke hoes go" That's iconic lol ? Stephen A is so dumb sometimes lol Lol what's funny is Phoenix is actually on the right track now. Booker and Ayton is a good core But you wonder where twitter fans get these ridiculous trade proposals and then you see a guy making $10 mil a year to talk basketball doing the same thing lol Wow that's wild CTE ain't worth it Already Made $63 mil not including endorsement https://twitter.com/spotrac/status/1217458998212997120?s=21 Did you guys know our namesake works at pacific office automation in Eugene? Lol ? Yeah I won't be able to make it either unfortunately Can someone screenshot it for the plebeians Wow Steak for the hawks Steal Money grab ?Caruso 4th now lol What's the market for DLo? I wonder what Minnesota is proposing To GS? No way that is happening lol Idk what KAT would return but its way more than DLo. He's a beast Damn if they included the #1 pick I guess that's a conversation. That would suck for the rest of the league once Curry comes back lol Is there a prospect in the draft that compares to KAT tho is the question Flat lottery odds baby. It's possible Who wants to come to Colorado sep 26th Gunz are BI and Mitchell all stars this year? God if LaMarcus makes it lol. Dude has snuck onto so many all star teams No Westbrook? Yeah I would not be mad at Westbrook missing Damn no love for Dame Probably indirectly. I imagine it's a part of Basketball Related Income which is negotiated in the CBA. I think players owners split it 50/50 All I know is Meyers doesn't have to worry about collecting any of that ?Damn I didn't realize Draymond was having such a killer season. Can't believe you left him off the west all star roster gunz https://www.instagram.com/p/B7clrLuAE9w/?igshid=gll1jnzb3iax I'm fully on the Ja hype train Grizzlies were so lucky to bail on Conley and get a way better replacement at the perfect time. They got a nice young squad Everything 90's gives me a boner lol Timberwolves pin stripe jerseys, hawks throwbacks, jazz, magic pinstripes, raptors throwback Those cream ones are v sexy So are the red rip city kits we rocked against Houston The white piping is cum worthy Wrong player Shoulda got Barnes Dumb trade Short sighted I'm sure Dame is hyped! Wait what Russ isn't playing? Wow I'm drunk Fuck Russ ?Guys I'm watching Vail v. Breckenridge semi pro (pay to play) hockey right now in a 250 seat arena. Not sure how I ended up here lol But go Yeti's This is like an SF twilight zone. Every dude either works in construction or is a ski instructor and lives in a $2 million house ?It's getting rowdy af in here ?Look at this sign I found My friend said they had a free place to stay in Vail, so I packed up the car and came for a ski weekend haha and apparently this is what the locals do on Saturday night Wowowow Mark that's incredible What was the deposit God dammit that's beautiful One wins, we all win I got $100 up to $650 then lost it all lol So I tip my cap to you Wow It snows in Vail too in case you guys were wondering Hahaha Ian I was on the edge of my seat Gundy that's a depressing scenario Jody fuckin sucks Don't get cheap around the edges during dames prime Brock that's not the point. Bazemore was indeed trash. But we could have used his expiring deal to trade for an upgrade to the roster. Or use in a huge trade with whiteside. Instead we cut costs Completely wasted an asset (his contract) not him Packers are frauds https://twitter.com/chrisbhaynes/status/1219304256072585216?s=21 I hope he's okay. But the line about him being in peak physical condition was kind of ironic I also had the weirdest dream last night and you all were in it. I get back from being out of town, and my entire house was robbed. My neighbor ended up being the mastermind behind it all. But I invited the entire JCSL over for a football watch party, and we all show up at the same time. My house is completely looted. Dubov goes "where's the TV?" And I'm like "I got robbed!" And he goes "I know but like, how are we supposed to watch the game?". I'm like "dude idk I got Fucking robbed!". So someone else says "alright dude we'll we're gonna go to a bar and watch the game but lemme know if you need anything" and everyone left lol it was a trip What's the scoop https://www.instagram.com/p/B7kAxd5AFnq/?igshid=1oaorw2yi1pl8 Tebow finally losing that v card
