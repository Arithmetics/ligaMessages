Time for him to come home Big shout out to Chris Peterson With that punt This is ridiculous Nurkics line 24 points, 23 rebounds, 7 assists, five blocks and five steals Never been done before in nba history Nobody has ever had a 5x5 with 20+ points and rebounds Hakeem is the closest ever and he had only 4 steals Wow you guys RIP to a legend Funkhouser https://deadline.com/2019/01/bob-einstein-dead-curb-your-enthusiasm-super-dave-osborne-smothers-brothers-1202527938/ Legend from Curb Dion Waiters is active for the first time this season Heat Championship soon He did He also shouldnt have said that Its technically off the record You can still use off the record shit You just dont snitch on the dude who said it I am just hyped they got Bad Bunny and J Balvin Its what happens when you reach the top Bol Bol news is public ?? I think it just always happens when you get that many followers. If you stray from the brand people will get pissed lol Do you think New Orleans would prefer CJ, Collins, Simons and a first for AD over the Lakers package? Damn maybe Kawhi is human He looks SHOOK Woulda been a legend in the 80s/90s Throw in Chandler Parsons too lmao God the raptors just cant not choke Bol is a unicorn! Easily From the 4th quarter on it was so epic back and forth Hes fucking crazy man His range is deeper this year too That was justice too after that terrible missed call on KD This shot of the rockets bench is amazing https://twitter.com/bubbaprog/status/1081071223184998400?s=21 Damn I hate CP but thats a great tweet Great use of a guaranteed contract! Way to go neil! Its pretty clear Terry doesnt like Wade He played fucking Simons over him I will get back to you, would prefer a spot with wi-fi. I like Pour Sports for NBA personally Alright Im in for Pour Sports at 7:30 They also have a CBD juice I like which is dope cause Im doing dry Jan Yes!

Hes on a potential championship contender and hes still bitching Except he thinks hes fucking LeBron Dude lets swing for the fucking fence! Anthony Davis! All the best ones CJ, Collins, Simons If Boston isnt gonna put Tatum on the table do they really have a better package? Theyre not gonna trade brown and Hayward dude Its Danny ainge He got Kyrie for fucking spare change Portlands best package is better than the Lakers best, I know that much I suppose, but they cant do that until the summer anyway. They wont trade AD but if I want an established borderline star and some high potential assets, Portland package is right there Non Blazers folks were even saying the package isnt that bad New Orleans could make a run at Zion if they move AD before the deadline But mostly, Neil is a pussy and would never do it Reportedly, he doesnt care about the extra money So technically yes? I believe so??? Would it kill him to drive to the basket like, once? Whole defense is in a scramble and he pulls up for that Someone is gonna make a helluva movie about this Lmaoo https://www.instagram.com/p/BsNTgwVFIVZ/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=1349hwhh5u5ow The caption says its satire but its so great lmao Kawhi would be so much cooler if he actually said that Too much media training ??????

Its second of a back to back but theyre a young team Shouldnt be an issue Hes from Louisiana right? I guess Florida is more like that than Arizona Ahhhhh For some reason I thought he was southern I just put 10 down on the Knicks which for me is basically a rack in bovada dollars The Knicks with the points is the official team of the Superliga Knicks +6.5 at lakers started this wave God the warriors are such bitches https://twitter.com/markg_medina/status/1082785888856231936?s=21 Yes, basically theyre trying to find out if the entire scenario was planned out before hand. And if it was, the Cavs might lose their first round pick when they have the worst record in the league All because GSW is snitching Yeah I mean obviously fuck DG but GSW being such a bitch about Pat fucking McCaw is so ridiculous ?

I would put Dame over Klay I also dont think Adams makes it. I think LaMarcus or derozan go over him Lol okay so thats a no Elie Okobo from Phoenix? Hes French Man international is harder than I thought Oh dude Kurcus For the Nets Thats not how its spelled but he plays and is decent This guy ? He did but apparently they do it by ranks and not margin of votes Harden will at least tie him There is a chance he will make it but if hes not a starter its not happening Steph, Harden, LeBron, PG and KD Yeah AD works too I could flip a coin between those guys Probably, nobody likes kd Harris is a good one But man As a fan I cant put him in over Luka Clippers record be damned Dubovs We forgot one of our sons Cedi!!!

Really? Interesting Most people on Twitter hate it too But man, Conley and Dame??? You know Vivek really loves? STAUSKAS I like all those guys but Id rather be in the playoffs with Mike Conley than any of those dudes Conley is still elite, Gasol is the one has fallen off ?And Kyrie just posted this Okay rain check That is not Kyries IG Also Conley is way better than CJ Come on Dude is an elite playoff performer I just think Conley is a way better defender and a more elite offensive player Also he has experience Hes 31! Hes got at least two more years Before he hits the wall I say fucking go for it Functionally how different is it than CP3 and Harden? Conley is a great defender! Hes outplayed Chris Paul in the playoffs before And hes younger Also if you get temple and JaMychal you replace Evan turner with two 3/D guys Alright Its also kind of a Neil move Its unconventional which is the shit he fucking loves ?? Yeah Im just tired of seeing the blazers stand pat man Were like the raptors of getting to the 2nd round Instead of the conference finals Like, that deal to me is a clear upgrade, even if its marginal Like, youre upgrading your third best player and maybe making it your 2nd best thats not nothing Wasnt Veema kinda like Steel credit card Dude six years is a p great run for a punter On one team Even if he does get cut ?????? Pretty sure you cant but idk maybe New York is different Ian Im watching there was a lets go hear chant *heat Fuck dude that injury sucks Dude Im stoked to see D Wade In Portland Evan Turner is Li-Ning ??????

I love Kuz too but Theyre better off waiting and trying to sign Kris Middleton If they can get Ad now Kuz is really good! But you cant just get Anthony fucking Davis for some guys For whiteside and Tyler Johnson?? Man I really think they should trade him before the deadline Sure Boston can get involved later but how many teams will put everything on the table right now to get an extra half season with AD? And even if a team gets the No. 1 pick, they suck and it would be dumb to trade Zion I mean definitely but I dont think Simmons is on the table AD doesnt like being center Also Im in for the Miami/Blazers game So count me in for the ticket head count Yes Im fine with whatever Thats a pretty great deal Yes I agree you do it fuck it. Chris Haynes aka Klutch HQ already saying Davis doesnt wanna be in Boston Yeah at some point dames loyalty needs to be rewarded And no longer taken for granted 20 bucks with fees? https://twitter.com/threekola/status/1090017921726857217?s=21 Lol yeah right New Orleans is so butt hurt Filing a law suit against the nfl and now this lol If anything at all http://fw.to/kegEMEF Thats not a sketch link https://www.nbcsports.com/northwest/portland-trail-blazers/jake-dont-call-me-snake-layman-another-blazer-2nd-round-steal But JIC here is the story Neil Olshey goes on the record to talk about how great he is at finding value in the 2nd round the day Anthony Davis requests a trade. Like, I just cannot I was talking about it with my buddy Richman, all those steals have turned into 17 million in dead money for Andrew Nicholson lol Oh my god Im fucking dying at this https://twitter.com/killakow/status/1090051339948822528?s=21 No Wow Lonzo is more of a leader than Ingram too He was stepping up before the ankle injury, playing winning basketball and scoring more So fucked up We are gatekeepers I learned that from mark Yeah hes really great at knowing who is hot but not very good at schematic adjustments mid game Lmaooo okay cause coaching a LeBron team is very easy https://twitter.com/psocotchnbcs/status/1090349538785734656?s=21 Thanks Neil Wow Ian pulling us out of a blazers depression, 2019 is wild https://twitter.com/thehoopcentral/status/1090344066460540928?s=21 This means we havent even called Kyler is such a joke Sure! https://twitter.com/shamscharania/status/1090376655003156484?s=21 Jody Allen Yeah Dude he sucks Poor mans deaaron Fox Lol Fox last year wasnt that great but he wasnt as bad as Sexton either You guys Rudy Gay hit a game winner tonight https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WK7lIjFsGvg And thats what happens when you cut costs and lay-off journalists!

That only works if you count LaMarcus and dame getting in as an injury replacement Westbrook is the only one Im having trouble with but I think he gets it even tho his shooting his historically bad DeAaron Fox probably more deserving Could DeRozan be a wild card??? Luka Would be the most fun Porzingis!!! https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1091045059699576832?s=21 Do it Neil!

Epic! Dam Damn I bet 10 on them to win the title last night low key 14-1 Wow Im becoming a raptors fan The just added Jeremy Lin And then Wayne Ellington goes to Detroit Also sending Lin to potentially the heaviest Asian market is just classic And Marc Gasol comes off the bench Look at what happens when you go all in for a superstar God We would be the team signing Jeremy Lin For the playoff run We are probably not even gonna fill that last roster spot with a vet Will be some more classic Olshey g league bullshit Damn they gotta play the video Fuck you clay we need some climate change in this bitch I want to keep hunkering down I havent seen it yet but I probably will Wow Haynes already pouring a bucket of water on us Doesnt even mention Portland in his markieff story I do not want to see anymore crunchtime Harkless ever again Aminu, fine. Hood, fine. No more crunchtime Harkless. As a coach thats the attitude you have to have but objectively it def cost them lol The blazers deserved to lose but they still coulda won I But to ignore time, score and situation in that situation is...also ignorant Both things can be true. If youre the coach of the team thats how you have to approach it. But that doesnt change the observable reality of the consequences of that missed call. I agree the L2M is dumb The league should get rid of them, at least publicly I really want Lamar to shut up about the blazers player development lol Were down by 15 like come on lol Felton adding salt in the wound Making it profoundly worse Neither was Anthony Davis with more years left https://twitter.com/pdxbrocialite/status/1095165020256624641?s=21 The video honestly did make me feel better This TcU/Kansas game kinda lit What a nice score at the end of regulation Wow The nba referee twitter account was a mistaken *a mistake This is horse shit https://twitter.com/officialnbarefs/status/1095348185571172355?s=21 Did yall see that ridiculous Brad Beal travel?

Blocboy JB is also coming for his fortnite bag lol (His is the fortnite dance where the kids jump up and down) ?????? Lmao noooooo I support blaming Neil even tho it was before him lol Less than a month away from seeing Act and the whole crew At the rose land Bill Walker another hype legend Cant wait for rich Paul to be the gym GM But realistically I bet he buys the Cavs If the money was good enough He doesnt even live in Cleveland You think sarver would? Oooooh Do tell Hes too busy managing his 3 phones To follow teams on twitter lol Thats not a bad price It literally costs twice as much to sit center court in the 300 level tonight for blazers warriors Also nothing brings out the Asian community like the warriors Yeah dude those fan behaviors are just going to increase LeBrons fans are that way Yeah and I think most nba fans are fans of the whole league because they know so few teams can win it NBA fans are different from nfl fans in that way Yeah plus Instagram and Twitter, Reddit it doesnt matter Yeah and we are also lucky to live in a market that actually gives a shit about the nba Most places like Charlotte dont give a fuck Also Neil being a pussy precludes them from winning New Orleans has had the Pelicans/Hornets for longer than OKC has had the thunder tho Ive actually met magic fans in the wild Dwight Howard was once a top 2 player In the league The 09 Magic are the PED squad of a generation Yeah I think we all agree about that, but also saying younger generations care even less about it than we did Its happening baby KD to New York, iguodala returing Neil wants to kill me No I think its veteran minimum But this cuts Meyers out of the rotation I think weve seen the end of Harkless and Meyers playing a lot And probably Zach too We got hella Lebanese/halal But not Turkish I dont think No, Ive never even heard of a Turkish restaurant in PDX The Rip City Muslim Brotherhood has never been stronger Yeah we gotta get my man another number http://www.wweek.com/music/2019/02/13/check-out-the-lineup-for-end-of-the-rainbow-the-new-festival-replacing-sasquatch-at-the-gorge-amphitheater-this-summer/ You guys see this Sasquatch replacement?

Melo to Lakers baby Who else they gonna sign Everyone is off the market lol Im not gonna watch it but Im gonna take a little action on OKC -5 at Pelicans ? Oh man, its not looking good for the gay guy from Empire.

Its Danny ainge! What about danny ainges career would ever indicate hed give up on a star But never anybody good! Or someone who is great I bet the offer caps at Smart, Horford, Jaylen Brown and Rozier This is all a credit to Ainge Which is why I would never want to deal with him Also Chris Mannix, who basically works for the Celtics front office, reported that Ainge has never put Tatum explicitly on the table So the narrative is already in place for him to not be included Yeah and then the Lakers can be like hey No picks Or 1 pick And we keep Lonzo Theyll max Jimmy Mr. Butler doesnt have the luxury to pick anymore People already saying hes not getting a max Maybe like 2/48 If the Sixers want Meyers Leonard? Oh man the NFL was definitely colluding lmao https://twitter.com/mikefreemannfl/status/1096495453548564480?s=21 I dont think its real lmao Lol I dont believe it This is not looking good for ad I low key want dame to win it Over both The AF-1 Duckboot is the Portland version of Timbs No it was not The reports from that news station were irresponsible cause the police refuted it almost immediately Oh shit I didnt see that The police refuted it on Thursday Omg Wow Dame +800 Value bet of the night Its dames dream to ruin the Currys homecoming I got you Ill throw down 5 I got you Dubov It went to +750 Dylan I dont have enough left Amen Wow joe Harris legend Lets go Dame!!!!

The blazers lost but I profited on them once again We are a better basketball team than Houston. If Denver gets the 1 seed we could make the WCF If we want the 3 seed we gotta win these next two I definitely watched the last Ot, it was terrible but Im glad I saw some of it Hawks just too fatigued He shoulda come to Portland smh Holy shit https://twitter.com/adamschefter/status/1101938235041673216?s=21 Have you seen DK Metcalf??? ?

Congrats homie Colton is a little bitch Lebron looks like old thanos Already locked it in this morning We are on the Oregon trail, driving a COVERED wagon I also got lucky today, took Celtics +8 before they announced Klay is out and the line dropped 2 points God look at our blazers off to a great start Not as great but we can def get the cover up 2 at half CJ gotta carry us Killing it for my fantasy team They only do Thursdays until the playoffs and they also have to do march madness Ive never felt shame for that. Im a serial work shitter Yeah I would get mad about Boston getting called a contender but I also picked them to win before the season I wish Portland could get that respect but we gotta win a playoff game first We literally just washed Boston on their home floor They also didnt even have Embiid Yeah thats what I said. But Portland is better this year than last year. Its not the same team This road trip was possibly the best ball Ive seen them play since the year we beat Houston For starters, Dame doesnt have to carry the team on his back to get wins And nurkic is just better The scoring is more balanced And the wing rotation is better Harkless is finally healthy and Layman gives them another big wing Theyre gonna win more games this year than last year Also last year their offense was average and this year its elite Denver, Golden State and OKC I think Nurkic gives us a better shot against Houston and Ill take my chances with the refs in the playoffs against harden I think Jokic is too tough for nurkic We can bully them quite a bit tho It would be a tight series PJ tucker cant handle nurkic if they do that small ball shit You think Houston in 5? I dont think so Nurkic is a battering ram against slight centers He feasts on the Capelas and Jarrett Allens of the world At least he does now He didnt before Hassan is a better matchup tho Its weird Capela is a better player but worse against nurkic I definitely only did this cause I smoked weed immediately after work but I just put down Cavs +11.5 live at Brooklyn Dude it was my only loss on a 7 game road trip Come on It made my day Hes destroying the Lakers from the inside God the Lakers are getting dragged everyday this is amazing Every day on Twitter is shit on the Lakers day Blazers game tonight is a stay away for me -4 against OKC doesnt have me feeling very good Removed a heart from The fast and the curious Removed a heart from The fast and the curious Lmaooo I hope not Houston or UTAH You know what can Cam Youre right I just threw down 25 on blazers I teased it down to -3 I believe again Who cares Legendary The Muslim brotherhood protects Portland Kenny said we were a finals team last week Jokic is the only one who is better in the west I mo Im high on sports Aminu gets the blood diamonds Ive never seen him play a full game but I love the take because of how hot it is Rengel https://twitter.com/samstein/status/1105117871825391617?s=21 the racial tensions of Milwaukee could use our fresh eyes. We can solve racism as a Superliga! Tbh I might just put money on trump lol If he doesnt go down with this mueller shit hes gonna win ?Lets check in on Lakers fans God why is every nfl team other than New England so fucking dumb Literally ever offseason Wait that came from Alex Dubov? Fuck those shoes. OBJ Does the Superliga have any takes on Wofford -7.5? Nba games are uninspiring to me but that line is intriguing Lets do it I didnt throw down too much Your first reaction was right Too big a spread for a conference title game We might have a chance here Yes!!! Wofford!!! I need Wofford to come through, I pump faked a bet on my Cavs that would have paid You were right! Oh my god Wow did you get this off memes for Dubov dot com Dude gotta hear both sides Haha Im kidding about the fan I definitely believe he said some racist shit I mean look at his hat come on Oh it happened live on twitter tho Like as soon as the interview went on people were retweeting his shit and he locked his account Then why did he lock it? Thats right you guys are smarter than me at evaluating the veracity of stuff That video is fake But I do think his tweets are questionable and hes an ex cop He wouldnt say shit like that to a white player period Okay but the video being fake doesnt mean the OG tweet was fake either I think the one screenshotted was real but someone created that video to embellish dudes racism Theres also context that this happens to Westbrook more In every arena Yeah he was emasculating him Its also a trend that fans seem like they can say whatever they want at black players without retribution or punishment. And most of all in Utah. Nba players didnt just all get together to conspire to make everyone think Utah fans are racist JR Smith says hes never been called the N Word more than in Utah ? Racists barely use racist language in 2019 too Its all coded That is what Westbrook alleged last night That the wife also told him to get on his knees Yeah its like that white girl in Oakland yelling at LeBron and calling him a pussy ass bitch during the finals. Luckily for that fan LeBron isnt Westbrook. Oh my god I respect the NFL guys doing more ridiculous shit tho The baseball guys are doing it too now lol Like Bryce Harper tampering with mike trout and shit You guys see the hotel Larry Scott is staying in this week in Vegas? $7,500/night Gotta have comfort for that huge hog of his His GoFundMe is gonna be huge Wow LaMarcus told Quick he wants to be a Blazer again Wow Odell to Cleveland Please tell us Damn that is pretty insane But I guess if youre Cleveland what value do picks really have at this point? Yeah its def better than the AB deal for the Giants. How old is Odell? The giants did good Odell was wasted on that team And they got great value God the browns are gonna be sick How badly does this affect Odells Nike contract? He gets a pay cut for going to Cleveland right? I feel like unless youre Tommy you need a legit vertical threat to win tho, even if its not the way to win. Cleveland didnt have that. At least I dont think they did Kearse? So basically have Tommy lol Start the rebuild baby I dont understand the nfl salary cap https://twitter.com/jason_otc/status/1105620673907568643?s=21 I dont understand how you can trade someone and then have them still on your cap? Is that cause of guaranteed money? Damn that makes me like the deal a lot less for them but theyre gonna suck so who cares The Steelers got absolutely fucked lmao https://twitter.com/glennmoorecle/status/1105627993467166721?s=21 Are the Browns gonna get earl thomas??? NFL free agency is super lit https://twitter.com/asilversteintv/status/1105636927724646400?s=21 This guy has a blue check but has no Cleveland ties Are we all in on DK metcalf tho??? Nothing is in my phone Omg Ian is that the guy you bought from at Pitchfork??? Classic Pretty good Coke Non-Florida divisin Idk how D2 did it but he supplied the best coke Ive ever had lmao Removed an exclamation from Probably a great go route runner His speed is crazy for his size But his side to side shit wasnt so great Thats worth a first round pick IMO But maybe I overvalue receivers I dont know who he is so no Lol I will say his stats sucked but he was on the team with two other nfl receivers Dallas gotta rest Luka and put the tank into high gear I think he means taking will fuller Thankful I dont have to listen to the mixtape ?Oliver Maroney with a rich father (Howard Schultz of Starbucks) Smh but good fucking win! When we get Anthony Davis for CJ>>>> I still believe we can outbid the Lakers And LaMarcus coming home to play alongside AD? Wow 2021 as a free agent but we could trade for him All the 2016 guys are expiring This summer And if they like Collins Or Simons And a pick or two If you dont have to give up CJ the deal is a win for Portland Is that not possible??? He clearly hates his job now Dude chad this has always been my blazers pipe dream We get the right cast around Dame when hes just unquestionably the best guard in the west For 1 year Chauncey billups type shit When Steph and Harden have a slight decline and Dame is in that sweet spot is what we need LaMarcus baby Lol Dude what if LaMarcus does some Anthony Davis shit And is just like no Im not playing and I want out Whats the market for LaMarcus on the trade market Realistically Who has the incentive to trade for him? Other than US Collins, Simons and two firsts Boom And salary filler Probably not so who else? We have 50 million in expirings Or at least close to it Blake could be available I wouldnt include CJ for love If the Cavs want a first and cap relief tho Cavs fans are drooling over that scenario Like thats the goal for Cavs fans is trade love for CJ Depends how much and how long https://twitter.com/adamschefter/status/1105864566473396225?s=21 Holy shit thats fucking wild The official shoe of the Superliga My IG appears to be working For now Is Latavius Murray good? What a dumb move by them Peyton Manning honestly the commercial GOAT I cant remember a single commercial he was in that I didnt like Ahhh, I thought Ingram was better but thats probably Saints colored glasses I saw that Dame is a 96 on 2K now They just dropped some Dame pack and he posted it with a 96 rating Dame always rates out in the fastest to counting stats tho Guys arent that consistent from year 1 in the league to year 7 the way he has Or get the keys to the offense from your first season Dame is the real #BornReady Holy shit Houmie believes in the blazers I truthfully never thought Id see the day Im gonna run and text terry right now No absolutely not They had a paper that confirmed it at Sloan last year Or two years ago That said the hot hand is in fact a thing Idk about momentum That backfield will be a fantasy nightmare And somehow not white Gunned down in his prime Brock you just inspired me to gamble Golden State +145 tonight https://twitter.com/cosmis/status/1105996445663064066?s=21 I need to still How is it Lmao that would be amazing if he has any money leftover after suing Westbrook My order at McD every time is a McChubble Senator Swaggerless SuperLiga bet of the night: Kings +7.5 at Boston, getting Marvin Bagley back tonight Thats a good flex He really is the Big 3 guy, cant knock that Only mistake ice cube ever made Dude the Big 3 is legit And Ice Cube and LL cool J just bought 21 regional fox sports networks from Disney Big 3 going up??????

Wow so betting on temple is basically betting on the huskies Harden and CP really killed it And most importantly: Turners team lost ? FOH Matt smh I still havent filled mine out Im still cramming ? You guys Ive had drinks My final 4 is mostly chalk But Ive got some surprises in the early rounds I picked us to go far cause Im a fucking homer I think my low key bet of the day right now is Abilene Christian +20 I also like Bradley to cover 17.5 Ian I think I may have taken over the nba betting hot hand, in part thanks to Mark last night Won 100 last night on Dame +28.5 points I know Let me live I have nevada in the elite 8 too Losing to the Zags Tennessee has a brutal matchup tho Colgate is good Thats my crazy upset of the tourney Loving this start from my LSU tigers Love a good team with a scandal that led to a coach firing Hes just away from the team right? Idk Dame is very into true religion So the team follows suit Its my least favorite quality about dame Im hedging my Auburn Sweet 16 pick with New Mexico State moneyline I was worried about Auburn even tho I really like them God fuck you Yale Belmonte! Yeah gimme Belmont 10 Bradley +1200 Lets get lit! Thats sick!

Never a doubt Rengel when you trying to head over to spirit I can leave pretty much whenever Ok cool Im glad I abbreviated them as Virgin on my bracket cause their tourney performances do not fuck Rengel I will probably be at spirit in like 15 minutes so Ill get a table Artis Gilmore a Hooper You guys we may have to soon start a dialogue about Virginia not winning in the tournament since the Charlottesville nazi rally I do not Wow I guess thats it then. Virginia is cancelled. Seated at spirit By pop a shot In the back row Buffalo-ASU is a stayaway Buffalo is lit dude Im not In last is all I can say I need Colgate to come through It can get me back in it I just need a few of these upsets to hit Also Georgia state over Houston Dude the tourney is that a lot
Of times And the matchup for Colgate was good Per my 15 dollar March Madness e book Also Georgia State 5-out offense Is gonna give houston problems Colgate came through with the cover at least Pey Pey The cam smith Matt cox conspiracy Louie the king and Kenny Wooten making big Plays We are grinding Wisconsin out Trust the process That guy is a major character in Ball in the familys Im about to do a meme on this Reverse ? Lavar did help get the G league to institute a higher pay scale But he cost Lonzo money Both things can be true Cant blame him for Gelo And yall watch LaMelo is gonna be in the league He didnt rob a fucking store in China And hes also not built for school Gelo is a townie in the true sense of the word. Idk dude just watching him on the show He just doesnt have it Its completely on the couch analysis True Maybe, maybe not but hes gone on the record that he didnt want to go to school Like hes the guy who loves hoop more than anyone but hes just not that good. I wish he could be like the family lawyer or some shit But he clearly doesnt want to do that Okay but not everyone is the same idk Im just saying how I see it Melo is gonna make it Gelo will be fine Like Melo has offers from Duke and Kentucky. You are blinded by your hatred for LaVars methods that you cant see how good LaMelo Is Thats my favorite thing about the Ball fam The complete inability for people to assess the kids as players because of their father Everyone gets a brain cramp cause of Lavar Check Zos plus minus And their defensive stats He just got hurt DLo is better right now but Lonzo will be better Im not making up the numbers Their defense was top 5 when he was healthy and bottom 5 when he got hurt I respect Tacko PAC 12 was born in it. Molded by it. Cant believe the LIBs got a win OH IO David Lighty for 3!!!! Gimme 10 on the racers I threw down 30 on the racers via bovada ?

That wasnt Livingston bad but it was bad Thank god he was wearing leggings Or else his bone woulda popped out First hit of weed after finishing my game story thought: its time to bring LaMarcus home If pop retires after the season I think we could get him for very little Also dame started talking about nurkic coming over to see Dame Jr after practice just because and I nearly cried in the locker room ? Yeah probably start Zach and go small with the second unit Play more Layman More Hood If we get CJ back we have a chance to win a series if we get the clippers maybe Yeah I mean Kanter will be the 8th guy in the regular season But once the playoffs start, I could see 7 man rotation Harkless is playing his best ball of the year Skal baby! Haitian Nurk! Dude theres no deal I dont think This shit isnt going to trial lmao The Chicago police is, unfortunately, not very trustworthy The whole put him back in the game down 30 to get a 60 piece is fraudulent Hes good But the milestone chasing is a fucking joke Booker is an amazing scorer for sure And his playmaking has improved this year as well Yeah I mean the Suns are in a historically bad run right now I dont think thats his fault Their team just has a major design flaw; they dont have a point guard Theyre talented but ill equipped to function as a unit imo Dane has also been tweeting mad recklessly Yeah dude log off for a minute Idk probably Gordon Chris Bosh was so underappreciated For sure HOF Good point But at large Yeah signing a 5-year after LeBron left Showed a lot of respect Listen Chris Bosh had a great moment tonight Lets just leave it at that LeBron wouldnt have won a ship without him ? ? ? ?

Lmaooo noway Oh guys Also I was sitting next to Casey when he sent the PG quote to dame Dames response: pussy shit I think they technically have voted already https://www.instagram.com/p/BwpQdKmn4Fq/?igshid=rgmw2zxs6dnp He did Redemption Game 5 is on NBA TV Also I hope yall cashed out on blazers +155 for the series Also Calabros call So much better than Mike and Mike Their roster sucks man Patrick Patterson was a waste of money They really relied on Felton Watching that shit on tv just added a whole other level to it Nah hes going to the Knicks ? You guys I think dame would put up a good fight even tho Westbrook is more explosive they arent that different in size I know who I would take in basketball He couldnt back Dame down for being stronger tho That was what made the whole rock the baby thing so funny Westbrook is taking contested midrange jumpers acting like he just overpowers dame Hes so powerful he cant get to the rim I would have drowned in breakside ipas if I lived anywhere near it Thank you for your bravery Holy shit RosenSZN Patrick fucking Beverley is the Captain now Who cares Pat Bev is the franchise And yet hes a pirate looking dude from the southsidrn Southside Dude hes hard core chi Oh my b Anybody wanna bet me on bucks Celtics I want Celtics 50 bucks on the series Jaylen brown and Jayson Tatum are going to show Milwaukee what playoff basketball is like Not to mention uncle drew Giannis has never been here! Bud? Who cares The Celtics have 5 guys they can throw at him Bodies matter more than strategy in the nba playoffs imo Im glad we bet Thats the thing Nobody can stop him But Boston can stop everybody else Make Giannis score 60 points a game George Hill is washed Who is sterling brown! DJ Wilson? Who! I hate Boston But the fucking Celtics Are just deeper When Semi Ojeleye benches Giannis on the post >>>> ? The Celtics have a bunch of stars who have actually won in the playoffs before Congrats to Brogdon and Middleton for beating the pistons With Blake griffin on a bad knee Dubov I will bet you too I have held firm on this take since October Boston is the deepest team in the league I think its Boston or Toronto The bucks arent the 77 blazers Yes And what about the second 4! Playoff series are at least 9 deep Its a risk It means betting on the Celtics to think about the team and the bigger overall bag above their own conceptions is themselves I feel like theyve seen enough guys get bags to see winning gets you paid The Celtics are mercenaries The regular season shit is meaningless They were waiting for this moment Detroit is also garbage But include the last two years Man I believe those Celtics teams knew some shit The way they dominated Philly Milwaukee has never been there Even 538 had a study that showed experience matters In the nba playoffs Dude but LeBron had to lose first He didnt just go from the first round to the finals
 Hes too afraid of accountability To ever do that Dude the Lakers are just depressing He fucked it Up By going there The lakers are succession Clippers will win one before the lakers Oh my god montrezl fucked my bitch Watching the tnt broadcast of dames shot was incredible Lou Will! ?

The rockets dropping opposition research on the warriors I feel like sports are a more widely accepted part of the drinking culture on the east coast too. In my little experience anyway Yeah its nice having the option https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAzUy1xFH54 Lets gooooooooo 6 I want both teams to lose Damn RIP john Singleton Legendary Boyz N Da Hood director https://twitter.com/harrisonwind/status/1123020345101840384?s=21 So upset I didnt go to Denver These ticket prices are stupid Hell yeah I had no feel on this game whatsoever so I didnt bet I did not expect this At home pounding tequila like god intended https://twitter.com/bruceely/status/1123024866901258240?s=21 Im down for G2 If we want to plan that one I could do Pour Sports or something like that Wow the cowards at Bovada havent posted series prices Yup Where at? Hell yeah Thanks bro Is he playing e sports? ?This is exactly how I imagine Rick Fox speaks so this is perfect ? Blazers in 4 Dude we were just baptized with LeBron second round energy The Nuggets are the Raptors of the West ?? I thought Danny green cashed that shot Couldnt believe he missed God I honestly havent been fired up for a Blazers game like this in almost 20 years He should be But its the NBA that hates him Not other teams They thought he was bad for the league Is it worse than this rockets warriors bullshit? Monta Ellis with better range Im gonna name my child enes Rod Hood coming up huge Lets ducking go! 30 percent this year What the hell was that That was a good first half Dame hasnt even gone crazy yet Blazers got this So much so I just bet 50 bucks on the live line Seriously, Dame got this. Dame is already benefitting from the Rockets bullshit The grift will aid is *us That call was shit Jokic shouldnt get a whistle cause he lacks core strength Removed a laugh from Morris first in the nba in 3rd quarter points under 30 seconds lol We got this Lillard getting the Morey whistle! Evan turner defense! I hope so Still a lot of time Im not either but we just need some stops If we get a few I believe Dame can get us the buckets Ugh thats brutal Dude what is moe supposed to do Jokic has fat privilege That was brutal Wow Seth come on Live line was 8.5 Please do not foul I should have too I also think we ignored him too much We need CJ to run point Just to change things up Every so often God it does suck that we blew the Rodney Hood Game We just gotta be better Dame got ripped too many times by Jokic Cant have that shit Yeah right now Durant is just automatic Hes the best player in the world Giannis aint ready Yeah FOH Kenneh Yeah them choosing Russ over Harden is the one nobody talks about He stepped up tonight too Im totally gonna watch but Ive never wanted to watch a series less Maybe but he did good adjustments yesterday Greg Monroe X factor last night Fair When they play inspired on defense they really become different. Simmons did a good job on Kawhi But theyre so maddeningly inconsistent they wont keep it up Im kinda with Ian here Philly is the only team I would argue that isnt better than the Non-Warriors west Just because their bench is terrible But they also have the best starting 5 Philly is a bad matchup for the Blazers They have trouble with quick guards I mean the blazers are a bad matchup for Philly Celtics regular season data was poisoned And I think to an extent Milwaukees regular season was overvalued I mean that was my pre-series take But whether it turns out is TBD They lost to Portland tho! (And beat Portland by 43) Lmaooo @ westerners The Ayatollah of Milwaukee is good, Westerners believe By Nance? I feel like the Lakers got to him lol Im convinced the Lakers are the mafia How does that Luke Walton lawsuit not come out until after he leaves the Lakers? This is terrible https://twitter.com/jumpman23/status/1122914190329561088?s=21 Every day man Ive honestly lost the ability to feel any type of way about it Yes maduro is holding on because he has the generals in the military as well as support from Russia and China Guaido kind of just showed up, he won a parliamentary election of some sort because the actual elections are pretty widely acknowledged, even among former government members, as completely rigged But Guaido is also doing this knowing full well the people of Venezuela cant take this anymore His politics aside, he wants maduro out because people want him out And Maduro literally releases people from jail To be government loyalists on television Because there are none left Maduro has also made deals with a lot of motorcycle gangs in Caracas Im not even joking lol It all sounds like an insane movie My Uncle got jumped in east Venezuela taking shit to the dump, he refers to the climate as Mad Max So there you go lol He can win Florida again if he does its smart by him Maduro gave Trump 500k for his inaugural to try and buy him I just dont think theres a lot of trust on either side of this Putin and Trump helped each other but I dont think they trust each other Lmaooo I havent been watching but Ajax is a team of destiny I dont see any foul props on bovada either I guess this means we have to go to Vegas https://twitter.com/uproxxsports/status/1123326163575816194?s=21 I have 75 on the Celtics lol 65 on the spread and 10 on the ML Ian we have 50 on the series yes Bruh we cant do anything else Put our best two defenders on him Kanter sure as shit cant do anything At least those guys can get into his dribble And we will see it Jokic gets such a favorable whistle in Game 2 Put the better players on him period Go down with your best guys imo And without Nurk its those two Ok you have a problem but what is your solution? How do we force him to stay out there? Kanter on Millsap also has bait potential Force them out of what they normally do to attack a mismatch This might be a Layman series Haga haha Damn Sorry Matty The exact opposite of rockets-warriors Im an east coast basketball snob now Wow no wonder the Jordan ad was shit Laundry Service did it That video is one of the worst hack jobs Ive ever seen Also the guy I know in Jordan, Dan Harbison, is kinda lame lmao. So its not all on the agency Definitely Tatum post ups are my least favorite Celtics play Ive heard claws is actually good Also Karrueche is on it do Kyrie having a forgettable game He wont do that again I got a lot more big games on Kyries resume than anyone else in the series I trust him Irrational confidence god No He was sick Austin Rivers Reggie Jackson Terry rozier Patrick Beverley Nene would put Draymond on the churrasco Removed an exclamation from +5.5 lets go! Im trying to recover from my Celtics loss on +5 Also jus put 10 on Houston +400 Live Warriors are the kings of moving picks Like we could do this shit all day I hate both teams so much lol But for economic reasons Im rooting for Houston I think Draymond has potential As a new age Barkley #FutureBlazer I feel like Blake would be bored by it But hes funny enough Lmfaoooo He is an Olshey guy A first His contract is so big Yeah but I dont think it has to be a lottery pick is what I mean At his price point, cap relief is a big deal I mean it would be that and a prospect Some young player or two that the pistons like Like Simons Lmao no way 10 million cap hit Is not worth cutting him Omg this could be an epic backdoor Wow CJ over 21.5 is -105 on bovada I think he only had 17 last game 4 Lets do Century! Im going with some blazers twitter folks Lmao nah she wont Callahan and I are discussing online as we speak Occasionally but we are tweeting Yeah thats not an option for me lmao I think so man I think their digital team is literally just Oliver Maroney And they dont pay him I just saluted the Clyde mural as I rode by on a scooter The equivalent of lighting a candle Quickness!!!! Lmaoooo Freedom of offensive expression! Questionable He got cut It looks like But more Collins bloody nose for Kanter He reached in with his face Holy shit It honestly goes:

Jokic
Walton
Sabonis For the greatest passing bigs in no particular order Lol 3 euros and bill Walton But Im talking 7 footers I forgot Joakim Noah At his peak He was elite Dude all passing isnt in stats, look at Westbrook Wilt was the same way Just did it for the stats Not for the team Yes hes great at outlets but Im not considering him as a goat In passing Fair Aminu hive Statistically the 2000 Blazers are one of the best teams of the millennium Like theyre right there with Steve Nashs Suns teams as the best to never get a ring ?????? Palestinian Chicken We are 30% from 3 Thats an out of shape miss We got lucky This is insanity I love Enes Kanter Who knows Terrible call Put turner in there before he gets suspended Lets gooooooo Wow https://twitter.com/royceyoung/status/1123792806424784896?s=21 We matches brookyn Brooklyn Yes We eventually traded him for cap relief it was a bad match Stotts gave the bench freedom tho Sitting dame and CJ at the same time was a low key big move for now We can stagger them now but our bench feels good and confident now Also Zach Collins His balls dropped tonight Just an absolute grown man game Well Donovan doesnt help us win lmao Love in the moment! Live* Insane He cant sleep cause of the shoulder pain so hes mad online to dull the pain Enes Kanter will never stop going in https://twitter.com/kriskoivisto/status/1123813249919725568?s=21 Were gonna need him Big 3 gotta raise the age limit Steve Blake not getting in is a travesty He said it was a bad roll And he didnt commit to playing on Game 3 That makes the most sense, I think terry likes Hood off the bench more than as a starter This is so weird to have wing depth ZC is also 7 foot Cam Tbh You guys kinda look the same? You guys honestly look like brothers lmao Yeah pretty crazy I still havent decided to bet this game I really have no fucking clue about this series Man that philly defense was incredible Fuck it Im betting on Philly https://twitter.com/dbearak/status/1124030913124491264?s=21 Jesus Christ DLo Dont put the weed in a fake beverage container! You cant bring beverages on flights! Jesus Christ I usually do edibles but I accidentally had a few joints flying from Palm Springs in my carry on and nothing happened Theyre looking for bombs Not weed New York is the only place Ive been worried about it and I didnt even have any An old lady in my building who told me she doesnt like basketball is super into the blazers now ? And whoever loses that series too lol https://twitter.com/blazerfreeman/status/1124067050425659392?s=21 I like that BK is short for woke Hes just a relentless blazers hater I dont get it Philly up 15 midway 3rd quarter Kawhi is such a monster That was not okay Like come on You dont kick a guy like that That doesnt make what Pascal did okay! Yeah maybe we are Lol Especially on bigs Theyre getting their asses kicked and he lost his cool Thats what happened lol Yes but this is avoidable you know? Moose is in the game now Pascals play was very extra Embiid!!!! Windmill!!! ? Ill be there! Yes but only kind of Im just tracking down and transcribing quotes for the AP this series Meyers Leonard You guys Maybe its my morning wake and bake But I cant stop seeing the parallels between the 2019 Blazers and Sixers and the 1977 versions of them The sixers are the more talented mercenary team Blazers are the better TEAM But then they started liking him lol They ended the season all kinds being okay with each other and I think the bulls dont really care Also hes cheap For sure ? Fuck it I dont know for sure but Im fairly certain Zach Collins is rewatching film from last game and he referred to Jokic as filet mignon It is but it still means Zach is eating Hes eating very fine and expensive cut of meat Hes taking about Jokic on defense tho Yeah and Im not gonna do that to him but I thought it was funny Terry literally said that it was such a weird flex by Woj Lol Jaylen picking up 5 is tough Im disappointed in Kyrie Smh God I love Kanter If they dont win Game 4 its obviously over, but they just need to win and pressure is back on the Bucks to win Game 5 at home Giannis was great tonight Boston bench also was a no-show tonight I think Boston still has a chance But I feel less good about it now. That was a big boy win by the bucks Jamal is ballin Denver has better hands than OKC They are also forcing it out of his hands every time Nuggets fucked up Fat Privilege Kanter back in Oh my god Blood pressure Jokic is dead We must attack 4 more for the over!!!! My god please Dame Jesus Give CJ 3 max contrates I feel like Ive just had too much sex Jesus Christ Fresh legs Epic Wow not even sharing my tweet about Kanter smh CJ is gonna be an all star next year If we make the conference finals Definitely pops Also Im so proud of blazers fans for the Kanter chants I dont think he plays in Game 4 He was like almost in tears just getting up and sitting down from his chair lol Dude Meyers might be a smart play in Game 4 cause of how tired Jokic might be Maybe enes will get cbdd up and play I truly think Seth made it in photoshop lmaoo Ill ask him lmao Its a vision Confirmed photoshop ? Corona Familiar SZN I blame the Houston Rockets for this Kentucky derby shit Oh my god more overtime Bruuuuh What the hell happened Scott Foster for the blazers game!!! I dont think it matters Im good lol Chuck is a Blazers national media hipster Nurkic is here https://twitter.com/bigjohnnep/status/1125164608610717696?s=21 This is gonna go to another fucking level Brutal He cant play 48 minutes??? Jesus Kyrie has lost his mind Mamba Poisoning This is the 2nd best series Wow and Bledsoe Harden putting one on Mirotic has been so key Damn my homie definitely probably wrote that copy too lmao Yeah Game 1 was the time to fire off that tweet lol LaMarcus too Actually Kyrie did lmao Ill stay if youll have me At a fan event To me Kyrie did it worse lmao Lets just say I was told LaMarcus wasnt exactly forthcoming with his guarantee in 2014 That was Neils idea We need a big man! Neil tried to get LaMarcus to sign an extension but it was after 0.9 and Neil wanted to keep us good vibes going so he called The Oregonian to give them the story about how LaMarcus wants to be the best blazer of all time Chris Haynes was pissed he didnt get the story and he hits up LA to see why he didnt get it, LA tells Haynes Neil made him talk to the Oregonian So its all up to how much we believe LA vs. believing Neil and I believe LA lol God theres so many good names for this one The wave The last word Also dame hitting his 3s would be dope Hes getting fewer looks but hes gotta cash them Dame is shooting 26 percent On 3s Like thats the difference of 3 or 4 He gets just a few more to go and that changes everything I think hes healthy, I just think the nuggets play better defense than OKC As a team And maybe guarding Murray is taking more out of him than guarding Russ Also its not just Harris. When he crosses halfcourt hes got Harris and another guy shading him OKC was lazy with the details Yeah Aminu and Harkless need to get some good shots This team is just steely as fuck I will never count them out until theyre out Denver fans suck And they dont even really care lmao https://twitter.com/chold/status/1125809881791942656?s=21 Correct We are gonna win ? Mike rice retweeted me I dont need any because I would instantly OD It was on in the barbershop I couldnt believe it Epic choke by Barcelona That missed 4th goal at the end of leg 1 killed them This is a game I am watching alone Alone with the Superliga Of course I salute you Dubov Im about to go to the gas station and guy familiar *get I havent gone to a game alone in a long time but I enjoyed it When I did Its pretty lit Dude thats what that guy Patrick from Des Moines did in the last game 5 in Portland https://twitter.com/erik_gundersen/status/1120873425919078401?s=21 Im just saying look what happened next!

Lakers! For the 4th pick Lets gooooooooooo What a terrible call Not a great start for Moe and Chief Rodney the god Loving our defensive approach so far Make things difficult on the splash bros and make everyone else beat you I think our bench is better Arrogance! Australian League MVP Hood played great defense Jesus Luck And theyre only up 7 We good I think so CJ can chase him He just won us Game 7 Its time to grift Aminu has to shoot that shit The more he dribbles the worse it is Our defense is on point I just wanted Sonya to know how much i care Thank god dame is cool with the cops I mean refs Dame is the Nipsey Hussle of superstars Building bridges with the cops to build a better world We need Moe on him Fuck this dame shit Lets fucking go I want to fuck our off-ball defense I hate when I agree with Johnny. C https://twitter.com/johncanzanobft/status/1128496320828755968?s=21 I honestly thought we were okay on them No not that But off ball I thought our attention was great Out help on their little screens in the corner was good I think we can still win We played like shit The weak spots are in the armor ?????? We got this you guys We played like shit And still had a chance to steal that game Dude huge moment I love it It incentivized the blazers way of team building And the Heat, Ian Even if Miami didnt benefit this time Dude but not just that If we are gonna drop we gotta put Moe on Steph Thats what he has to do tho and hes better at that than Dame There is no scheme for stopping them and we are not Houston Draymond is the one guy I am scared to hedge on Apparently the players were pissed with terry too ?? All warriors media already calling the series over I even read a story about Jordan Bells new mindset Thats how much theyre feeling themselves Because he banked in a stupid shot yesterday Literally every time I go to New York I see more warriors gear than anything lol But everyone hates them lol Well guys I just logged into synergy to see how we played golden state last time we played them in the playoffs Drop coverage in all three games I watched Yeah man Im not sure what theyre gonna do Im telling you They just need to move the scheme up the fucking floor They can have the same principles But they cannot be at the free throw line anymore Kanter just has to be in Stephs face coming around the screen but he can still hold him off until Harkless or whoever recovers ? If Kevin Love can get up to the level of the screen and recover I think Kanter can too ? From Game 6 I just dont know how we didnt get that in the gameplan for Game 1 Cant happen in Game 2 I was watching the first quarter of that Or no the 8-1 series Kanter can exploit them on the other end tho If we dont turn it over and miss every shot He can be marginally better defensively And it would make a difference Yeah what made Dame so good in Game 6 was he let the game come to him He got into it defensively first Got a few steals Then he got going Whats the line Ian? For the championship? We also gotta give dame a break from guarding Steph Its an unnecessary waste of energy I put like 20 on them on bovada after my blazers bet cashed just to hedge lol I have Toronto at like +600 Toronto just completely flustered right now God Kawhi is like Jordan I do too but they were able to stop Kyrie, idk if they can really stop Kawhi Its gonna be way more competitive Then Boston I know Pascal is showing up early They cant guard him with Ilyasova Having Marc Gasol as like, your 5th best player, is pretty sick https://twitter.com/magicstweets/status/1128837404427636742?s=21 Best defense Ive ever seen Brook Lopez play Any Game 2 plans Portland Superliga? Charles still believes in the blazers I just think its worse cause he had the chance of LA or NY Ill take it Mark! 10? Then I will bet the minimum The sharps loved Portland in Game 1 too I think hes hurt I think he could miss the series He was supposed to be re-evaluated today and Ramona shelburne said hes not close They really dont think they need him CJ went to south Enrolled in the IB program and ran the school paper Blazers hitting Stephs fucked up hand Giving me life Its the fucking playoffs! Aminu also somehow got 9 points Just completely folding We got this Love&Loyalty And then he shit on the dubs Meyers is a fucking pro Im drinking I believe again Get the hate out of your heart Meyers is laying it on the line for blazers basketball 1 point game Brutal Im not getting off until after Saturday We were down 0-2 in 1977 Until we are down 0-3 we will not relent Zach and enes have to step up Meyers playing better than both is unacceptable! So guys Im about to rewatch the game but my first thought for Game 3: Start Meyers Kanter has been bad in both games He cant post up Draymond I just dont know what our other option is given Zachs propensity to foul Maybe Kanter will play better at home I just want someone to take advantage of that fucking trap on dame Meyers was good at that last night He also had two fuck ups in the first quarter Overhelping on a Draymond drive and missing a box out on Looney on another Yeah I think we are also learning the hard way these guys arent the nuggets and will make us pay for any small mistake Well the good news is that Zach probably couldnt play any worse He doesnt get to the line Its one of the weirdest things about his success https://twitter.com/truehoop/status/1129423141846036480?s=21 Also canzano called out CJ For going 0-6 in the 4th How? Dude the blood clot killed Ingrams value tho Damn they can trade AD for three core pieces from the 9th seeded Heat or pieces from a team in the conference finals hmm Simons is sick! And so is Collins And Nurk Dude he scored 38 How many dudes on the Heat have ever scored 38 He didnt even play college basketball! Hes a child Oh yeah and Kyle Kuzma is better? Hes fine No Collins is Oh god Kuzma literally cant defend anybody Not like kuzma but I think Collins contributes more to winning Ill wait until he has 5 blocks in Game 3 Just like he did in Game 6 against fucking Jokic Collins is younger By a solid two years Defensively its not even close He had two bad games And looney is gonna get paid this summer And? He also looked bad in Game 1 against OKC and Denver? And then he fucking dominated in both of those series He was in foul trouble It happens Im not gonna lower his trade value off of the first two games of this series after how he finished the last two Dude he played well in every single win The blazers have had Sure but they had fewer of them! Game 7 he had huge blocks and 3s Well no shit Thanks Houman Im aware the blazers revolve around dame and cj But they dont make it to the WCF without Collins And hes gonna get a huge contract because of it Both of those guys And Collins trade value in the league very high Well obviously Ian doesnt Based off of David fucking Thorpe thinking he would be a piece in an AD trade With Nurkic, a borderline All-Star and Simons, a baby who scored 38 points in an nba game already Hes pretty close to kuz In value If kuz didnt play for the Lakers You wouldnt believe hes god Collins has won playoff games and Kuz has never been there and you look at me like out of my mind I get scoring is more important But the gap is not as wide as you claim it to be Whose fault is that? Hes a great scorer But he needs to become a better 3 point shooter Dude but thats how perceptions change Playoff performances mean more to nba people like it or not Who made this rule? Lol Brook Lopez doesnt matter? That game doesnt get him another year or two in free agency? Who just signed on a minimum deal Who is a role player on the Bucks All Im saying is Collins has improved his value and you guys just think shitting on the blazers players is a stand in for actual analysis That package is good You are wrong How is it insane if they want a youth movement in New Orleans with Zion? Thats a young package and it has a lot of upside if you believe in your program Dude Boston isnt gonna do the AD deal The wizards arent They wont deal with the Lakers Name a team Give me a package Throw in two firsts With Portlands And find one that is better when you include Ingrams blood clot and Lonzo not wanting to go to New Orleans Thats one Its really not that easy considering Bostons instability and the Nets courting Kyrie/KD and having Russell as a free agent And the Clippers going after Kawhi I guess Toronto could? Siakam/OG The rest of the trade sucks is why Portlands aggregation is talent is better than that Booker? Now thats a trade But would Miami really do that? God josh Jacksons value All time low I mean hell yeah then But Winslow is about to get paid right? And Richardson soon? The great thing about Portlands trade is all those guys are cost controlled except Harkless who will probably get less on free agency Fair enough I just have to think two guys on rookie deals and a good center at a fixed cost is pretty good but if the Knicks move No. 3 that wins Along with Robinson I dont like Kevin Knox lol And DSJ is still tbd I mean its reliable insofar as the salary cap stuff But not at telling you whats actually feasible Fantasy draft Madden Was so epic Mike Vick, Randy Moss and Tony Gonzalez all on the same team Watching Desus and Mero react to the Knicks lottery made my day Coke or opioids It wasnt PEDs I would have a 5 game suspension every year WHO WAS ON CRACK Clay is so hip Next to my old burgerville What a bitch You guys center court courtside is only 1,300 bucks for tonight Rumors are theyre changing the starting lineup But we dont know what it is Terry reads this group chat Meyers is starting Lmao yes Its on the scoreboard Welcome to the Meyers revolucin Iguodala might be hurt I just saw Doris walk to the locker room to get the update Iguodala back on the bench Is Meyers the best Leonard in the NBA? Finally Bell stealing points in this series he finally have it back Hes gassed dude Guarding the warriors is exhausting Rodney is in Jesus Jesus Christ please make these CJ 20-33 Jesus Christ This series has to be killing Nurkic Fucking looney landing on him in Game 2 Yeah its both If we had fucking nurkic man Omg lmao Tim is actually a friend of mine but he totally deserves to get dragged for that shit Hes also just doing it for the clicks Its completely shameless And it also alienates fans Its dumb Yeah man its like just maybe consider that people are bummed And dont troll them When theyre bummed Yeah dude So shitty Warriors wont have Iguodala so I hope we can get at least 1 Brook Lopez game winner? Middlecum Bruh Siakam is like a rich mans aminu Like what the fuck Everybody on the Cavs last year just got way more athletic and way more clutch LeBron really is a drag lmao Also I think Giannis and Dame are the best leaders in the nba Draymond + Steph is a combo deal Im watching always sunny to reset after I was fine with it but it was no longer appointment viewing after the battle of winterfell imo Its honestly fine lol Theres so many other good breakfast places Dude The Lakers havent played in almost two months and we are about to reel off our best two months on the site lol Also he doesnt even know how much hes owning himself in these interviews I felt like Rob Pelinka was backstabbing me by telling people I wasnt in the office when I wasnt in the office He might have a promise Busy day on the content field today boys That would be a bummer They have to at least hold onto Meyers next season cause of nurkic Batum and Matthews Specifically 2013-14 Batum and Matthews Thank god the warriors Turned it over so much my god Feels like thats the series I thought that was going in No way That touched Klay Lol Jesus guys dame got a corner 3 for the win lol His drive was way worse Tough scene Matty: I just saw dieter chest bump a fellow media member Turner would be a good trade piece since hes expiring We kind of need Meyers next year man Nurkic isnt gonna be back until 2020 So our centers will be Zach Collins and.... For over 60 percent of the season Houman are you unaware that you need five people to play basketball Oh my god You guys need to look up what words mean They do need him to start the season like it or not They have no other centers except zach cause Kanter is gone Im not sure why terry did so much Evan over moe down the stretch Yes dude Corbin is the homie I did! He was not in Chicago but he hosts a podcast with the guy from Chicago Uhh so terry might not be back unless he gets an extension Is what that Haynes article also says The team has an option But hes apparently pissed he wasnt extended already ? Hes already taking less than he could If he waited until next summer He could get the Westbrook bag Ahh I thought he could get past 200 M He would unlock another level of payment next years With 8 years of service Im pretty sure How depressed were we after Nurk? Yeah literally weve run into the warriors in 3 out of the last 4 years its like running into the bulls I mean, yes but how is that different than any other team who has played golden state over this era? Erasing big leads is one of their hallmarks. I think our series in 2016 with them had a similar outcome in 5 games, we had the lead for longer Totally but I also cant be mad they didnt Honestly we are getting back there next year I think thats actually a good chance of happening Chad ET hates Stotts We discussed an ET for Baze deal Last night after the games That would be helpful Like the ideal guy is a veteran with two years left On a team thats building around a younger window Yes like Conley Another one I like is Kyle Anderson Or TJ warren For Conley? If Im Portland no Utah Is basically it Miami is a little bit different tho cause I think he helps them be in playoff contention which is what Riley wants??? Also guys I got a Shaun King RT today cause I put kaepernick in a headline #engagement Yeah and their leverage goes down the second they take Ja Also I dont think I can pick against the warriors in the finals Its gonna be 7 Against Milwaukee and I think they can still beat them Yeah Draymond is better than ever??? Yeah true https://twitter.com/joe_sba/status/1130601064363958272?s=21 This is the greatest thing Ive ever seen Low key thinking about getting an Anfernee Simons jersey If we have him into next season Then I will get a Simons jersey Gotta keep the options open Multi year extension for terry Already did lol Wow!!! https://twitter.com/jamiehudsonnbcs/status/1130940500045778944?s=21 Jody Allen!!! No sale! Hell yeah The national media has been wrong about the blazers for years tho its been so much of the same today The ringer cant think of any other alternatives other than trading your star players CJ was the best player in the Denver series. Yeah its just that he was great against OKC and really good against Denver Hes an assistant coach bro Hes like part time I dont think he travels Hes also not at games but he is always at the facility I will ask him later if we dont know I dont wanna bother him tho He also wouldnt tell me most likely Terry is probably already on the golf course And turned off his phone I already lose enough money when I try to win I dont need to throw money in the garbage Most likely not I think we could get Aminu for like 32/4 Maybe even 28/4 Because he likes it here Brooklyn is gonna try and get him but he would have to wait for them to try and sign stats *stars I think Kyrie It would be so Kyrie That would be perfect honestly Or maybe KD to Brooklyn And Kemba to New York with x I wish we could get Marcus Morris It would be a great fit if I just dont know how we do it Cause we need help getting there and he usually helps us with that Also Kawhi Going all out https://twitter.com/danfavale/status/1131024975597580288?s=21 Fair enough Yeah just the issue is we have aminus bird rights and if we lose him we only have like 5 million to sign someone else Yeah not having hoods blows But maybe we could give him like 4 years/20 million? Or 3 years/15? Via the mid level? I need to refresh my cap shit Thats honestly not bad for Hood Idk how many people give him more Probably like 5-6M/year Now we will have at most five days without hoops Thats incredible Chad! Ill see if he gets back to me He did but he called me Eric, feeling that new contract ignorance lmao I would wait Until the deadline I wouldnt do it now tho Like lets wait and see what happens with Detroit and stuff I wouldnt pull the trigger on Love when we could potentially get Blake or something better with our experience *expirings Like Anthony Davis you try now But love is one you wait for Stephen A Smith voted dame first team Hes a forward I think But like as Chad said, its either LeBron or you drop to LaMarcus or Bojan Bogdanovic Id go Ben Simmons over LeBron but I think hes a guard Positions are dumb lol I got the Mercury but I wanted the Aces Wow KD out for the start of the finals If they beat the bucks or raptors without him I wont feel so bad Yeah if they win without him hes for sure leaving Giannis is now eligible for the biggest contract in NBA history lol Last year would pay him 54 million lol NFL media is so upset Lmao wait Bakkens wedding is in McMinnville like Dylans? ?????? Oh my god lmaooooo Goddamnit lol Pascal Siakam is just 1.5 Aminus tbh. Maybe 1.25 Pascal Siakam is Aminu with a higher exchange rate Are brothers going to Oregon-Auburn I am leaning towards going I need vengeance I think we could make it 6 We beat each one At home And the bucks clearly have issues with small guards Kyle Lowry is racking up numbers!!!! Blazers can win the west Period I dont think Houston can be a better regular season team than Portland We will be 1-2-3 But it also does If we didnt have more wins we play golden state in the 2nd round I tried to get Matty to peep her in Vegas lmao He missed it Smh hes cheating on me https://twitter.com/steven_lebron/status/1131957325558878210?s=21 Olshey is just a fucking hustler my god https://twitter.com/stephenasmith/status/1132011246432215040?s=21 https://jalopnik.com/elon-musk-says-hyperloop-tunnel-is-now-just-a-normal-1835024474 Stick to space Elon https://twitter.com/playoffmars/status/1131926400653357061?s=21 South Salem legend Enes Kanter!!!! Bootleg dame and CJ are winning the east Lolol CJ is the same player in the playoffs that he is in the regular season The same could never be said for retozan Derozan Winning in the west is harder Look at their numbers Derozan is considerably worse in the playoffs Lowry has stabilized Look at career playoff numbers CJ and Dame are the same player in the postseason as in the regular DeMar was always worse By a lot RayPPhotos Lolol Legend https://twitter.com/hou5ton4l/status/1132444163331510272?s=21 https://twitter.com/fitzgsn_/status/1132658499157147649?s=21 Its the dumbest thing ever Milwaukee should have been able to celebrate Giannis Thats wild Right !? Also the fact that Baxter had to have a league source confirm that Heath ledger was dead before he saw the movie is the greatest thing Ive ever seen ESPN has to have an additional source to post a verifiable fact that makes Kobe Bryant look bad lmao I cant see that account either? You could replace the current storyline on HBOs Succession with these storylines and wouldnt miss a beat For starters, Pelinka made up a story that Kobe saw the Dark Knight and asked to meet with heath ledger to pick his brain after he saw it lol Thats one anecdote You really gotta carve out some time for that story lolol Lolo I need to watch last nights ep Jesus Christ What awful meme-ing An attempt at creating your own meme which is basically never how it works Oh my god who wrote these The screen writers for Shes All That on Netflix? Wait really? ?????? That would honestly be hilarious Also can we discuss how insane the raiders are and how they should be on hard knocks Incognito and AB on the same team Next year? I bet Morey could be into Meyers Honestly thats a perfect promoted tweet God JVG is being comforting and soul crushing about the blazers at the same time on the Lowe post today If they hold on to that lead in Game 2 that probably goes 7 His logic is if they win game 2 they at least get one of 2 at home lol just passing along what he said Removed an exclamation from Oh baby its official I'll be coaching at Derrick Whites camp in Denver June 24th-27th We are taking this home baby! Azerbaijan is Chelsea turf I truthfully hate to see arsenal fall apart in a big spot Its gonna suck to lose Hazard We are also on a transfer ban until next year lol I cant believe its an all England champions league Woah Okay 3-1 Unfortunately Chad is not Jewish enough to be Red I say Rick Adelman Chad, pride of Chemeketa Learn all about the corners offense God now I wanna watch that movie Wilt and Russell were sick dude They could play today imo Wilt is one of the most athletic people ever Russell, Pistol, Bird, Jordan, Shaq, LeBron I considered Barkley in Jordans spot Prime Barkley was amazing and unselfish But I think Jordan is just better on defense and all around They would figure it out bird is a genius And both are competitive AF I feel like pistol and curry would be a lowkey sick matchup My team would get all the rebounds and would have amazing help defense Oh my god LeBron James Jr. and Zaire Wade are playing together for Sierra canyon next year I think Pippen is going to Vandy??? Yeah theyre both 2019 And both going to Vandy to play for Stackhouse I hope Sierra canyon is back at LSI next year Zaire is a senior so we will miss him He only has offers from DePaul and Nebraska right now So hes trying to level up at Canyon for sure I definitely hope I can see them play those games are going to be insane Wow Boogie Cousins active lets go Honestly I think the best chance of landing a star for our expiring contracts is next trade deadline This summer will be hard but next deadline Id say, Blake or some other star with a lot of money isnt working out Is a chance Meyers and Moe see ya That would be iconic But i think jimmy ends up with the Lakers I would have last year but he somehow made the Kings worse Idk anymore Its also the kings I mean Harry B in Aminus spot does sound pretty great Im coming around to it Yeah I would try to wait the pistons out I just dont think we need to rush this summer to make a move when a much better move could be available when the season starts CJ and Dame can get us to the playoffs With anybody around them lol https://www.instagram.com/p/ByF4Fi4HruC/?igshid=1uuiuz30zp6az Jesus ESPN BPI has Raptors with a 61% chance of winning tonight Groundbreaking stuff from Bill Simmons today: injuries hurt Zach Lowe definitely lifts Raptors up 1 with 4 minutes to go in the first half Pascal has 20 Best game of the playoffs For Siakam 79-70 with 3:25 3rd q Now 79-72 raptors He travels to road games with a guitar Up 9 with 8:25 left wow Yeah boogie played he didnt do much I am happy i hedged my Celtics bet by betting the raptors after the first game I saw them with Gasol Gasols passing is just such a difference maker Its why we missed Nurk That is absolutely false They were good as fuck! They won 54 games You had 6 teams win 50 in the west Dude Jokic was incredible Portland did beat down Philly both times they played Jokic > Embiid I did too but I picked Boston so I dont think I get credit lol Only money if the raptors win Vegas has the Celtics as the 2nd favorite preseason The east definitely improved but the west is still better Did Cleveland beating golden state in 2016 mean the East was better? Because their regular season and playoff paths were more difficult? ?????? Either way we can all agree go raptors And no Ian the east wasnt better in 15-16 Like Memphis was 42-40 but pushed the spurs that year in the first round Oh my bad it was the year after That was when Conley and Gasol were hurt When San Antonio played golden state and zaza fucked Kawhi They went to 6 against Memphis In the first round It was the last Memphis run for z-bo and Tony Allen It did tonight! Lol I thought the east had four chances to win But they were all underdogs against golden state And probably would have been against Houston If Houston beats golden state that probably changes Or its at least closer to a coin flip Milwaukee wouldnt be as favored as GSW was coming into this I dont think Iguodala getting hurt again is worrisome tho No but I mean relative to the spread in this one Milwaukees line vs Houston wouldnt be as high as Golden State v Toronto or anybody in the east I guess I just feel like we usually would say deeper was better in the 2000s Im not sure it would be different now with regards to conference strength but I get the argument for focusing on contenders I just dont necessarily feel that way I think this is going 7 Durant or not I just also think if you rank the best players in the league more of them are in the west KD, Steph, LeBron, PG, Dame, Jokic is pretty hard to top Draymond and Klay Anthony Davis KD, Steph, LeBron and PG? Swap Anthony Davis with PG I think Steph or KD Steph is like the Babe Ruth of Basketball I just hate him lol I cant believe pascal Siakam CJ for Anthony Davis its time Or James Harden Dude Nurk was the key I still believe that I said it when he went down Thats what made this entire run so insane Hes a great passer dude and he improved so much as a finisher And an amazing defender Like he accentuated everything perfectly The fit is ideal I agree with Dylan The raptors have the matchups Theyre the most athletic team in the league Ian you also know by know you cant just blanket point differential on everything and call it good I think you can weigh both and how they did in the playoffs Ian we kicked Phillys ass twice Pretty sure by at least 25 both times Yeah talk about underachievers The Celtics were one game away from the finals and then added Kyrie and Gordon Hayward Boston had more talent than anyone in the east but Philly was a better team Oh wow now we are talking wild takes Lmaoooo Come on man he had a bad series His first bad playoff series really Kyrie is top 5 PG I would say hes top 15 He was 2nd team all NBA Thats where we end up saying Jrue Holiday is elite Marcus Morris had a career year tho so that balanced it out Tatum was the biggest disappointment I thought they had the most 1-8 talent But it just didnt fit And they hated each other Middleton could get a lot of money For sure He was kind of a passenger his one year in the west with Westbrook going for the MVP Man what is Russ now? Top 20? He might be the most interesting player heading into next year https://twitter.com/thedynamics/status/1134232494008688645?s=21 https://twitter.com/otjsports/status/1134454359453065217?s=21 New Balance kinda killing it Thats fucking wild Damn thats awesome Proposal to change name to Andy Ruiz Superliga I cant believe an nba team ran a box and 1 Thats incredible Fire comedy lineup Yeah its a decent music line up for sure Shes honestly the most hype music act lol My other favorite twitter topic of the day has been black Twitter roasting dumbasses who think Chernobyl needs more POCs lmaooo Terence Howard in...CHERNOBYL https://twitter.com/uncletrini/status/1135566965702057984?s=21 This is pretty wild https://twitter.com/brkicks/status/1135664520163205121?s=21 Hahahahaha Mad Dwight Howard jokes sheesh Also I finally read the full text of the Kawhi lawsuit it was incredible Multiple references to his Large, Powerful hands Wow Looney with a fracture Out indefinitely Dude that weatherman actually has moves Wow that guy has clearly never heard of a smart doorbell Wow also USA U-20s up 3-2 In the knockout stage of the U20 World Cup va France Also Ian shams is saying the Heat are interested in JR Smith Also Utah is interested in DAngelo Tatum also had a bad year lol He was bad this year It all depends too how much Griff like RJ barrett https://twitter.com/clutchpointsapp/status/1136052190504611840?s=21 Lmaooooo Thats so funny Its the best thing for the league Also its the last time at Oracle I think Toronto can hang but golden state is coming out with their hair on fire Oh yeah thats a good bet Oh wow no Klay Hell yeah Filipinos love basketball and guns more than Americans They also love regressive drug policy more than Americans Steph learning what it feels to be like Dame Im just saying Steph is seeing how its like With only two other elite teammates What dame sees all the time Not saying we beat Toronto Steph has Draymond Green, Demarcus Cousins and Andre Iguodala But Portland has nobody else that is Draymond or Iggy level I feel like Steph is in a similar situation They have enough talent in aggregate that its really close to what the blazers are You can focus on individuals The warriors still have high end talent Even with these injuries Also Draymond was a champion at every level He was just fat He impacts winning Draymond anchors his defense and runs the offense, robert horry literally could never Damn I kind of agree there Miami would be the best team in the division Golden state wouldnt be the same at all You would at least make the playoffs and probably be a top seed Before Durant Draymond was always the extra Oomph Home court For sure It would be a lot closer than it was Draymonds impact is elite level in terms of plus minus And any other advanced metric you want to apply Hes like all the good parts of kelly olynyk without the bad ones But like imagine If everything olynyk did was better, but most of all IQ and motor Draymonds motor is the best in the NBA period Draymond would make you a lot better I wish I did I just had tequila Youve never been wrong Ian? So then what does that prove? Im just saying Steph is seeing what its like to see how Dame is guarded Theyre not garbage but Draymond is a fucking giant You are inferring I think they are trash when its truthfully my respect for Draymond Watch him in transition Then get back to me Draymond can create points out of nothing in a way nobody in Portland front court can Basketball is not solely a half court game even in the playoffs Golden state has proven that Transition is what makes them tick and Draymond is the key to all of it Its part of the fucking game dude How can you not count it I dont have to Its the same discussion It does! Because nobody playing Portland has to worry about a Draymond getting loose in transition or pushing the ball
 At least not without nurkic No Im saying Steph is seeing what Dame sees tonight Draymonds playmaking in transition is close to LeBron level Danny Green! Okay dame has never seen Box and 1 but everything else they are doing wit Steph dame has seen They can but I think what hurts them most is their other guys cant shoot. When its not All-Stars it turns into Aminu/Harkless real quick ? One of the greatest selfies in history I dont see it either Dehaan Lowry aka ?? The Ibaka Hammer ?? ???? You just hate to see it My favorite is a 73-win team was broken up to add Kevin Durant, not that Kevin Durant jointed a 73-win team. Get all the way the fuck out of here Remember when we laughed about the haters @klow7?!?l Yes I think he would stay Having fun playing ball is the ultimate expression to him imo Hes like basketball Messi The Shockers!!!!! Wow I remember LeBron playing by himself against the raptors Wow Steph fraudulent Remember when LeBron beat Toronto on his womb Own? Wow me neither https://twitter.com/rohannadkarni/status/1136478485353050112?s=21 Coke is like Ferris buehler https://youtu.be/mHa1zTLrXO8 https://twitter.com/cwilliamson44/status/1136479816977473536?s=21 What if the warriors sitting Klay out forces him to L.A. or Portland I just smoked a kief bowl We will see Kd might stay now too Especially if they lose I hope he goes to NY Klay loves seasonal shakes That would be sick Brooklyn is also a good organization Jarrett Allen, D-Lo and picks Jarrett Allen And dinwiddie Honestly Is better than the Lakers package If you include a figure pick and maybe Joe Harris? *future Ok Jarrett, Joe Harris, Dinwiddie and a pick Not as good as Lakers but it depends what you want I dont think all 3 get offered Truthfully I think its only 2 Then Lakers I would do Im just not sure thats the offer anymore Its better but I wouldnt say way because Dinwiddie and Harris are cost-controlled at team friendly deals Allen is on a rookie contract Ingram is gonna cost 20-25M Per year Starting next summer You guys big Darius garland fans? Or Jarrett Culver? Like if youre the pelicans and you get a lot of good role guys from the Nets with Zion and Jrue is sick Would you do Knicks or lakers package?

Knicks: Mitchell Robinson, 3rd pick, Kevin Knox

Lakers: Ingram, Kuzma, 4th pick What if we switch Kuzma for Lonzo to Chicago and pelicans get the 4, 6 and Ingram? Still Lakers) ? Cause thats an offer Ive seen Lonzo to the Bulls for 6 and then the Lakers put 6 + 4, Ingram to the pelicans Yeah youd probably get Garland and Culver or Garland and Hunter Along with Zion and Ingram Pelicans could be sick if thats the deal I dont think they will trade for CJ cause he makes too much money Yeah LeBron, Kuz, AD and then figure out the rest Mitchell Robinson is like the ideal center next to Zion It could be like next level DeAndre and Blake Would you still do that over 4, 6 and Ingram as well? You can choose it in the draft More than any other time Yeah the Lakers have been rumored for that move Either sending Lonzo to Chicago or Phoenix For 6 or 7 Package that with 4 and Ingram, thats the deal Allegedly People like Zach Lowe like him still I also still like him For what its worth And he will no longer where BBB shoes Thats a good sign for his injuries I hope He is an elite defender And passer His floor is bigger Ricky Rubio Like, thats really good for a floor Fox is better Ill concede Phoenix makes a lot of sense to pair him with Booker. A guy who can defend 3 positions and doesnt need the ball Same with Chicago and Zach LaVine Lonzos lack of need for the ball and ability to defend make him a fit basically anywhere you want and if youre a younger team, it makes a lot of sense to add him Lavar can only be in one place at one time Hes not a legitimate concern Lauri and Wendell are growing, they just paid LaVine All I wanna say is LeBron woulda won tonight and Steph couldnt Omg The guy courtside who shoved Kyle Lowry is a part owner of the warriors Hes gonna get Donald sterlingd real quick Brutal I think the first Latino president of basketball ops in nba history has them in a good spot Vanterpool is a great hire Hes picking the staff for Ryan Saunders and making sure its elite Houston is a mess right now Their new owner is cheap I dont think hes playing this series Lol I think Toronto is winning in 5 now If the Warriors keep defending the way they did yesterday idk if they can win I want to see what Klay looks like but even 50% Klay helps Brutal Theyre gonna try for KD and Kyrie Get season tix now He will probably get a max otter but I bet he ends up in Phoenix Brooklyn, Phoenix, Utah, Pacers apparently They banned the Warriors owner for a year and fined him 500k I thought they would force him to sell Lowry said like 20 minute ago he wanted him out of the league lol But hes obviously emotionally charged by the whole thing They just had media availability bro I was watching Does it matter whether he said it both times? Lol okay I was just watching the nba tv coverage of the press conferences from today I think the difference was today Lowry knew that guy was a part owner I literally just said that to start this conversation lmao Honestly thats huge cause they open their new arena next year That probably hurts more than the fine or having to sell his shares 500k is loose change to this guy hes worth 2.3 billion He bought 7% of the dubs from Vivek Thats the high end of what Ive heard anyway Hockey memes baby https://www.instagram.com/p/ByY2lKkgNs_/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link Are we trading for Kevin Love!? Meyers, Turner, 25 and a future 2nd for Love Cleveland desperately lacks long term draft capital They traded it all during the LeBron Return Or Meyers and Harkless maybe We would have to start Zach then but we wouldnt have to rely on him a ton offensively which would be nice https://twitter.com/zackfox/status/1136720792153206784?s=21 Also wentz getting paid off of what, 12 good games? Over 3 years The Jags only need Foles for weeks 17-20 Thats when he becomes the GOAT Hell yeah brother Oh damn my Blues are in trouble https://twitter.com/chocdelight1980/status/1136800416186941440?s=21 Oh wow nice Its raining in Portland so I have no choice but to listen to future all day His new LP dropped today France just had the sickest goal taken away by VAR I mean sure but barely And it was gonna be a blowout anyway lol The goal that was scored 3 minutes later was lame by comparison Im in this for me Not for equality Also I very much want to bet on France to win it all Damn thats great odds Klay is more important to GAW than CJ is to Portland Im drunk But I regret nothing Trade CJ for AD 2020!!!!!! Guys we can get GSW next year We can beat anybody honestly We just need to keep the core And trade the expirings in The core is Dame and CJ Anybody else Can go CJ is only on the table for AD I wouldnt do Jimmy Ive never seen Jimmy get 40 on the road in a must win situation And I know he cant do it All out for AD baby Dame, AD and Nurk New Twin towers Yea but no way we trade one of them for him I vote we wait and save the assets to the end But if we can get love for whatever I want to do that ?????? ???????????? Masai is the black panther https://twitter.com/erik_gundersen/status/1137167577271025664?s=21 Kawhi is going to mind fuck us all Hes gonna go to the clippers And Durant to the Knicks We are now in the player happiness era Titles no longer matter Kawhi and KD and Kyrie are going wherever they want Sorry to break it to you But it works for us because Portland is one of the best places in the NBA to settle We can get Love Or any overpaid star For expirings that come up this year Also my raps in 5 call from Thursday looking pretty good What about Simons? And Zach Lowe has written about Zach being the potential star we could have Thats already in the fold I think he was borderline but he never made it Cousins Like back then? Well kind of They still have the front court/backcourt Which makes it harder for centers I dont know who this person is https://twitter.com/ballthen/status/1137914114984955906?s=21 But this thread is interesting Honestly nah And thats just me being sentimental KD back Hes been getting dragged by the Warriors media lately I bet that plays some part I heard from someone at Wieden they shelved a KD ad because of the injury I think this is over even if kd scores 30 Which is honestly my ideal scenario The warriors getting their shit kicked tonight is the best chance for a warriors break up Klay tho He did follow all their young players and LeBrons wife over the weekend ?????? Klay would be a good clipper too lmao Remember Jerry west insisted the warriors keep Klay instead of trade him for Kevin love Also, Klay loves burgerville Klay and Harden would be filthy https://twitter.com/hoopsanalysis/status/1136749136345214976?s=21 Vince Carter in the building for the raptors https://twitter.com/timbontemps/status/1138224740261400576?s=21 I came out of bovada retirement to bet raptors tonight ? Marc Gasol saving the center position KD with the defense tho Sheesh Yup Fuck man Im really hoping its not Fuck https://twitter.com/cassidyhubbarth/status/1138278446264700928?s=21 Kyle Lowry legacy game Steph and Klay are ballin 9-20 from 3 BOARD MAN Norm Powell or Jordan idk?!? Jesus Christ No Durant is huge He was still efficient AF Tonight https://twitter.com/scottstrazzante/status/1138293172080193536?s=21 Shams says Achilles Wow Its on NBATV right now Holy shit This is the most emotional press conference Ive ever seen I wonder if this night still broke the warriors No its just wild lmao Also Durants Achilles Still insane There was some media pressure Questioning whether if anybody else had sat out so long if they would be back by now? https://theathletic.com/1017348/2019/06/08/kawakami-exactly-when-the-warriors-need-kevin-durant-the-most-nobody-seems-to-know-exactly-whats-happening/ I think it was more media than the warriors Has anybody seen detective pikachu Good? Good high movie? Hell yeah Thats rad Im trying to go and get high af before ? AD to Portland confirmed Its a great day to trade for Anthony Davis! Who says no! ? They get off batum 2 years early Evan and Moe expire 2020 So they get out of Batum a year early Batum has a player option in 20-2021 worth 27 million hes definitely picking up So trading Batum lets them pursue a free agent in 2020 Blazers twitter saying its a bad trade for Portland lmao Also Woj hasnt mentioned Portland once, which makes me think Neil is working I hope the former Because Portland deals just happen Whens the last time Portland made a deal that was speculated about? Or even had a rumor All the speculative ones never happen At least for Portland Its an exchange man. Neil gives Woj dirt on other teams so that Woj keeps his players names out of rumors until the last minute Its why Neil doesnt deal with anybody else And boxes us in the local media out Julius Randle off the bench Sheesh When Nurkic gets healthy tho >>>> Wow wow wow Man when Dame has to miss a few games like he does every year and we have Anfernee-Anthony pick and rolls??!????? He fits best with LeBron out of the youngsters on offense He just floats and cuts, doesnt need plays run for him But if thats what keeps them from getting AD??? Lmaooo I respect the lakers for trying God I need this AD trade done Jalen running shit Not Maria Taylor Wow Masoli didnt die to be compared to Darren Thomas He was the Ken Dorsey of Oregon football He sucked overall but he was a legend for us Thank the fucking lord Im just learning about him right now Hes 6-11 tho Could be a player in the Blazers range Minnesota is my favorite Potential destination For D-Li Lo I think they have to trade Teague or something To create room Unless its a bro trip I dont think so We all have Twitter I could totally see the draft being a good time This is insane Nurkic is better Chris Webber!!!! The Dynasty Slayer!!!!! Kawhi Leonard! Miami Heat (RIP), Golden State Warriors (RIP) Neither did the Warriors everytime! The NBA is a war of attrition I didnt but I came up tonight My red isnt so red Hubie voted Fred Van Vleet for MVP I love Hubie https://twitter.com/herring_nba/status/1139384932197814273?s=21 Appletime, Apple time Dog that Nike guy who stepped in between Masai and the cops is a brave man lmao Dallas and NOLA lmao please https://twitter.com/jawnbrown/status/1139543405543985152?s=21 Honestly its better for us Dame keeps the chip on his shoulder that way Neil go get Kevin Love Its time Idk whats in it for philly lol Cavs have no draft capital Ok fair enough They definitely pay them to work games Also the cop clearly made a mistake and is just doubling down in a really dumb way Like just let it go He also lied about Masai not having a credential he was carrying it in his right hand lol Somehow, no Even tho Lonzo covered his tat And is very nakedly trying to get a Nike deal If the Bulls replace LaVine with Lonzo Im jumping on the Bulls Bandwagon Copa America is poppin on espn plus I think its Kemba He already said hed do less than the super max Yeah good on pelinka for keeping kuzma I think its for cap reasons Also extensions unless they are supermax Are worse for the players usually Could be playoff That team is gonna play elite defense on day q 1 Making fun of the pelicans lmao I think anyway Thats the shirt AD wire Wore ?

Do we love the Morris brothers that much?!? Hes worse at offense Better at defense Pass Although that would mean Rachel DeMita comes to more games so Im for that GRANT Thats my big board I want grant Williams Good defender, strong, accomplished scorer in college Im just afraid hes gone before 25 Im also afraid if he is Neil is gonna ignore fit and pick another guard Yeah I mean I think the consensus on this draft is there are more good forward and centers than guards in this years class Grant is like the ideal fit and hes likely the BPA at 25 Ty Jerome is a shooter right? Sign me up Sports illustrated also said we are trying to buy into the 2nd round Ive also heard he had terrible interviews Lotta questions about whether he loves the game enough But a lot of people say he could be a top 5 guy in the class when its all said and done https://twitter.com/foreskingawd/status/1141490641093873664?s=12 Fab Melo RIP Only reddit lmao Sports illustrated mock this morning has us taking KZ Okpala https://twitter.com/bescrappydoo/status/1141081827605536769?s=21 When we have 3 blazers on Team USA at the World Championships >>>> Think positive!!!

GSW has to trade Iguodala or Draymond now too If they make that Russell deal Oh boy Ian the Miami deal might be falling through https://twitter.com/thesteinline/status/1145532434865426433?s=21 No I think just iggy to another team Dont think it has to be to GSW https://twitter.com/shamscharania/status/1145533354730766338?s=21 Not until December 15 The DLo trade has Nate Duncan big man and Im here for it https://twitter.com/nateduncannba/status/1145544623495897088?s=21 Speaking of backfires, this Jimmy Miami thing is in serious trouble The Mavericks were apparently confused about who they were getting And that part of the deal is now off Miami and Philly are scrambling to find a 3rd team with cap space to make it work Idk hes probably asleep and is going to wake up to this Dragic to Lakers May be their best plan B now If they miss on Kawhi https://twitter.com/dragonflyjonez/status/1145720816367210496?s=21 Zach is gonna start at the 4 Until we trade for Kevin Lets see if Kanter comes back for the minimum I would do that I would do Kanter more than JaVale The market is pretty dry now idk I guess the Lakers could pay him if they miss on Kawhi Which squad? Ours or cleveland? Cause we do need a 4 Right now Collins and Harkless are our 4s and neither really are 4s Whiteside??? This also means nurkic is not coming back Not this year anyway We matchup well with Philly and Milwaukee with both tho I would never hand my brand over to Kyrie my god Jimmy and Meyers are gonna bond over loving country music https://youtu.be/-vlltSehncc Im rock hard watching this Enes Kanter is just a guy being a dude LeBrons friend has gone too far lmao ? Kawhi is not doing it for Nipsey lmao I think it worked out for us We didnt give up any picks and got the 2nd best player in the deal That is not legit I literally woke up to write a news story on it cause Twitter suggested Kawhi to the Lakers too me and it was bullshit https://twitter.com/blakeyblake__/status/1145850674447450112?s=21 Thats the guy who pushed the Lakers-Kawhi done deal story lmao The division is gonna be ridiculous Our odds have barely changed for the title too I think we went from 33-1 to 30-1 I got us at 33-1 tho also the Lakers have made some smart moves too Jared Dudley and Troy Daniels for the minimum are good Shit RIP The Hefty lefty Jared lorenzen Jackson is a toxic asset to them apparently Please god Jalen be right https://twitter.com/danwolken/status/1146517061063118848?s=21 https://twitter.com/jwquick/status/1146480799757156352?s=21 Korver disappears in the playoffs tho And hes gonna be 38 this year Or 39 I think RIP in peace sweet prince Maybe? I feel like theyve earmarked backup PG for Simons tho I wouldnt expect more than a protected 2nd rounder Well we could get draft compensation still I think It just means they didnt have to send salary back to Portland to do the deal Rengel Im not sure on that I wish I knew how creating exceptions worked All the moves Portland made also took his PT Bazemore, Hezonja, Tolliver all would get more minutes I know how you can use it I just dont know how it gets created Yeah sagar is a kid lmao Thats the best way I can put it That guy is great at aggregating content but hes also a meltdown king online https://twitter.com/yuccimane/status/1146965556735512576?s=21 The medical stories about the porter family are so wild Like one of his sisters tore her ACL 5 times or something Lmaooo man dame cant be babysitting whiteside, Dwight and dame jr Never go full 2018 Lakers Removed an exclamation from Dwight would get side tracked with the huge selection of gay bars in Portland Im here for Dwight at CC Slaughters content Bring the PNW boy home He will if Kawhi stays Good morning!!! Damn Woj just reported presti almost traded Westbrook to Toronto https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1147490007831273472?s=21 It was PG and Russ for Siakam and Masai couldnt do it The 8th seed in the west added two stars, shit is gonna be so crazy Everyone was wrong I cant believe Kawhi convinced PG to request a trade That to me is the biggest move of all Quietest guy in the NBA just remaking the NBA in silence Shes a married Curry woman now, she traded up tbh Kawhi and PG is gonna be the most feared perimeter defense since Wade and Bron Toronto is a sneaky Wiggins candidate I like it Windy needs a break lmao God the Lakers are so washed outside of LeBron and AD I love it Also centers are back! God how awesome is it that Anfernee Simons is better than every guard on the Lakers Im not watching but his stats are good right now 8 points on 60% shooting https://twitter.com/meyersleonard11/status/1147643306978840576?s=21 ?????? I need to Julie Ertz to bicycle kick me in the face We just went up 1-0 Bovada is blocked in Italy smh The Dutch attack has put our defense in some bad spots so far Kevon Looney next https://twitter.com/brfootball/status/1147912186221613058?s=21 The worst social media graphic of all time Lmaooo what Its the cast of modern family Whiteside I think will have a Nurkic-esque boost when he comes to Portland Playing with guards who can shoot will be a difference maker Nurkic went from one of the least efficient centers to at least average and Hassan is super efficient already He led the NBA in boards one year National people are down on it But its a risk worth taking especially with only giving up Meyers and Moe He also has the same agent as CJ Kevin Durant changing his number ?????? Sad cause Kawhi stole all the headlines lmao Im no branding expert but that seems dumb Yeah thats why the Womens team is suing US Soccer Yeah I think they are also mad that FIFA doesnt really care about featuring the womens game. See: three continental finals on the same day as the Womens World Cup Final. It definitely cares more than it used to They had it on national TV here in Italy I mean doesnt the womens team generate more money? The highest rated games in Us history are all womens games and they just had the highest selling Nike jersey of all time Im talking specifically US Yeah but US soccer pays them and structures how the payouts go Right but it is The federation makes it that way If it was simple supply and demand the women would make more Than the Us men All the elite players who play in the USWL are paid by the national team not the league Yeah fifa cant get the sponsorship money as high but US could raise their salary is basically all I say too. I cant speak for the rest of the teams in the world that definitely generate less than their male counterparts Honestly we need ICE to start scouting footballers who dont speak English on the boarder Field Bucks, Lakers, Clippers, Sixers, Jazz, Nuggets, Warriors, Blazers, 76ers, Rockets are all teams I believe can win it all 1/3 of the league! Warriors got a shot if Klay comes back in February The blazers over under is gonna be mid 40s which gets me hard Im not sure it is unless its like top 20 protected Or like a couple of seconds He wont Theyll put Danny green on them Or kcp They also just got Avery Bradley https://twitter.com/barry/status/1148319099447119873?s=21 Or they keeping him on the shelf to make him part of a Westbrook trade Wiggins + Culver + 2 1sts https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1148339906285985792?s=21 At least the Heat with Russ and Jimmy would be fun I would entertain the Rockets just because its so crazy it just might work Why not? Basically keep PJ/Harden/CP and put everyone else on the table It would be kinda like Philly last year A team that doesnt fit at all but has so much talent it will fuck with teams Does this year of the NBA have more possible champions than the NFL? Serious q Just in sheer volume This is at least the closest its ever been Fair enough that makes sense Also 1 game playoffs creates more variance Thunder fans are going through it https://twitter.com/dillonyoung/status/1148374314779107330?s=21 Lots of rumors about Miami having interest Woj reported Miamis interest is real I would take them over Indiana and Boston for sure And Brooklyn this year They could be a top 4 seed https://twitter.com/bleacherreport/status/1148600026505056256?s=21 NOBODY IS DOING IT WITH DONUTS He got hurt vs Houston in Game 5 p sure He was healthy for the whole clippers series The Knicks have cornered the market on power forwards Smh Matty I feel like youre entering two phones territory All the photos and shit and posting Wait wait. How does going from Enes Kanter and Meyers Leonard to Hassan fucking Whiteside not help? Damn https://twitter.com/trailblazers/status/1149770460466307072?s=21 I guess so Glad to be back in America and winning money on bovada shout out djokovic I just caught up on Season 2 of BLL That show rules Do we want JR Smith if we cant get Korver? We know he can take and make shots in pressure moments Thats not a bad point lol Im gonna call navient and bet my remaining student debt on the Portland over That would also not be very profitable lol Selling every fire shoe for 40% off lol The Austerity 1s Yes, LeBron can do a lot but he cant fuck up that much inventory lmao His signature would also probably be potentially messed up Maybe? Ahh word Yeah fanatics is so much easier Lmaooo Also the same amount of divorces Hahaha I mean I was pissed he didnt share my story about the space jam 2 director change but we dont have to kill him Lmaooo Throw me a freaking bone here Holdahl Meyers is Ians problem now It was a take from last summer and it wasnt written by me lol I wont throw who wrote it under the bus cause it reflects on my editorial but come on Holdahl smh Did that year I interned for him mean NOTHING Clayton is just being a good friend after Holdahl and I had some back and forth on Twitter He tweeted a story about the space jam 2 director change and I tweeted at him saying he should have tweeted my story about the space jam 2 director change Lmaaoooo Quick says we are signing a center I hope its Joakim Noah Some people are saying Christian wood Cause he just got released Scratch that wood just got picked up By Detroit That color is dope ??????

So hes really 41 Im drunk But I also selfishly wanted to smoke with Joakim Noah And Pau definitely does not smoke Also what I hear from highkin about pau doesnt encourage me Hes lowkey very entitled Apparently I dont think Hezonja and Tolliver are bad defensively Theyre just not great Same with those guys, we cant turn the screws on the same way we used to But theyre OK Ive become an offense first guy outside of big men Shorter We need to photoshop a Portland Gear hat on him Cam if you tweet this I will RT The world needs it Its probably still loading cause I cant see it on your page yet What an incredible typo by Kendrick Perkins https://twitter.com/kendrickperkins/status/1154133146889281548?s=21 Mark Jackson getting Blacked due to Christianity Can confirm its real having flown delta out of pdx refently *recently Im no psychologist but that sounds like a manic episode Lmaoooo https://twitter.com/perma_ben/status/1154244482713489410?s=21 We were shrooming in Chiraq The Superliga is global!

I thought we had 14 before pau but I was wrong Yeah we already will have a lot of wings to potentially play if we include hezonja but JR would be good insurance Yeah but having a shooter cant hurt And hes not a bad defender I could also be down for Jeremy Lin Having that hardcore Asian support could be key come playoff time https://twitter.com/audhubillah/status/1155310859176091655?s=21 https://twitter.com/chold/status/1155907484583747584?s=21 This just reminded me that a spurs video coordinator spoke at the Mitchell Robinson camp and a kid asked him about LaMarcus coming back to Portland and the guys response was very matter of factly yeah he might Yeah Blazers arent good enough to say no to good players Already scouting burger week https://www.portlandmercury.com/events/26831189/grapeful-dead-bbq-burger Next week starting Aug. 5 The casuals are coming to our side PNW Passive Aggression is exceptional CJ extended! Id rather pay CJ that than give Jamal Murray 175 mil Its between us and Houston for the best backcourt until Klay is back Not having PG for potentially the first six weeks could hurt since Kawhi has to be load managed Doc will have them with homecourt at least But PG being out hurts their ceiling as a top 2 seed If we have two of the 30 best guys in the league at two top 20 prices thats good value to me https://twitter.com/actionnetworkhq/status/1156253488298504196?s=21 Kawhi is gonna be fine and the clippers will be too but the west is gonna be like the fucking SEC this year It could be like that year when the 48 win suns missed the playoffs OKC and Minnesota could be sneaky good Yeah and then Dallas is the hipster team Dame is global If Portland is in the top 3 by all star votes He could get in on the team success merit Also the playoff performance matters to coaches Who chose the reserves Derozan has fewer iconic playoff moments than CJ and like 5 all-star games Honestly the East was basically socialism for all-star bids Good choose Choice https://twitter.com/dru_star/status/1156616278213386245?s=21 Philly Twitter vs Heat twitter has been the nba twitter beef of the summer I mean I would rather have JR but I think a lot of it is hes a legend And the tweeter thing is an interesting question.

Having an All-Star big would make their development a lot easier Yeah I think the Spurs wouldnt be mad to get Zach Collins or something for LA either Fits with their age curve better Then I think its a good trade for us tbh if we dont give up any additional draft capital. The window is now. I would do it lol Dallas?!? Also its just one projection model Is Hassan and ZC the kitchen sink? Honestly I feel like believing too much in youth is the new market inefficiency Young players are overvalued in the league now IMO How about guys who can get buckets? I vote for that philosophy LA and Nurk would be erotic LaMarcus doesnt call Klay Thompson a hoe but hes better at basketball by a lot lol But Neil probably wouldnt do it I see the argument I just would roll the dice now rather than wait Yeah either way that RPM projection is ass Dallas is not a playoff team. But RPM never likes the blazers I wish ESPN let KP use the model he created But hes a company man so hes gotta do RPM lol Yeah computers cant handle the West ??

They were deleting comments on the story that called out the writer for basically taking Chinas side It has been in a bunch of think pieces. I didnt even know until this week the NBA has a camp in Xinjiang (the Uighur majority region) This is actually really good https://stratechery.com/2019/the-china-cultural-clash/ https://twitter.com/worldwidewob/status/1181726630986821633?s=21 Ben Simmons has done it!

I love seeing Denver media crown the nuggets tonight Warms my heart I hate the Cardinals so Im pro Braves Time to pound the braves Just put a little taste on Braves +600 Lmao Jess Jesus This is like Germany/Brazil 2014 Yeah well we have a ton of expiring But those might just have to let them expire and might not be able to cash it in for another expensive player now Im not woke enough to buy tickets for that unfortunately Yeah I bet thats an expensive ticket here lol Wow this is amazing https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/10/business/china-blows-whistle-on-nationalist-protests-against-the-nba.html China overplayed their hand and they are trying to walk back the anti-nba rhetoric lol Someone tweeted China is making their people watch shitty pro ball to own the libs Connecticut Sun +7 tonight in deciding game of WNBA Finals Courtney Williams is my new favorite womens player, such a G Dude idk I would bet the 17.5 the Pats are gonna cover that ?This Blazers playoff probability is all I need to know about this new 538 metric 32 compared to 68 for OKC ?Seems legit! I hope the new Oregon lottery sports betting app takes over under bets on the blazers Although the line might be different in Oregon Well if anyone is in Vegas bet on the blazers for me there lol Yeah but that must mean other lines will be similarly affected by regional biases Which is a potentially exploitable phenomenon They can use the betting data No they can just mine your betting patterns You have to have an account right? Does he accept BTC Ok Good to know Lmao seems like mark is already this guy Damn my Sun missed the cover Damn Ian too bad you arent in Detroit today https://twitter.com/jledwardsiii/status/1182681974009421825?s=21 https://twitter.com/atolliver44/status/1182803610138116097?s=21 ?Where were you, when all the dogs needed help? Legendarily dumb Omg come on cocks Thats great Goddamnit Never trust college kickers Any Superliga bros around tonight wanna watch the Blazers preseason game? Im going to the rose garden to pick up something but Im not going to stay at the game Ok well Id be down to watch beavs too but alas Im also trying to watch baseball Skal is getting first quarter minutes tonight lol Kyle Allen legend in the making Like 10 bucks also like 40 percent of my fantasy lineup is Carolina DJ Moore, CMC and the Defense I also have Carolina -2 and have them in a 5 team ML parlay So wild that Eliud did it yesterday Oh god Hahaha Wow Matt Powell has never run 8 miles in his life telling us about what counts as a marathon smh Yeah I saw she won gold again, dominant CMC! MVP Jameis just had back to back fumbles lol Wow they just had a fair catch free kick field goal at the end of the half Ive literally never seen that before lol no its actual football it just never happens I dont trust that line I dont trust minshew as a favorite Oh Ian I know thats the line Im just not wagering on that game I just jumped on the Texans and Eagles lines live baby Texans at +9.5 and Eagles +13.5 Texans baby!!! Christian McCaffrey would like a word God I hate to sound like a football coach but hes not just a running back, hes a football player Like they line him up everywhere and it just discombobulates defenses Yeah but not everybody who lines up in the slot is as sick as CMC I put 2 bucks on Fitzmagic money line Lets goooooo Wow what an ass throw by Jimmy G gave Kittle absolutely no shot David Johnson washed? This Edmonds guy is feasting Washed TD! Wow 62 yarder Oh wow Mariota benched Yeah this feels v v Joey esque Except he never had a Calvin Johnson Ahhh my b I thought they overlapped Matty Ice is actually sick no way Also with those sticky gloves I just watched the succession finale I also watched El Camino yesterday but I will refrain from speaking on that as well other than saying if you love Breaking Bad then what the fuck you gotta watch it HOF talk??? Stephen As response to John Oliver : bring back the baby filter https://twitter.com/stephenasmith/status/1183746505615822849?s=21 Yeah shout out to all of the media companies who fired their staffs for the pivot to Facebook video we all told them was bullshit Yeah unfortunately every media company made the same decision regarding Facebook because they believed the metrics Only people that suffered were actual journalists Now that we live in a post 2016 world we realize that but I dont think people were as suspicious as they should have been before At least the bosses werent I also dont know who the fuck counts them! One time we were told we had like 1 billion impressions on something and I was like...thats possible??? ?So in sum: technology, what is it? https://twitter.com/TheSteinLine/status/1183892549175521281 Dubov I guess we could! We can all draft on our phones Yeah Im fine doing it at the crib God Bron what a dumbass Good news tho! LeBron wire traffic ?????? I will post a Chairman Bron post Wow LeBron tweeting through it https://twitter.com/eneskanter/status/1183938681817698304?s=21 Wow I cant believe they lost Ive been in the blog bunker for the last hour I wasnt even watching Nobody blows leads like the lions Oh twitter has been dragging Bron for 12 hours So many believe in something, not unless it hurts China sales Wow I just saw a cursed twitter bio: Beavers and Lakers Rich Paul providing Klutch cover by bringing on a Muslim amid this China shit ?? Its the analytics take that an RB cant win Or shouldnt Because they dont touch the ball every play I dont really agree with the reasoning tho because some touches are more valuable than others IMHO Fair I just do think CMC IS different than RBs who lineup outwide And just his presence creates a ton of gravity for the other Carolina weapons to get open on Ive been watching TONS of panthers lol Kyle Allen is just Game managing EVERYTHING is CMC Like Im more talking eye test than pure yards. I get Russell will get more votes The backup QB angle also enhances CMCs case Oh I mean I hate HP So im glad KD told him hes a nerd Yeah Im very pro having principles of what is a good shot but If you can step into an open midrange shot then you should take it Hahahaha Also all the best scorers shoot in the midrange anyway cause good defenses dont give them easy layups or 3s Or like, floaters Like the Tony Parker floater is a legendary move Like shooting from there is technically analytically bad Yeah Im worried about the post game Big guys arent dying but the post game is Guys also like, dont work on their post game anymore either. Not very many good post guys anymore when there used to be so many Im down with eliminating the corner 3 If you have less 3 point surface area you cant juice the spacing like you can now It also ruined NBA 2K Every midrange jumper is a brick lol Im gonna work on this today for my annual column ?? Cause Dame already bent over backwards to bring him and he turned us down Twice ? Lmao no some guy on twitter followed me with this Avi and my buddy Seth is firmly on the LaMelo Hype train so I sent it to him We are a WEST COAST league 30 bucks per person Clay Draft will be decided at 7 PM I cant do anything about it ? I dont believe so Its only 4 years old I think I also dont love their pieces that much I also dont love their pieces that much - a statement I just made to someone about Dallas in another chat and brought in here Damn that sucks The China thing is still getting sorted but I think what happens is the league as a whole remains mostly unaffected while the Rockets business side gets fuckrd *fucked tencent is already back to streaming nba preseason minus Rockets God that sucks I would go Harden too And LeBron, he might average a career high in assists this year I think Jim Harden is gonna get a major energy boost from Westbrook But dame has as good a shot as any Im out on Jokic this season maybe Im overvaluing FIBA but he looked bad He looked slower on defense Luis Scola was COOKING Jok God how great would that be with the China narrative tho Ooooh Damn Im gonna have to place a wager on that Anfernee Simons 6MOY?? I think Skal is in the rotation cause Pau isnt cleared And we are gonna play two traditional bigs a ton Starting 4 Yup Apparently they bullied the Jazz last night but preseason etc Dude hes also fresh off the NBAs version of a depressive episode. He cant wait to play meaningful ball again Yeah I also heard that ET was mentally checked out last year Shout out to him for Game 7 but he was fed up with Terry Yeah dude! Back to back tho Ant will def probably play Yeah I would assume Dame, CJ and Whiteside are all sitting We wont know until later God Denver really doesnt give a fuck about the nba lmao I know its preseason but 3 bucks lol Boys how do we like the line tonight Feels like the public is a little too down on the Chiefs -3 I already bet I need a Simons This is like getting a young Neymar jersey Santos Neymar Idk if you guys are up on The Curse of RyCole but this is bad news for Zion and the Pelicans https://twitter.com/justrycole/status/1184966007565144065?s=12 The message boards are saying torn MCL Woj said its not your typical knee soreness which sucks Yeah it would be, NBA bet big on Zion, he has a ton of national games https://twitter.com/MasonGinsberg/status/1184958645991301121 #PointForward #PositionalRevolution Removed an exclamation from Its a real possibility that hes been completely misused his entire career I was just on a flight for from seattle to San Diego and was wearing Ducks gear and there was 0 Washington gear in sight Theyre scared Yeah one day I would love to do the Sailgating at a Oregon-UDub Not gonna lie Russillo needs to chill on the Kevin McHale talk I couldnt believe it lmao Zach Collins is like Kevin McHale if he only posts up on guys shorter than him not named marcus smart Sidebar: Im going to Mexico and Im drunk And bigger than most of the 4s in the league these days too Portland is bringing back the two-big look Whats his offish Brock? Wow! Its a human interest story not news lmao ?LFG Surgical Ian, Nasir had some great moments in our first preseason game against Michael Porter but hes been dealing with an ankle since then basically FUCK I was so fucking pissed on that 3rd down tackle before the TD Dude gained like two extra yards that shouldnt have been there Troy Dye bleeding a lot apparently but hes a tough MF ? Im fucking upset with Justin My guy is trying too hard to put NFL films on tape, just take what the defense gives you I just did. Harrowing and somehow heartwarming at the same time Lets fucking go!!! Also sounds like hes the favorite to replace Don Essig. Sorry, Rengel. His decision-making is legitimately subpar Talent is all there And low key a defensive school lol all of our best NFL alums are exclusively defensive players lol Josh Allen (white) prob Hes not afraid of running Marios clock management is Andy Reid esque Jesus Christ Habibi! Lets go!!!! Hes our https://twitter.com/fat_mac34/status/1185709906634014720?s=21 Thats what we like!!! I heard your plan and my Dads plan was better. https://twitter.com/bytimreynolds/status/1185762565101670400?s=21 Experience in the space you mean professional writers my man? Bovada doesnt work in Mexico but I put in a couple of parlays before leaving. ?? Im all in on dogs for one parlay. Gonna be a big day Raiders might make the playoffs its wild I think its fair to say the trade was dumb but mayock nailed the draft picks I mean, hes like their entire offense bro I dont think its that bad lol Wow cardinals fucking Matt Patricia taking away goal line touches from Kerryon ?????? Omg lmaoooo Ugh I hate that hes on the Jazz so much I just put it out there https://twitter.com/erik_gundersen/status/1186318538560065536?s=21 Guard play! I dont know how exactly to quantify it but I do think the Clippers snuck up on people last year. Everyone is circling that game on the calendar now, thats a different animal IMO That was an oversight I thought about when I went into town but I cant change it back now lma Chicago will be good tho I feel strongly about that Good enough for playoffs at least Lauri and Wendell are fucking sick and Otto porter is mad underrated I HATED Atlantas offseason tbh Giving up hella picks for DeAndre hunter, trading Tauren prince for Allen Crabbe, maybe Cam Reddish will be sick in addition to Trae Yall would trade Zach for Sabonis eighth Right? Yeah I would too but I dont think neils ego will let him I love the energy Chad! So we getting 3 all stars? Cant forget soon to be first time All-Star CJ McCollum! It will placate China by giving them a Li-Ning athlete Wow Well we can throw that trade out. He cant be traded for 6 months after signing a rookie extension Fuck man! I knew this was bad Goddamnit Brother Clifford just FaceTimed me from Spain #VDB Yes! Him and his girl were fucking lit lmao Blazers fans are believing. My tweet has gone crazy today lmao Im so hyped for Wednesday Yeah we getting old lmao I remember watching us pick Dame in Eugene It might be the most petty tweet Ive ever seen Brock Eating popcorn while you see Zion get injured lmao I also heard that r/adamsilverfanpage has replaced r/nbastreams but have yet to confirm it for myself Shes like the only person that I dont know or have never met To placate their Chinese owners? We at the blazers really love Tiktok but we really love the fact its owned by our Chinese friends Im dying bro MJ is so petty lmao https://twitter.com/stadium/status/1186490242817282048?s=21 I think ESPN is about to drop that massive MJ documentary soon Its gonna be like the OJ doc kinda from what Ive read. More a mini-series than a doc Yeah 2020 But thats not that far now Quick said the guys didnt wanna do it with HBO They wanna do their own movie where they have creative control So its probably never happening lol Oh baby I just set my lineups Im loving this. I have Sanu on my fantasy team and his value just went up Lmao the Blazers social media team is getting dragged by Black twitter for being NBA social so white Oh yeah its all happening I talked to one of the guys in it and they didnt even wanna do it They lost one of their black PR people this summer who may have been like uhh lets wait a sec *their only black PR person I feel like every higher up I ever met at Nike was a white European/argentine/Aussie/South African Lol Except for like, sports marketing guys who are almost all black I feel like WK is also very good about that I love how Utah and Denver are just both unimpeachable teams according to the basketball intelligentsia. I dont get it You guys saw that at least one NBA GM (and it cant be Olshey) picked Portland to win it all? Brazil China and USA? Lmaooooo What is Estonia nice at? Where is Marius Puninowski from? Pujinowski* Thats the only worlds strongest man I know God I love NBA opening day for bringing us a Petteri Koponen reference Have any of yall scene The Foreigner with Jackie Chan? I just watched it last night was reminded how much I love Jackie Chan. God I dont even wanna think about that. Way too many than am comfortable with probably I fucking love the West Its honestly going to be NFL-levels of competitive every night Perhaps, but the ECF itself may be a draining battle unto itself Those teams are elite Thats why I disagree with the notion anybody in the West can do load management without consequences Portland wont load manage That matters Dude I think Jokic is a real candidate He was spent in China Nobody said the clippers were dorks my god They are the betting favorites It is not a hot take to think they are good Lets see how they do against a team with real guards Pat Bevs intimidation tactics dont work against elite guards Looking forward to seeing Jamal Murray disembowel Jim Him And I dont even like Jamal Murray Its the content Toronto SUPER OVET OVER Our queen believes https://twitter.com/taylorrooks/status/1186889130816356352?s=21 We have me, Chad and Taylor believing in the Blazers. IMAGINE betting against us Wow their depth is bad beyond that Great take, v useful https://twitter.com/cheftrillie/status/1186995896006987776?s=21 For Ian Not to mention the players lmao What a lame choice Yeah I think Im gonna go to YTTV too since they have NBCSNW And Comcast doesnt have league pass this year lol Oh shit Yeah seriously, hopefully its something light like a death in the family Theres not a lot of great potential options here! Either way that sucks Time to start Tyler Herro in DFS Removed a heart from Yeah seriously, hopefully its something light like a death in the family Lotta people joking hes too sleep deprived lmao Ooh reading some not very reputable websites saying hes having a kid tonight Stand down After Pat Riley lost LeBron for telling people he was having a daughter, I dont think the heat are gonna reveal that info on Jimmys behalf My bulls need to pick it up Jokic burn out is real You heard it from me first Man did not manage his load this summer ?????? Its only his job to be in shape Deep is a good word for a lot of nobodies and an out of shape best player Anfernee is deferring too much Baze is ballin on defense Good news: Whiteside has been good! Hes been flat out better than Jokic tonight Bad news: we are losing! Lmao Im listening to music what are the comps, aside from Kevin McHale of course Murray is hurt and Jokic has been ass we better win Hell yes Ant! Attack! So guys The Michael Porter Junior hype Pretty weak! You gotta smoke weed to believe in the blazers Everyone knows this They just got RUN by the fighting Robert Sarvers tonight Maybe if hit 3s we will win Just saying its tough to win in 2019 shooting 25 percent on 3s Glad you guys beat up on the worst team in the West! Congrats! The Grizzlies, according to my own friend who works for the Grizzles, are the worst team in the West. M Maybe in the NBA You best Ja Morant and Mississippi Valley Comminity College *Community They played a good team, shot poorly and lost Welcome to the West Youre question is disengenois *disingenous Youre only concern trolling Yes it is Youre faux worried about what this means for Simons and trying to gaslight the group. We good tho. You are not asking us to apply it equally Ehh, it could also be you got so excited when guy played well but arent upset with him when he shot poorly? Hypocrite much?? Its a combo Im just saying, you are phrasing things out of a concern we arent being honest And its complete horse shit Youre the one telling us we have to be mad At simons For one bad game When you say which one is it isnt that what you mean? Ok I thought you were telling us to ship Simons off to China Because he had 5 pints Lol I just felt my son Anfernee was targeted and I couldnt stand for it Sorry for being agro *group hug* WE LOVE YOU GOD https://youtu.be/RQ8nytXs13U Do you hate Lauren Duca for making a career out of gaslighting? Me too. The Heat are 1-0 without their best player Ian wins the chat for the day But the line has been drawn on slandering Penny Simons Even perceived slander He was good until two bad close outs in the 4th and Jokic making shots on him Jokic couldnt drive on him at all but hit two big 3s That was kinda the change in the game Hassan legit played well and was making the extra pass on offense too Probably woulda had a few assists if we coulda made any shots Hes not the reason we lost, we can def say that Bazemore was awful offensively I dont wanna see Tolliver Im more than 45 games tho *in Hes a specialist, not an every game player Hawks are the NBA hipster darlings The hype machine loves them Luke Kennard ha; 30 tonight! *had Im bummed about Indy, I thought theyd be better tonight Indianas bench made Portlands look good I think they are still a year away from being in the playoffs Atlanta Warriors-Clippers tomorrow should be sick Oh wow I didnt even see we get Giannis vs. Harden tomorrow too MVP showdown I prob wont see the game but Ill def look forward to the highlights I honestly hate how you guys find rando wings who arent terrible on offense and play good defense Its like, the most mind-boggling heat thing Yeah thats fair God I cant wait to get back on American internet and gamble again What if the Warriors are also bad? I didnt see the game lol Was Steph flustered? Yeah I dont think they should trade for Iguodala The clippers dont need him Honestly WE should trade for Iggy I think Baze will truthfully shoot better And Tolliver. They are both above average career shooters They just missed everything in Game 1 I mean Baze works right? Im just saying we should consider that option If Baze struggles ?*loses internet for 2 hours* iCloud in Mexico is different I guess ? Also Jimmy Butlers baby mama is allegedly KATs Ex No wonder the wolves didnt work out Wow Thats wild Or I guess, not wild Lol Im legit blown away that a hazelnut is a bush Im about to catch the second half on the plane Hope the Zers bring it tonight Fuck the Waltons! Traitors! Damn Porzingis gotta get on the squat rack. Absolutely getting beasted by Jrue LUKA! I love this song Feeling good about my Toronto over You guys is Phoenix...not terrible? 
P Hows Hassan looking tonight boys Fuck yeah Just gotta close out this 4th Ian is truly the only Heat fan I know that believes in Whiteside the Heat Twitter Whiteside slander is out of control Jazz-Lakers is currently setting the game back 25 years https://twitter.com/chold/status/1187945884484419584?s=21 Wow John stays a legend Good times Im glad swanigan got funding for his mumble rap career God now its time to watch our bitter rivals Utah and the Lakers play awful basketball What if the Mike Conley drop off is this year? Hes 32 Chad no lie everytime I watch him thats what I think about Shes from Oakland but she went to UP https://twitter.com/ayethatshootie/status/1187951948831563776?s=21 Damn boys we got a meeting Luka and dem boys in Dallas on Sunday ESPECIALLY the Auburn one Finally watching the blazers. Love Terry rewarding Hassan for his grunt work in the first half by starting the 2nd half by running a play to get him a deep post touch Woah I didnt even know that Yeah Id say so lol Or is Justise the PG? Do positions matter? Also Tolliver my god. You are not prime Ryan Anderson Hes shooting it the second he catches it! He also made some not very veteran mistakes on defense. Maybe hes just nervous trying to make his mark on the team but I expected more savvy from him Chad my ultimate homer hope is that Nassir takes Tollivers spot Hezonja has also been butt He might need to brush up on his Chinese Christian Pulisic hat trick! I didnt see the game really Ian but I am looking forward to watching Milwaukee today I also wanna watch RJ Barrett today Im looking forward to seeing Houston tonight but Im bummed out Jrue holiday is hurt for that game The best ability is availability! Westbrook will show up to work more nights than CP3 Dont do this to me Jason its too early for this! ? Ok auburn! Their running back is a load On a serious note I was considering Miami +11.5 Thinking about parlaying all the dogs tonight in nba ? Bo Nix is a gamer baby Im hoping for some garbage time for Miami to cover 11.5 lol We got this cover baby! Yeah that shit was crazy lmaooooo I got nothing lmao My 5-team parlay is alive! Just threw down 20 bucks on Pelicans +9.5 live Ingram is taking the leap! Tell your Lakers friends! Muahahaha ?????? Whats it if you add the Panthers to that? 18-1? Woah Ill go 20 on Panthers +5 mark Love to see notre dame down 17-0 in the 3rd Lonzo and Hart have done a great job guarding him Hes a fucking monster Pascal is my leader OG also had 4 blocks tonight Same here mark Lets gooooooo Really hope that doesnt come back to bite us And also my bet Please god Score a fucking touchdown We got a Timeoit Just let Herbie make a play Thank god God I cant go to sleep now lmao Im fucking jacked after that Also Verdell with 300 total yards Also just gonna throw out that I love the Cardinals +12.5 at the saints NBA lock of the day Thunder +1 at home against golden state I would also bet that But OKC is like not bad And Golden state might be Ok kliff Kingsbury is officially a sick coach These plays the Cardinals are running are amazing Omg please tell me the Bucs scored And thats gonna stand Bullshit! D-Lo just got ejected for the warriors lmao Kyle Allen was only good because cam was basically disabled If cam is healthy hes better But the niners are just flat out sick ?????? ? Yeah I need Jaren to ball out But even then Im
Done hood is ballin I dont think Ive ever seen him get called for that lol Holy fuck That Wiggins run Lol What defense by CJ, Baze and Mario Wow DAME DOLLA I guess Wow The first big time challenge Helluva win! Tolliver is awful Hope Zach isnt too fucked I just saw a Dwight is theon tweet lol Oh fuck blazers play again tonight It has to be Mario Or the wild card nassir It absolutely positively cannot be tollive Tolliver Yes The Noah Vonleh Memoroal Young Guy Vanity Start Memorial* Actually we are totally missing it Skal is totally gonna start I want nassir But Skal is probably what terry will go with Putting nas on LaMarcus would be a tough ask For a first start Oh word? I thought theyd been starting Poeltl Oh yeah then we should totally start Nas! Fuck trey Lyles lol Oh god Im gonna save that tweet to trigger Denver when Gary Harris has a bad game Lol wow Chad doesnt it seem like Tolliver is like 0-20? Praise the lord hes only taken 4 field goal attempts Maybe this is a BBref typo It cant be real Lol Ok it is real Hes been awful We need to trade for Draymond Some NBA cap nerds are saying this warriors season would be perfect for the NBA to have a loan system like soccer lol Like imagine just getting to rent Draymond and make a run at a title For one year The flip side of course is then Steph would be on the Lakers lol https://twitter.com/dame_lillard/status/1188854106217222144?s=21 Idk it would be kinda cool for teams that are tanking to rent out their good players without losing them for good. But Im also saying that as someone who would love to rent Draymond while Nurkic heals lol And potentially if Zach is out long term Im sure Id get really mad when Philadelphia rents Steph or something Thank god teams only get 1 per game Even if they get it right Stotts has low key killed it with the challenges. Got a foul on Zach taken off with it against Sac Im anti-replay but if its gonna be used teams should be able to take advantage I think they did that with the automatic reviews But the coach challenges are still handled at the game Like foot on the line, out of bounds and stuff I dont know how the balls arent chipped yet Of all the things they track I was impressed we pulled it out Saturday without Troy dye Kinda wish Travis dye could transfer his health points to his brother Who is that! Nice https://twitter.com/realgm/status/1188921669311696896?s=21 Im LOVING the dialogue Also loving Phoenix at home +4.5 v Utah We are getting 6 at spurs No Zach is gonna hurt Idk how we survived last night ?5 teamer tonight Ugh just saw Gus Johnson is calling the Ducks game this weekend against usc Wow we are fucking Mario hit a 3! Skal with the board and putback dunk got me hard Hezonja stepback 3??!? Omg Simons the kid His defense is better than Moes More consistent More energy Yeah Im fucked on my bulls over lol For 1st? Haha hell yeah Looks like we are running out of gas Wow thats gnarly They are destroying deadspin https://twitter.com/barry/status/1189224064788979712?s=21 Shit man it would probably only take like 20 million at this point But again I dont have 20 million laying around Such trash man Omg The bench has been Westbrook lmao Hes been a monster And hes making free throws again They got bought by somebody and they just published yesterday their bosses told them to stick to sports which LOL if youve ever read deadspin There isnt one lol Lol god Deadspin created its own lane its just so wack man Wow the NCAA just said fuck it Let kids make money Go Ducks baby! Bronny James Oregon Ducks point guard!!! I mean, Deadspin hasnt been owned by deadspin for a long time. Univision owned them and sold them to whoever owns them now Because they probably think they make a bigger statement by telling their bosses trying to police editorial to fuck off But if they just get along with that then they cease being deadspin Deadspins tone is its value both as an idea and as a business https://twitter.com/sethpartnow/status/1189204179119673344?s=21 This is a 3-point chart. Right now our amount of open 3s allowed is below average but teams are also hitting at an above average rate against us I got NBATV with it But my old account didnt have it So if they have my old account logged in youre probably SOL lol But my new one should work with nbatv Tonight is the last night of the league pass free preview If it works tomorrow then start celebrating lol Also my fav nba bet tonight is Dallas +5 at Denver, nuggets playing 2nd of a home back to back I put a little taste on the ML as well, +180 Ugh Damn Hes been ballin It looked like a bad roll tho My immediate first thought was when Lonzo jacked up his ankle Hope its not a grade 2/3 strain *Sprain I just bet on Miami to cover lol Atlanta without Trae is a dumpster fire Live like was 9.5 Sage knowledge sounds so much cooler than life hack imo Nunn also might get cancelled soon lol I had no idea about this but he had some pretty messed up reasons for getting kicked out of Illinois Heat twitter made it a story today No thats in the ballpark I think I dont remember exactly Sounded like he water boarded his girlfriend tbh Water was some how involved We cashed in Heat -9.5 live tho Thats fantastic news Idk if it was water boarding but he like poured water on her or something Our bad! I dont remember and he was vetted by multiple teams. The warriors had him in camp Oh wow I thought he was just a camp guy And Zach Norvell and Talen Horton-Tucker Lol The Mavs are in great position for the ML upset Wow Matty I never saw that Pau and Magic had the same energy until now So wack Wow that sucks Makes me thankful for what we have here Also Maxi Kleber is just Meyers Leonard with an accent I tweeted my Meyers-Maxi Kleber take and draft Twitter is up in arms Im delighted Draft twitter being mad is a joy Hell yeah So bad ass how the Nats only win road games Lol Theyre only comfortable in a one game wild card scenario at all times Thats vintage MdotBrown lmao Hes very old and bitter Hes funny at times but mostly the latter I balled with him at Wieden once He really thinks hes Kevin Garnett on the court even tho he smells like a pack of marb reds His habits were a TE legend One of my favorite parts of this story is how Whitlock has a brand manifesto where he quoted himself ?????? Starting center!?! lol I think Tyler Herro will take all the businesses looking for a white heat I dont normally drink on Tuesday but deadspin has me indulging lol ?????? God Im blank lmao God Chad its taking everything in me not to dunk on that tweet but thats Malikas sister and Malika is a homie so Im not trying to do that lol Is it possible?

Mike Malone praising Mason Plumlees effort after Jokic got the business from Jahlil Okafor last night Im willing to consider! He apparently cured his sleep apnea ?????? Is it for...racism reasons??? ?????? Bro Matty thats my guy Ian we hung out with the guy on the left at Bonnaroo He was the shorter of the two guys we played football and BBQd with Totally ran into Chuck Klosterman at breakfast Didnt say hi to him but he looked at me for a really long time lol I should have said you know my buddy Clayton No he was with his wife and they were meeting people at Broder on the west side I should have told him Mayor Pete can SMDFTB Thats actually true Lol Time to call Steve Jail Jesus Christ he just doesnt have a clue ?The birthday parlay. Follow at your own financial risk Nope Lol I came up short on a 3 teamer last night cause I picked the spurs Parlay on the ropes I need the magic to close it from 20 to 4.5 lol Cant wait for DB to talk dirty to me about Dwight Howards roll game I cant wait for the fight tomorrow, its the Latino Super Bowl Anybody hear listened to Jesus is King? *here I hate Kanye but I also hate that I like the album I agree with that take The Ty DOLLA song is also a bange Banger He has a lot of good tracks on it IMO his raps arent good but the songs are good What a play by Jason Kidd (This is my narrative to create division within the Lakers) Nba concussion protocol getting exposed They talk about one lol Xenophobia Bron is special man And so is Luka Porzingis showed hes not that special to me tho Dwight was the 4th best player on the court LeBron-AD-Luka-Dwight JaVale is the vanity starter and Dwight plays more minutes lol Zingis also cant post up against smaller guys which is concerning Hes not a young Kevin McHale in that regard IMO Also dubov Im pretending until I wake up tomorrow back in reality But really hes not good at posting up smaller guys hes still good Just think going small would be more effective against him than Dallas wants it to be Im just hoping that they are trying to rehab whatever is going on without putting him under the knife But shoulders really are never the same no matter what you do So its basically up to him if he wants to play through it and wait until summer Bunky is the Horford stopper Thank the fucking lord hes suspended Eason is the new Foles Superliga transaction wire: picking up Fultz after he moved to the starting lineup I have 30 on the Ducks tonight Cant lose This is what Ed gets for switching sides You join the Jazz you pay the consequences Back breaker bitch! Lost money on Johnny walker but I got Phoenix and raptors tonight Shoughgun time Zach injury sucks but ultimately it doesnt hurt our ceiling Hassan is gonna be a Blazers legend He got clipped good The coward Ant is my son Wow Cant believe they didnt switch on that last possession Im not betting but Masividal is smart He knows when to engage Minshew inflation rate lol All the minshew Halloween costumes artificially juiced the line I put the Heat in a parlay already lol Did a 9 team NFL/NBA, 3 bucks to win 1,070 Lol Thank you for the support Dubov The Ducks and the Phoenix suns are supporting my habit of bad parlays God and Ayton is kind of a modern Ewing Both islanders with vanity muscles Yessir Ultimate flex Doing it on Sunday when chik fil a isnt open lol This campaign is huge with the goth kids Watching this Steelers-colts game cause Im without red zone and I just remembered when Mason Rudolph almost died this year Incredible how hes playing. Football! Im driving to MLK. The sandwich is calling The official chicken sandwich of the gays Twitter is gonna be all over that virtue signaling If you love injuries and back up QBs is Colts-Steelers the game for you I also have colts +1 in my parlay ? Yes For the game at least Colts gotta pound this drive on the ground ?????? ? Damn Would hate to see Luka in such Swaggerless Shoes Also heads up Packers are getting half a point live The Bucs are the biggest Jekyll and Hyde team in the league If they get LaMelo Im gonna be on suicide watch Thats just sickening Yeah we need to hope for a New Orleans scenario Or like someone like the Suns gets the top pick after barely missing the playoffs Anybody but the dubs lol ESPN is saying hes the best distributor/creator in the draft and maybe the most complete player Hes like 6-8 now And plays defense finally lol They gonna fire Freddie sandwiches for sure Ian RN https://twitter.com/kingjames/status/846163009638666240?s=21 I think theres a chance Lamar has the juice to beat them and Bill wont wanna show his strategy in regular season I already put them in a parlay so Im good lol https://twitter.com/blsdie/status/1191176124556087298?s=21 Brady definitely called Ed Reed the N word like hes done it before lmaoo LeBron with 13 assists to add to his league lead Also Dwight dominant again 21 minutes, 14 points, 12 boards and 2 blocks 7/7 from the field I love Bellichicks dirt bag son God the ravens just destroying If the clippers cover here I have a shot at getting my first big parlay provided the Cowboys cover against the giants God the browns fucking blow Sanu is so dope in the pats offense 14 targets lol ?????? The 76ers and the 49ers! Just a Cowboys cover away from winning a light 97 off a 4 dollar bet Cowboys -7 Thats some relatable ass shit Mark We can be more freely inappropriate Dude the Suns have the No. 3 net rating in the league right now Behind the Lakers and of course, the Miami Heat If they dont go 2-1 this week we can panic They have the Warriors tonight and then the Nets home on Friday with the Clippers sandwiches in between Yeah its actually Thursday it looks like So we have a Thursday-Friday back to back I would guess months chad If hes out for a long time They might be able to get some kind of exception We may get a chance to see Moses brown Yeah we do have one open spot I would take Joakim ? Honestly this is encouraging Weve had a pretty tough schedule so far and we are still above average efficiency Lmao they retired Boshs jersey in Miami hes done done Lmao I think even DLo is questionable Steph and dray are def both out, dame has a chance to get 50 Phoenix should also be in the top 10 Theyve been better than San Antonio Utah should be on the top 10 Shouldnt* https://twitter.com/flybyknite/status/1191412467017977856?s=21 Cross Joakim off the list We need Pau Gasol! What a world No but thats how the blazers roll Hes close He like just started doing basketball stuff He hasnt had any setbacks but they are just taking it super slow cause hes old Im working on Fridays game Im gonna try to work in some spanish to see if I can get some more info Havent had a good spanish speaking mole for me since the Luis Montero days I told yall Meyers would be good in Miami! Hes useful! Especially when his role is clearly defined It is wild theyve done this without Winslow Oh yeah they didnt even have him either Im keeping an eye on Pelicans-Nets as a potential live bet opp Also Washington against Detroit Suns are good and at home I dont know how to play that one even tho wagering on the Suns has been very profitable Suns are like, good man Monty Williams can coach me up Dipo was playing half court 5-on-5 the other day And I still need Winslow Who has barely played Yes I think Christmas is hopeful I believe so Thats why they were featured in Get Out Glad I hedged on the giants tonight Saving me from parlay devastation Also I just put a small taste on Pelicans +400 The Nets were built to blow this game with 18 minutes left The pelicans are now covering 6.5 already after being down 19 Lol Bring a lesbian! Whiteside is playing Just bet Portland -12 Ugh Comcast reporting Zach has a labrum year Tear Hes gonna be done for 6-8 months easy Makes me think it was fucked before it happened Its time for Terry to play Nas Yeah hes eligible this summer Yeah we are losing to the worst team in the west but how bout that pass by Gary Trent! I love Trent getting time even tho he has a little too much juice on that 3 God do we want like a 15 point deficit? Provided the giants dont score a td my 5 teamer is gonna cash Also I forget who recommended YouTube TV in here but it fucks I love Eric Paschall Lol He reminds me of a taller JR Rider without the issues Also League pass on YTTV works so much better than the NBAs native apps its insane Portland? Yes ? Yeah nobody needs to see one of these kids injure dame Man spread is 10.5 at half and Im tempted it to double down I already got them at -12 I think Dame is gonna cook And they are gonna end this Eric Paschall nonsense Also Devin Booker got MVP chants tonight ?????? I added a little bit more to my bet as well Cant wait to plan out like 4 8 team parlays this weekend God anybody aside from Dame would be welcome to hit shots He has 7 of our 11 points in the quarter Dame needs a 60 USG% down the stretch diff Idgaf Hes the only guy doing anything offensively Wow Whiteside man Lmao Hood really loves Dame holy fuck Nope *all season Yeah this is trash CJ, Whiteside, Baze have all sucked We dont have any bigs on our team Its wild The season hasnt started until the first blazers depressive episode Its real now But chad what if we beat the clippers Then youll be sad Thats only healthy John Collins caught juicing So at least hed be out if we drafted him too! Natural Nurk is disappointed ? Guys I have an idea for our last roster spot https://twitter.com/imanshumpert/status/1191746030703927297?s=21 Teayana Taylor coming to blazers games can save the season Oh yeah Yeah I mean Lebron is the obvious anomaly everyone thinks of when it comes to PEDs lol I def think its some kind of combination between drugs and the crazy balance/core work he does And obviously diet too Yes, I tried their stuff Its basically like dehydrated greens you put in a bottle Or protein powder They give you like a combination of powders I did it for a piece I never published The greens shit is literally just drinking dirt lol God the Chargers might move to London permanently Imagine being a scout for the Chargers, you probably would never even go to London It would just be impossible Cant wait for the first story of Melvin Ingram or something just becoming a part of London culture, drinking tea and shit I should be able to live in Paris AND play for the London Chargers Austin Ekeler https://www.instagram.com/p/B4fVC9QnK4W/?igshid=13w2bkgh9xylt Yeah bro Im taking the Heat The Nuggets have not been good Im super interested in the Lakers-Miami line That will probably be my first Heat game *fade Dubov as our college sports expert do you have any recommendations for tonights double header? Superliga Trends Nick Foles back baby! LFG Jags still have a shot at a wild card. They have the Colts twice but then a bunch of shit matchups: Titans, Chargers, Falcons and the Raiders too Lmaooo Im sure youll catch a quick block And perhaps the wrath of the NABJ task force, idk if you want that Four months is honestly encouraging I was thinking 6-8 Absolutely not Melo after he dissed us so many times lol Fuck that man Bazemores shooting has been disappointing At least Tolliver tries on defense Beating the clippers on the road would be a nice start Idk how that happens But it would be nice! And tbh classic blazers I mean they made a bet that Zach could fill in the Aminu role and the Meyers role Starting 4 and back up 5 And they are catching a brutal beat And Jody is willing to spend but wasnt willing to triple the tax bill to bring Aminu back is basically why hes not a blazer Aminu is in a great spot in Orlando as the 4th best forward on the team Prob woulda been hard for him to stay and accept a benching too I would love for them to see if anyone pops in the G League But 4 is probably the thinnest position in the league now Baze doesnt match? Fair but it would be nice if he could hit a fucking jumper I decided about 20 minutes ago I like Cleveland tonight They can def cover 6.5 at home I already bet Lol Future Portland Trail Blazer Tristan Thompson is averaging 17 and 11 Tristan and K-Love for Whiteside on Dec. 15 GIVE IT TO ME (We probably cant make the money work unless we trade nurk) LaMarcus is gonna be 35 next year I was way off last night and Ive had some tequila but Lakers down 15 at bulls is a tremendous live bet oop imo Lakers are +225 Im going in lol Listen if tonight is what spurs the bulls to hit the over then Im okay with it Cavs cover! Ian I just got my first taste of Eric reeds auctioneer ass voice Its finally NBA Even if the Lakers lose this i have a fire tweet drafted for blazers twitter so its truly a win win God fucking Luke Korver Kornet* Knicks cast off who I only know because of his presence in a major media market Time for Dwight, the NBAs plus-minus leaded, to bring us home *leader Hes easily the best backup I wouldnt say top 5 But maybe top 10 You only get November once Lake show!!! Lakers ML saving my bovada balance Ian whats the feel on the Heat Live bet? Hes progressively getting in worse shape but is somehow still good Hes the Jared Lorenzen of nba players Like him getting cooked by Luis Scola wasnt a fluke and yet it doesnt matter?!? Hoping they can rally to cover 5.5 Whatever the spread is against the Lakers Im taking the Lakers lol Guessing 6.5 Cant trust the Bucks on the road to cover Orlando +7.5 at Dallas tho I like very much I put 25 on the spread and 10 on the ML +265 is too tasty to pass up Clippers are still good even without kawhi They could win tbh Wow I love Philly getting points at Utah with Embiid back LOVE Also off their first loss Philly is gonna win that Womens Eurocup point shaving? ? Lol I have no fucking clue You let Darren Rovell report that Dont just give the info away lol Our Magic off to a solid start! God the magic bench is such ass Nevermind! I love Michael carter-williams! God so close to hitting the money line in Dallas Down by 1 and the magic take a 3 with the last shot Wtf man Aaron Gordon fouling himself out on back to back offensive fouls had to feel great for chad thin *tho Josh Richardson with the push at the buzzer for the sixers ?? Profitable night! Back to back baby! Damn just a bow square to the forehead You guys I think terry just got beat in the all time Erik has a weird exchange with an nba person Rich Paul shot me a DM to correct a LeBron Wire story today No hes good He actually gave me some info The Morris twins are just idiots lol Marcus just refused to listen to him Lost 26 million in the process and ended up on the Knicks lol Yeah Removed a like from Ill be in Japan so I cant watch Ian how are we feeling about the heat tonight Against the mighty suns So guys We are getting 5.5 Is tonight the CJ progression to the mean? I havent bet outright yet I took Portland but if Portland goes up big early Ill probably short them with a Clips live bet They still havent let me scan my ID They dont want my action lol My 5 dollar parlays Oh okay I thought I would get an email Shout out https://twitter.com/markg_medina/status/1192621115866091520?s=21 Doc is extremely sensitive Good cause I bet on their ML The first time ive faded the suns all year Baze Pull up 3! He lives! James Johnson looks like he went to prison to get his braids tightened and lose 15 pounds cause pat riley told him to Hezonja! stoning Kawhi on back to back possessions?!? I have to say guys I think dame is getting fed up with Whiteside Ive never seen him look at a dude then look away to another guy multiple times like he has with Hassan It is DIRE Unless he gets Montrezl to eat his ass in the 2nd half Im gonna be upset lol Degenerate optimism: +280 Yes and lazy Lol Blazers basketball lmao Classic Portland has oddly had great 1v1 defense on Kawhi The Whiteside cycle is upon us Or they throw up our tweets on the projector Also possible They coulda seen everyone tweeting then found the clip And put it on his iPad I would do it for sure Yes!!!! Bro His defense on Kawhi I dont know whats happening Hes turned the team around in the 2nd half We are praising his play This is how it works! Hezonja has turned Kawhi over 3 times And I dont think Kawhi has scored on him All time weird game The clippers guards cannot handle Ant Beverley is toast Simons is getting me fucking amped GUARD PLAY Its the one weakness of the West elite aside from houston and Utah Hadnt hit a 3 and was 6-15 before that shot, vintage Lou Its awful Whiteside showed why the trade was worth it tonight He just cant play half a game Yeah, golden state and Philly were worse but tonight just drives that home Kawhi had 18 in the 4th That was just Kawhi shit We honestly played pretty good D Just playing from behind killed them I wanna start Simons lol Fuck it Over Tolliver Just go 3 guards Lean into the identity It was a good closing look Ant played 26 He plays 32 Yeah thats a nice boost our defensive rating was 102.8 tonight which isnt even bad We shot below 30 percent from 3 again When shooting was supposed to be the biggest upgrade Shady terry lmao https://twitter.com/paolouggetti/status/1192687350570086400?s=21 Omg Terry is also super old school lol When it comes to minutes Its gonna be weird if Kawhis greatest legacy is getting the league to shorten the schedule Yes mostly Had a couple of 3s But mostly again was not good on offense Not feeling like much of an upgrade on that end Wade yes but not LeBron really Wade had no choice Bosh was also super durable ?? Lets get a blazers win for chad tonight ?????? Oh my god You guys we may have lost last night but Kawhi was 2-5 and had 3 turnovers against Hezonja last night So who really won? Omg that dude was our client when I worked at TE I never talked to him Obviously wow Apparently the warriors are denying that 3 months for a broken hand is excessive I was playing at the rec after like 6 weeks Smh #Loveofthegame Yeah that was brutal The NYT story Well Dubov theres a chance I will join you soon, I just did a writing test for NikeCourt Yes I would very stoked Wow James wiseman ineligible I thought the ncaa was done with this? His lawyers just announced it apparently Wow Oh my god Lmaooo thats fucking crazy Lololol God Fuck the NCAA lmao We all just wanna see wiseman hoop Now the ratings will be worse I just dont get it Protect the goat at all costs Removed a heart from a movie At least Gary Trent hit a 3 Nassir! Happy birthday Chad! Nassirs first nba Stat is a block on a 3 point attempt! Dame Jesus Christ 42 points with 3:46 left in the 3rd with no help at all 7:3 left 70 is not off the table Wow What a terrible loss lol CJ 4-19 Report from the Locker room: dame is patient but that patience is being tested Whiteside was also visibly uncomfortable after the game. Whole lower body covered in ice, definitely feeling the back to back and being the only center on the team No And no Nas was dope tonight Even ate into bazemores minutes Also saw Whiteside checking his phone so he could see the Heat score He still thinks about you Ian! Fair It was too good of a photo not to put on feed Im upset with how he met me down last year but hes still pretty sick at shooty hoops and seeing him live reaffirmed that *let me down Anfernee actually defended him well on the dagger, Kyrie just hit a Kyrie shot Dinwiddie outplayed him most of the game tho Hell yeah im about to go get some brewskis and make some chili tonight Yes! I always knew I liked PJ fleck! Weed isnt legal in Florida Is it? Possible he got some black market gummies? That were mixed with other shit The quote of his I posted was 1000 percent about Whiteside Whiteside is just not used to thinking of his impact outside of stats Or at least dame wants him to focus on different stats Wow thats some coastal elite shit You guys Its time to get weird Nas 2020 No Whiteside tomorrow is very likely Hes questionable Moses Brown is for real gonna play ?Beer is high cuisine LSUs receivers arent so intimidating Its like looking at 4 plaxico burress *are so intimidating Swear to god every pass play someone gets open SEC hasnt been smash moth for like 3 years? Its all spread Thats amazing Wish I had bet My parlay tonight is alive cause the Celtics beat spurs Even tho Gordon Hayward broke his hand Dude its so trash honestly gimme Jim Nantz, southern God, for SEC and gimme Gus for NFL Idc if Gus is at Fox its time The ladies will be begging to give a sucky sucky in Tokyo tonight its lit Boys we are within minutes of my 2nd 5 team parlay ?Im sending this to Jody to tell her to spend money Whats the difference between Professor McGonagal and Penny Hardaway really?

The Saints are the only pick holding me back right now in these parlays I thankfully kept them out of my 10 teamer But if they turn this around it might be a money morning BetOnline is one a lot of people use MyBookie is another My bookie is like legit off shore Some guy calls you to confirm Its not +295 but I jumped on that Bills ML at +130 ?Bovada right now I just jumped on Wolves moneyline against the Nuggets at 12:30 Wolves at home getting 3.5 Love that the blazers line on Oregon scoreboard is a half point higher than it is everywhere else Embiid yes, Simmons no Might be worth a shot Maybe they get hot All they do is shoot a ton of 3s and theyll be up for this game no doubt Go for it! Gambling! God seeing the Titans thrive with tannehill is depressing lol I really hope Mariota isnt toast Maybe it was the injuries that slowed him down too He was playing pretty well the year he broke his leg At least thats how I remember it Unfortunately the Titans didnt hire Greg Roman Or reunite with Helfrich In Chicago You guys I think I may have found a way to make the Oregon betting bias work in our favor The Lakers are somehow +350 for the title even tho most books have them at +300 Oh my god this is fucking gold Jesus Christ josh Allen get it together! Josh Allen (white)* Hes back! I need Mahomes to score a touchdown here to keep the 10 team parlay alive Bills are about to do the job Lmaoooooo What hands by the big man Goddamnit Tyree Tyreek Well guys the dream of 5 to win 1800 was fun At least it lasted until the 4th quarter of the morning games!

Yeah Our rebounding is disappointing We were supposed to be a power team Typically top ten on both sides on the glas Glass Not without a trade If we could get bogi and Bjelica from the kings that would be a nice move without it costing much Theyre not signing either one They already committed 180 million to Buddy and Barnes Its insane how good Dame is this year and how bad we are I wanna go big Trade Whiteside and Baze for Love, Thompson and Clarkson Whiteside and Baze for Thompson-Love works straight up ? Im drunk DM-ing rich to make this Tristan trade happen Drastic times Seriously tho Hezonja and Tolliver are so ass Idk how we fix it Whiteside is not as much of an issue As the 4 spot Thank god we have him to remind us of how sane we sre *are ????

Oregon legend Carmelo Anthony Ill go 30 He had 28 last year against the Nets I think Houman we have aids we need the cancer to cure the aids But really we need someone at the 4 who isnt afraid Mario is afraid and Tolliver is an old role player Its non guaranteed Literally such a low risk play Everyone likes Melo Its more of a style issue but style is a better problem than talent Nassir Little is our best PF! Hes a child! We need help offensively too We are literally playing 4-on-5 every night the way teams guard dame Playoff defense is now the norm Im just saying teams have played a box and 1 against us the last 4 games cause they disrespect everyone else And mostly everyone else has been limp dick when they get a chance 1v1 Last night dame literally had to yell attack!

Oooh okay lol Yeah theyre just BetOnline right now Yeah mid January We will see. You get humbled when youre out of the league for a year. I know its Melo but thats a hit to anyones ego Did anyone read the Woj column from the weekend? It was basically a message from Neil to Melo.

Festivus almost here! Is Derwin playing tonight? Ahh okay I thought I saw something that he was back hit that was premature I guess Im just remembering last years chargers chiefs game Probably the game of the year RIP The Bronx but also RIP The Bronx Subway ride And good ass cheap food Ian you gotta find a good Colombian bakery in Brooklyn If thats possible lol Oh of course My homie Brett lives in bush wick now he took me to Gladys Most fire jerk chicken Ive ever had Jerk fried Oh near the legendary park slope co-op Lol they still havent announced the signing Skal!

We need a solid 5 ISOs for Melo tonight Im gonna lose my shit on his first jab step Yeah Nico Melli is slow and not good on defense But he can shoot so we need Melo to close out Is this is the most anticipated blazers debut ever? It has to be right? Yes honestly I have But as a free agent I dont think theres ever been one As big as this The GO debut was a must see event Maybe but I honestly think Melo is more famous now than Scottie was in 1999.mostly because Melo was a Knick and beloved in New York Lol Dubov Burch just bought a Carmelo blazers 77 throwback Fucking vintage 1000% They dont have them on the ones you can buy from nba.,9 Nba dot com Or Nike either https://twitter.com/MarcJSpearsESPN/status/1196897832600510466 Hes 41 Fair Have no fear https://youtu.be/h_9t8Mi4OVE We have this guy now Spears says hes starting!

Carolina-Saints been a classic Theyre in prove it mode for me especially against bad teams I have no trust in them smh Not there yet But getting close For the Lakers? Yeah basically everyone except Avery Bradley Theyve been kinda lazy on defense last few tho Might let spurs hang around Joe Nope Shoulder He might need surgery John Belien! Something has to change And I dont want it to be Stotts So yes I really wanted whiteside to workout It just doesnt You already know ? We need this positive energy Lmaooo Wow thats wild So from what I gather mandalorian is kinda the only reason to have Disney+?

Im a big fan of Always sunny and pass out Which is what I use it for Also every guy fieri show on demand MELO DA GAWD BULLY BALL Your friend needs help Either that or hes trolling on a level even higher than Dylan and the Atlanta Cocks Melo with 25 and 8 Cherish this moment Im listening to the Power theme song on repeats Lala is behind the blazers bench We are the team of the culture Only twitter cares about that The crowd in Chicago is chanting for Melo! https://twitter.com/chold/status/1199161021170159617?s=12 *league Talking about the Blazers social media team when we win is like when USC students tried to shit talk me about class sizes when the Ducks kicked their ass at the coliseum I appreciate you letting us have this but you can do better than the social team You just got all smart about people loving Melo! Im talking about Melo! People love him! And he balled out Because of Melo! Right but the blazers being the team of the culture hinges on Melo Im also drunk JaVale playing in the 4th is not good For the cover Oh shit how much? LeBron baby Closing time Oh wow Thats awesome https://twitter.com/chold/status/1199168426046033920?s=12 Melo moved to 18th on the Nba scoring list tonight ? If he stays on the team he will pass KG by seasons end #HoneyNutCheerios I wish I had bet on it lmao Or that Id been allowed to Whats funny is theyre the worst pick and roll team in the league Theyre a total 90s team ? We needed a true weirdo for this blazers to hit their final form We needed Melo Well no but when Nurk and Collins are back Melo off the bench Champions https://trillblazin.net/ Do not share this outside of the superliga I was just trying to make sure they didnt sell out if anybody wanted stuff I had to log on too You guys. I cant believe I didnt see this with Melo before. ? Also Friday against Chicago is a game 40 dollar get in price right now Mark I assume Kawhi is but you never know with him its not a back to back so probably he does play Oh shit it IS a back to back Denver is so confusing. They keep stacking wins but the narrative is how theyre not playing that well They have been at home a lot Speaking of the Roy family, watched home alone the other day and its so weird seeing Roman Roy as a child lol ? My favorite Greek team brought back the god ? Not seeing it yet I think it gives casuals a reason to watch Its going to be part of the regule season schedule Regular Just some games in October and November will be play-in type games Theyre not stopping the season To do the tournament Teams will play divisional games to determine who represents the division, basically a form of group play thats already baked into the schedule Then its whoever wins the divisions + the two best teams in an 8-team single-elimination Idk an NBA version of the elite 8 sounds fun to me The whole thing is for people like you Houman People that endlessly complain the regular season means nothing How? Money, glory, winning a competition Nobody says that a championship isnt still the ultimate goal But a single elimination tourney is like the exact opposite of a7 game series! Whats the value of any sport we watch? Entertainment Theres no way the owners or players are going to agree to a 70 game or 66 games or 5 game first round or basically anything that lowers the amount of revenue This tourney adds some excitement in a situation where you cant make a major major change That should make it an even more dope accomplishment if you win the double And then that could become its own thing Im getting into Top Boy next time you see me Im gonna be speaking purely British slang It looks like a Nickelodeon set Jesus Also boys Gonna be in the House for Melo ? First ever sourdough stuffing Hell yeah Dubov its pretty straight forward, probably the toughest thing is toasting/slicing a whole loaf of bread But its the only way to get premium stuffing IMO So I guess what I made is dressing cause we got a turkey from Elephants this year lol So weird theyre losing lol Myles Powell is one of the few college players I know and I like that hes a dog Saw some Big East tourney last year with him I believe The crowd when Melo touches it is like a playoff game lol Every touch the crowd starts buzzing Melo chants Crowd going apeshit on every touch This is amazing 19 points, 4 rebounds on 9-11 shooting and 2 assists Terry just gave him a curtain call With 8 minutes left ? They had to suck our dicks from the back in front of everyone at the bar ?How we starting https://twitter.com/barstoolsports/status/1200133996115562497 Crucial Cam! I just cracked open some Sauvignon Blanc and Im several edibles deep Oh the hazelnuts tho What they got on them? Oh shit Could we have a Ronan Farrow/Frank Sinatra situation???? With Greg Anthony as woody Allen ?????? Maybe this is why the Jail Blazers movie hasnt gotten made Ian whats the price on a Meyers Jersey? Ive always been pro Meyers Ian Theres no other Heat whose Jersey I would want to rep Meyers was once a guest on locked on blazers ? Merry Christmas ya filthy animals Im high And drunk Tweet that shit If he goes off early Im firing Understandable Our second chance d raging is bottom 5 Doesnt tell the whole story but tells par Part No. 27 out of 30 to be exact Yes Only cause they both went to Michigan state Anybody who watched them knew it was bullshit Lol Whiteside had 4-6-6 blocks #blessed Until March I hooped after a shoulder surgery but I also dont play in the NBA What he does, rebounding and blocking shots he has to heal Im gonna get a Marcus Smart Jersey ? I love you guys I mean its natural we just didnt have that extra championship mentality Just started the Irishman so probably not Man that sucks about Aminu Jajaj this game is gonna be fun for you guys Omg panthers Lakers-Mavs is some high quality sport Lakers now getting their asses kicked by Luka He has 16 in the 3rd and the Lakers had 17 as a team lol Holy fuck Chris Peterson steps down That was unexpected ? That was a great game Kelly Oubre aka Wave Papi defensive takeover late Lakers Nuggets tomorrow Lets go Gimme the Lake show Bron and AD gonna make Jokic look extra fat while making Barton and Murray extra small They said yesterday their goal is to never lose 2 in a row And the Nuggets are No. 2 Easy time for a statement If I was betting right now I would bet Lakers tomorrow ML Yes fucking amazing Ive bet on the Lakers a lot But tomorrow is a value on lakes IMO Thats more what I meant but I love a narrative ? Gonna need like 4 screens for all the good ball tonight Lakers-Nuggets too Miami Toronto Victory!!! Christian is greed! Freed! Great call DUBOV I just picked him up! Also Oladipo is practicing with the Fort Wayne mad ants tomorrow Matty what are you talking about your team is 4-2 lmao Im 2-4 Lmaoo I forgot to set my lineups last week but its a long season baby! Yes Jesus Christ at that tweet lmao Yeah it was fun! Yeah of course lol I wont be there either but I am excited regardless Duncan Robinson and Meyers Leonard look like long lost cousins Blazers? Kawhi and PG are playing Gary Trent is healthy I think lineups are due 45 before so in about 10 minutes Gary Trent out btw Everyone else good to go I would take the points tonight I think they can get the 6 seed Its just gonna be too much for them to get to the top half with how they started Thats probably their ceiling I mean weve played well but also we played the bulls and the thunder Feels like Hassan is more engaged with Melo around Been tuned in The east is back! Jimothy! Come on He doesnt warm up its weird I love how Whiteside wears Jordan 14s lmao Like every game Thats what those are right? Shout out to my girl Allie LaForce Best Clipper Ever Hassan is starting to understand pick and roll basketball Yes That hurt to watch What they didnt know was that Melo had already been broken... Mortal injuries can no longer stop him Wow Ant! Lakers Nuggets a 3 point game Hezonja In White flag waved Im glad you made money It makes ME feel better Hassan actually was good I thought we abandoned playing real offense because the clippers length is that scary We just went to post ups or ISOs with maybe one pass So scared of turning it over Clippers make it worse tho Im not gonna overreact to tonight Yeah but it was last year too We were 25 in assists This year we are 29 So we have taken a step back for sure https://twitter.com/cranekicker/status/1202233186203426818?s=12 Lmao no damn thats it https://www.complex.com/life/2019/12/pelotons-market-value-dropped-by-942-million-in-one-day Peloton lost almost a billion in market value cause the ad they did bombed so hard lmao Their stock price Jazz have lost 4 of 5 Id hit the lakers Its better to feel right! This is why Disney wouldnt buy twitter ? Lakers ballin early Jesus Nassir looks like Aminu with the haircut Its so much better living in a pre Arye world In that hes a stone cold killer? Cause I see that for sure Matty I should know but I just asked myself the same thing 2nd round pick Jesus Baze thanks for showing up Only took 1/4 of the season beating Utah after losing to ASU is SO this team and SO Justin herbert Also isnt this like, the biggest football game in Utah school history? Their best win is what? BYU? lol I got Freddie Gibbs honestly didnt expect it But I smoke a lot so You can hit those falsetto bars bunky Melo contract guaranteed Listen man I cant even be brought to imagine going back to Hezonja and Tolliver Im thankful for Melo Absolutely But I think hes legit serious about this aint no farewell tour Hes being a great team guy which matters the most Making the extra pass, rotating on defense Im not gambling but if I were I kinda like the Knicks getting 9.5 at home against the nuvgefs Nuggets Wow sounds sick anybody have hard drugs I can do instead Trade K Love and all the vets then Beilein is good But maybe he doesnt work in the pros Im just judging by the offense and stuff he was running which I liked But I didnt know he wasnt getting along with guys Im sure thats it Just frustrated vets on a bad team bitching just to bitch Kevin Love just doesnt wanna be there lmao Hes moved from having Channing Frye tweet about a trade to Portland to having The Athletic drop a Beilein hit piece Damn I just got a CBD shot in my coffee shop you cant do that shit in Utah Sco Ducks Ian when you get old like me youll get into CBD Good thing I smoked a lot of weed earlier today End of a road trip, theyve been undefeated on the road so far this year Maybe Vegas thinks theyre due for a close one https://twitter.com/pchopz_/status/1203112706099859456?s=12 Impossible to do salary wise Would have to be whiteside And Melo cant be traded since we literally just signed him He doesnt need to change What hes been doing for us
Is great Ahh for sure Hes helping us win so thats the style I prefer Losing is a less good style imo Looked like an Achilles too! Fun! Awful Olshey was just in the locker room Just waiting for the Woj bomb Neil back in the tunnel no doubt on the phone with Woj Hell yeah Ugh I guess hes picking up his player option now Dec 15 trade coming It has to now Guys ? Its time Ruiz-Joshua baby Just threw down on Ruiz +200 Joshua is winning IMO but Ruiz has landed a few quality shots Ruiz got cut in the first round but hes fine now Joshua is also dancing on him Joshua with a clinic man Also Andy just showed up too heavy Im gonna trail you Because this is the same game Keanu bets on in Hardball Bring back the BCS Clemson is cancelled BCS or 8 team playoff challenge Holy god Suarez is an All-Scumbag starter Whats he doing Yes Epic play Best tight end in football I want that in the playoffs That was such a great football game Im too emotionally burnt out the blazers to also bet on them The pain of losing hood is sobering for at least a few games Whats the heat line This is a close one Im working but I will be there Damn Ian thats brutal That blows man Brutal beat Live by the sword God Whiteside can be such a boss sometimes Matty and I are locked in a classic in our Salem league ? Its down to the defense Also I started pascal over Sanu give me a fucking award Wow absolutely brutal loss in the super liga Lakers-Bucks finals and AD-Giannis is gonna be a classic ? Brock Im working from home today and that just sounds cozy tbh Kawhi load management tonight Im worried that his knee thing is really going to shorten his career That what makes LeBron so special man I did not Apparently not It was approved by the Browns PR and they were filming content for themselves of their advance scout Nah They suck Pelicans were fun for a few weeks and aside from beating the blazers theyve been pretty bad He has been I think he dunked on Giannis the other night Going for 15 straight I think The bucks Yeah I would go pistons If I were to bet I really cant wait for the pacers to get Dipo back They could be a legit dark horse if hes back to being regular Dipo They could make the conference finals If Dipo is Dipo But thats a long ask Considering his injury He probably needs a year like Hayward I think Brogdon gives them a legit No. 2 option But yes they are overachieving Im honestly excited to have such a great matchup Thats gonna be a good game Everything else sucks tonight Jazz-Thunder could be good I lean Pacers tonight too Its a tough call Im thrilled for arroyo Mostly cause now we can have a better o coordinator Chip Kelly? O coordinator?? Ugh Omg Ive always liked KOC Always been a huge fan Really love his team building philosophy Dude what is Baze giving us Just put Trent and Nas out there Play 3 guards more Baze got a of steals but neutralizes it by fouling a ton And he doesnt make shots or good decisions with the ball God Im so jealous This is a week I would be out there lol Tristan diving to the rim Getting offensive rebounds like a supercharged Ed Davis Feel like its pretty normal tho I dont personally drink a ton of milk My wife is white. Yes. Im just saying I do buy milk for the house only for her I dont ever drink it unless Im having a cookie I cant do milk in the mornings Fucks me up I got milk at voodoo donuts the other day But for dessert Im v into oat milk My new fav milk alt Wow I didnt even realize the subconscious But thats totally a trauma associated with milk Lmaoo Lmao Matt Barnes talking on his podcast about swallowing a whole blunt cause the cops pulled him over Guys I just realized something awful Hezonja has a goddamn player option I would for sure hit the Over In both respects Mike Miller but not That Mike Miller Former G League coach of the year Omg Heat starting OT on a 15-0 run lol Hell yeah dude Its coming back! Incredible choke lmao Lakers on Friday is gonna be a fucking show Dame also cleared the over with ease Idk I just now he hit it in the first half Im pretty sure Great night had by all Shit imma take the raptors tomorrow too I think theyre gonna come out on fire Bucks -13 is also a hammer IMO Pelicans SUCK Yeah thats true and its the kind of game a young team could get up for Potentially snapping the streak could be a major motivator Just may not be 13 Magic are feisty But Lakers are gonna whoop that ass Avery Bradley back and no rondo Basically a plus lmao And DPOY Him vs John Isaac tomorrow is the block battle Yeah hes insane Hes literally made life so easy for lebron It was like a 22-0 run Yeah dude I bet the ML Was like Heat +700 with a minute left Live He shut Siakam down which was pretty bad ass I was blown away at his assist total I really need more Duncan Robinson coverage I cant believe he played DIII hoops I had the same thought this week Ian Now is the time to strike Before they fatten up at home and get to .500 How many are we again? 8 is the max you can get on the ticket master app So we probably do need to do a row? Kuzma out for the Lakers Not a big deal tbh lol Bradley back, rondo questionable Kuz has barely impacted games this year honestly Hes had like 3 big games Hes just not as crucial with AD Honestly I think theyre better off in crunch time playing AD and Dwight Than throwin Kuz in there Im not actually gonna bet but I would think about a pelicans play East is better now I just wrote that for some branded content I just did but I legit believe it More teams with 16-plus wins, more teams with above-.500 records And the Bucks just whooped the Clippers asses Toronto spanked the Lakers Denver is having an awful East road trip Utah just had one the west has been a major disappointment https://www.nbcsports.com/northwest/portland-trail-blazers/big-time-players-trail-blazers-are-probably-not-going-after Dwight laying it out: Love, Blake Or LaMarcus My gut tells me Olshey wants Blake most Yup thats why Nah just give them a protected first We need to keep as much shooting as possible He was dealing with some injuries last few weeks If Detroit thinks they can sign someone with cap space and they wanna open up more room to keep Drummond Then we could help them do that I think Love and TT is still the best deal tho. Cause we get TTs bird rights and hed be a perfect backup for us Yeah we need a wing Who actually is good at defense And doesnt foul all the time Wow no Fultz for Orlando Lakers are about to really whoop on them with just DJ augustin 2020 Nurk Nuggets fans like to blame Murray But now hes just not good Will Barton has arguably been their best player Hes too 5 in real plus minus Top* She kinda looks it but Mila is not a Hispanic name The only Mila I know is a Balkan chick That was amazing Yeah dude its classic Hes right tho hella people post quality highlights And Wob is still doing it from his phone He can hes just lazy Theres programs you can get To rip straight from your computer or apps like Clippit Very much a big J hill Im too high hoping this Kings-Thunder game gets close Yeah the Wob snitch tagging is wack Yeah its so dumb Just say less Especially for Wob lol Dude the hornets man Former second round pick I believe Wow Ian The holiday spirit is flowing!

God Im so stoked on our defense for next season already Yes very sad We are so bad at fourth and short I too am your buddy Limp snap Wow Brady breeze Herbie looking like Josh Allen I agree with Simmons that the chargers should get Jameis Not having a back up center is a bold strategy At least Melo has showed up, dame and CJ are absolute no shoes tonight I am passing on that They suck, everyone is hurt and knows this roster is a place holder Just a shit season Theres a non-zero chance Nurk is ready by then Nurk is a key to getting the ball to move again Bless Whitesides heart hes just not a good passer Nurk will def be back, Collins not as sure At least this season Collins was 4 and then re-evaluation So beginning of March is 4 months They shouldnt sit him if hes healthy and ready to play. Its gonna take him time to get his timing back and shit anyway Zions injury is way more worrisome to me than Nurk Yeah I believe Zion will play soon but Nurk has been going hard for a few weeks now. I dont see any reason to be overly cautious. Lol at fan voting Alex Caruso in the top 10 for guards in all star votes Ahead of ja and Devin booker Dude kids are obsessed with Tacko I swear the Celtics only signed him for promotional reasons lol Yeah all-nba is really more important Woj doesnt vote for awards out of protest lol I just voted.

Out! Huge! I just bought back a parlay to bet that hardaway number Lol I was looking for a sabonis rebounds prop but couldnt find one Also part of the reason I bought back my parlay is I didnt wanna double down against the spurs THJ has 7 early in the 2nd Q The Seahawks finally get busted? Smh Good on your friend chas Chad* Luka at halftime with a total of 25 on p/r/a Wow Iconic Also not sure what the blazers line is tomorrow at Minnesota but KAT is almost definitely not playing Im hammering that The wolves have been the worst team in the league for like a month Also just did a live Pelicans -3.5 vs Bills/Bucks -14 at Warriors/Knicks +14 at Jazz parlay *Bulls not bills 4 more points for THJ The Celtics got absolutely served tonight #gambling THJ ?? OKC is so much nicer to the guys who left after KD its weird PG basically requested a trade and got a tribute video FACTS The kid has incredible flow https://twitter.com/chold/status/1215320744332341248?s=12 Yes! Also I want to ask the liga a trade question CJ for Ben Simmons you would do? The media is banging the Trade Ben Simmons drums Amen Youd just play both Simmons would create so many transition opportunities He could even guard the 5 in certain lineups SHEESH Im gonna pass! Have at it! The sixers would be so dumb to trade him IMO They can legit beat Milwaukee But if they are that dumb! They could do worse than CJ Mike Leach to Mississippi state thank god Never having to go against Leach again >>>>> I suppose so? https://twitter.com/kerryeggers/status/1215354790122647552 The OG with a great call Hahahaha A second rounder prob gets it done Hes 3rd string https://twitter.com/CariChampion/status/1215393866884403200 Noooooooo Dame had a bad game last time for him and his over under is currently 27.5 Im taking the dame over Im also taking Ben Simmons +16.5 tonight No Embiid thats gonna be easy Celtics +1, OKC +4, Portland ML Im not betting the house but Im playing that parlay tonight In addition to the scoring props Really sucks they dont let you parlay those with spreads Yeah I think You havent truly lived until you win a bet on a Ben simons free throw Playing Jaylen Hoard Watch us pull a Bs win over the bucks on Saturday This is our lot in life Whitesides contract lol And general relief Real question: have we been good at getting butts to nuts since Kazemi? Thank god this is an espn game I can watch Legendary lmao Billy W talking about Casey benson is making so happy https://twitter.com/KendrickPerkins/status/1215478322638938112 Josh Green is sick Im just saying its not like it was just us being shitty, AZ has talent Were the refs on the take??? I want PP to drive the lane PP with the dirk omg God I love PP I need a 3 jersey The ducks are so sick So much depth and then we have Pey Natty on deck We need to trade Hassan and baze If not I hope we have a plan on a free agent in 2020 of which there are few Hes just not very good and thinks hes a playmaker when he is hit *not Thats the book on Baze He may be the worst decision maker theyve ever had He makes Aminu in transition look efficient Kellen is the New Jason Garrett lol All that fiber bro! Eating vegan gives you bigger shits Oh wow you ate vegan and played basketball?! Lmaooo I made vegan chili this week, it was dope Ive been having it at lunch lmao Lots of time to work out Theres no dairy Got you I use the beyond stuff too Ian we feel like Jimmy Butler over 20.5 is a slam dunk tonight right? Ok Ill pass ? The chili recipe! Obviously its just a guide but you can customize If you have an instant pot or pressure cooker you could do it in an hour but probably will take a little longer on the stove top Also I found my bet Kuzma +18.5 at even money No Anthony Davis Im also going with LeBron over 48.5 points/rebounds/assists Dude they might be more than that once they get Zion They are gonna be in the mix for 8 I think Only 4 back The warriors are really the only team in the west that cant make the playoffs lol That sucks man Also jimmy has 31 lol Kuzma with 11 in the first q and his o/u was 18.5 lol Kuzma ?? Mavs back in Thibs This* No centers for the Lakers was a killer And they are somehow like on a 8-0 run Or 6-0 lol https://twitter.com/jwquick/status/1215836562509795328 Rondo has to pass to danny green instead of that bullshit reverse prayer lol Ive got a hot hand for player props and Im trying to keep it going with Lamar scoring the first touchdown +700 This is a heat check lol https://twitter.com/FearTheBrown/status/1215736998872395776 Lololol Wow no Whiteside tonight And no Whiteside too but we had Skal then We rolling with Tolliver and maybe like Hezonja at center?? Or perhaps Carmelo Gonna ask Jody Allen why shes so cheap Lol I picked the wrong 6 seed to bet the money line ton *on Only thing that can salvage this wretched day of betting for me is AJ brown getting 61 yards lol Cant wait to hear about how Mariota played as Lamar on the scout team Thunder treated it like playing a g league team Blazers will post a Nurk photo for sure Mike Vrabel two games away from cutting his dick off https://twitter.com/joesimonssays/status/1216219574779052033?s=12 1:3 wow Cali edibles really next level Omg What a classic commercial I havent had panda in a minute Id go with that tbh Dubov and I got some t bell last week, shit hit the spot The Crunchwrap is so damn good lol Bovada has some uncut gems esque lines today I just put 3 bucks on Deshaun +325 passing, +55 rushing and 3 passing TDS To hit at +3300 Lol The true Howard ratner of our lives James Romero Deshaun survived maybe the best secondary in the league last week hes taking the top off early Brain genius God I love the arena football league Hes coming back Need 13 receiving yards, 25 passing yards and a TD from deshaun to win 100 bucks here *14 rushing yards Excuse me 18 rush yards Thats a bad call lmao As a neutral observer who has the Seahawks +4.5 ?????? Aaron Jones prop baybeeeee I played the Hawks and the Over with my lost dollars as well as AJ 115+ +20 carries 2+tds We just got Siakam back today we can pull the upset on Chad I dont care how fraudulent they are as long as they cover 4.5 Lmao incredible zoom Rengel Pete just fucked the cover What an asshole Sandler got screwed smh Lonzo is ballin tho And Ingram But yeah they need favors Its okay Matty The posters creed is that sometimes you must post something you dont want to post Twitter rumor that Zion is back on Thursday Seriously thank god Welp Ingram is questionable now Sore right knee Holy fuck this is wild ?Huge upset over chad baybeee We needed that We get Dipo back in two weeks we are about to be the titans of the Superliga Clemson to score first is currently +125 On bovada When celebrity culture and influencer culture collide Omg lmaooo Sounds like a future bar tbh https://twitter.com/bubbaprog/status/1216887986647904262?s=12 Really wish I had put the under In a parlay God I wish he could go to the nfl now Perc 30 got Zion on Twitter just now lol Guy fieri is at the blazers game And Im not Difficult times I hope so Nurk I would say a month or so, Zach I would not expect this season Could be even 3 weeks on nurk But no earlier than early Feb Zach says he wants to be back in March but I just dont see it Omfg I dont wanna fuck with Skalsky on Clemson Neck roll = dont fuck with me Trash call Whats happening here? I love coach O So Im okay losing 15 bucks I also have a 5 team nba parlay alive right now Need the Lakers to turn it on 2nd half and then I have magic +2, hornets +9.5 (blood money) I dont think he has any say in the music but I know one of the blazers directors of photography and hes a major raver Lakers up 14, hornets cover, magic winning let make money!!!

Yeah I mean Dame is 3rd in backcourt votes Hes pretty popular and lakers fans still think they can get him Shit I just changed it Celtics letting my parlay down tonight Everyone else in the mix but the Cs getting outplayed by the pistons at home lol Oh wow also them Shout out to the Canadians at The Score Its the best app They also publish my articles with my byline on their app when I write for the AP unlike ESPN Dame to get a double-double is +275 on Bovada Just saying He had a bad back last time out in Houston Wednesday night is perfect because we can always make more bets cause theres like 11 games ?Wednesday NBA be like God can we please hold on This would easily be the best W of the season if they can Im down too Jason Quick dropped the B-Roy article Dude its so long WOJ! https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1217854890858381313?s=12 Yeah just Allen Crabbe for a back up PG is great https://twitter.com/mikeacker/status/1217858048657522695 Yeah you cant be doing that shit This is not a Masai Ujiri at the warriors game situation I have the Cs +10.5 in a parlay but I just changed bets lol Damn the Two Popes sequel is wild +5 I think 128-123 Just need the Magic to cover 11 and the Nuggets to win by 4 and we win 109 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtS_tVCyHIs Thats when the blessings come in! Skip to 5:35 Im not sure really, Mitchell more likely IMO Dame is a lock I think Chris paul should make it too F LeBron
F Anthony Davis
F Kawhi
G Harden
G Luka

6 Dame
7 Chris Paul
8 Jokic
9 Paul George
10 Donovan Mitchell
11 Rudy Gobert
12 LaMarcus 

 All due respect to Ingram LaMarcus is a key to winning For a better team Dude fuck Westbrook I give LaMarcus my respect instead Hes a defensive anchor and hes wet from 3 this year LA is 44% from 3 lol Better late than never Shooting almost 3 a game https://twitter.com/jquadddddd/status/1218021838443438081?s=21 Dubov your snow picture this morning was fire content I dont really think so Yeah but I dont know how that gets distributed Im cold but I went with this today ? Feel like healthy raptors against the Wizards are a loco *lock Great news for the Blazers: Dame is questionable with the illness that took out CJ and Whiteside last week No not at all I won a parlay betting hornets against the blazers this week Fucking bulls I just bet on portland ML I can feel it in the air Dame is getting the team to turn around I feel like its getting easier Ive had way more feel for the last few weeks than say, November and early December Amazing lmao Btw we love this start! They are fucking dancing ? ?Never forget the reason for the season boys https://twitter.com/ShamsCharania/status/1218648441619873792 Even Harrison Barnes is an upgrade I would gladly do Wow Ariza? Wow Lol He hasnt been good in a minute Maybe Ariza will start That alone might get him to play like he gives a shit Terrible All about cutting money Guys you know how I am so Im just gonna say this. Ariza is in the 90th percentile in the league in transition scoring this season per synergy And Bazemore was... Definitely not that high in transition This ultimately sucks but it could be an addition by subtraction move. And Swanigan at least gives us another center So if we trade Whiteside soon we arent totally fucked on the glass Listen man anybody who is above 6-9 would be helpful This is how bad our big man situation is after Whiteside ? https://twitter.com/JustRyCole/status/1218649570076286976 This is phenomenal news for us This guy is literally always wrong about everything It is known Hes wrong about everything, meaning our trade is good if he thinks its bad Science Gary Trent breakout lol https://twitter.com/cwmwrites/status/1218739283491729410 This is hilarious lmao They introduce Myles Garrett and totally ignore baker mayfield So sick He definitely loves Conor Aligning himself with the Boston Irish Dude youre like in the early story stages of one of the mighty ducks movies So guys my new chronic optimism blazers take is that theyre gonna eventually find a way to trade Whiteside for Gallonari and then trade someone else to another team to get under the tax Thats kinda the only positive outlook Because its pretty clear Jody wants them not to pay the tax this year So the Kevin Love dream is dead But especially when dame is in his prime And two second round picks Thats a pretty steep cost Ariza might actually be better than Bazemore for the money He also only has 1.8 guaranteed for next season So we could easily throw him in a trade and the next team can buy him out so he can be on the Lakers or whatever And the question with Gallo is whether OKC would want Whiteside. Chris Paul might kill him Im in on that final score Rengel I believe in the over 46.5 Dude that motivation is key to the Niners pass rush I threw the Heat in a couple of NFL parlays today for the culture Titans! Somebody cut that coaches dick! *cuba gooding JR voice* They got 3rd and 22!!? God hes so sick Yeah I mean Ariza can be better than baze period Game That was amazing Packers are like a knuckleball pitcher tho, they always play the game on their terms KC -2 Chillin lol I need one more TD and Ill be in the money Lets gooooo I had one plus the over ? Tomorrow. For Martin. I also just plunked down lots of money on chiefs -1.5 and the over ?Lmao I didnt even see this I got it at 53 So sad I havent listened yet Yeah I mean it does make a difference in who you play Do the clippers really wanna play the lakers in the 2nd round? I guess it doesnt matter much because Kawhi would probably rather do it earlier I guess I dont think they do but I think the clippers are vulnerable against those teams The clippers can def beat the lakers but I think someone else in the west could beat the clippers but not the lakers in a series, if that makes sense Goddamnit I shoulda known not to bet against Atlanta on MLK Day The raptors are BLOWING this lol Im listening now Brock and windy calls Adam Silver a cuck in the nicest way possible The play-in tournament is cool Mid season tournament isnt as cool as the play-in, IMO I think Windys points are more prescient than Arnovitz, IMO. The NBA has quality products to market that they look over. Honestly fitting Is it weird that when I see Ja Morant I see the ideal version of Bronny James? Ill take answers off sir *air Tim Tebow: congrats on the sex
