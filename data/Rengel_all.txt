2 blazers
1 mariners
1 Portland As They can have one of those but only if it comes in the next 2 seasons 14 straight years of missing the playoffs Wow Skimming through tweets it looks like they flew back to la Rush SigEp https://twitter.com/trailblazers/status/1082419132824457217?s=12 GCU student section goes harder than the pit crew I think so Idk I just signed up for Facebook and I must say its a nice way to stay in touch with my racist uncles ?The Bulls But who will sing, I believe I can fly? ?Whos coming with? Kyler Murray to the Kards Troy Dye back for senior year! I hate sports We were looking like a team for once. Fuhhhhh I did Houman I had the teal one growing up.

I know the seasons early but without a clear favorite I think we can do it if we continue to play like that Finishing in top 4 will be key Arizona sweeps are hard to come by but I think theyll have a good shot. Nice to have a competitive OSU for teams to have to get up for once too They talked about it at the end but for them to kill USC and then beat AZ on the road after blowing the UCLA game is pretty impressive. Last years team would have lost both of those Ferocious animal, friend of the pigeons Idk Steve Kerr was pretty money He also won the bulls the title in 97 Many kids will find out he played with MJ when the 30 for 30 is released https://youtu.be/BGTIq4yO-og HILARIOUS lol ^moves to New Orleans for 2 weeks.

Doesnt necessarily back my side but those fans were craving an nba team Theres some magic fans all over the world because of the shaq/penny teams Not really sure where all this is going but bandwagon fans are lame af. Sure you can appreciate LeBron or great teams but you dont need to change your allegiances Bandwagon fans make those franchises a shit ton of money tho That being said I really enjoyed watching duke in their comeback Ill see you guys at pioneer courthouse square for the championship parade!

First time playing with them in a long time but hopefully well run it back soon About to get that job Idk I think hed win Brock - can you explain the ducks current run without using the word momentum? Im kinda kidding. I was listening to a Pac-12 podcast and were only using the word momentum. You are correct Sorrrrry They actually have a dope intro rap .

Never mind Ya buddy Gundy. A lot of similarities between the teams for sure Plus KSUs best player is out if we get them next Sorry I thought Gundy said that haha That being said I dont want to hear anybody but Clayton praising the ducks when we knock off duke for the chip If you dont love them at 15-12 then dont love them at 29-12 Theyd also be a 5 seed.. but whats the difference now But definitely they flipped a switch and bought into everything they are doing now I know I care more than most but I would put this high on my list as accomplishments for the teams I follow I tried but couldnt haha. They suckered me back by blowing out asu Ill own up if they lose Friday. Not like its gonna be an easy game either way. The ncaa gifted them this bracket tho so u gotta feel good. Ncaa wins when the ducks win Table 1 is Houman https://twitter.com/jasondondean/status/1108412062504570880?s=12 Benson, young, Jackson, cook, Wooten Yeah he was the man freshman year. Unfortunately he had little to work with the rest of his career Snipped his ear jinxed his career Thats a title team Benson severely underrated Well they might be a 7 seed cuz Dorsey never did much til March Thats so lame ? I think its matt long Hes that in Jordans too No prob A $10 jimmy johns, subway or jersey mikes gift card Jersey mikes is better. Firehouse the best tho If no one else enters I believe payouts will be $1,534, $472, $236, $71, $48 ? Yeeeeeeee 118 The same number of games mariners will win this year ?I went for cheddar lol.

Bunk sandwiches it is I may have entered some fake brackets... RINGLEader No Im jp Just playin My Minnesota friend is confident theyll get to elite. Im scared to tell him theyre trash Predictions on biggest upset of day? I put Nevada in elite 8 on my sandwich bracket I mean they were in elite 8 last yr and didnt lose much. Tennessee is an experienced team like that too I have Florida st in final 4 Their logo is a stock logo from google searches.. Colgate that is. Also their toothpaste taste bad Group closed at 120. So add a couple sandwiches to my previous totals In high school? 2.98 but only cuz I skipped my last final Its too bad cuz LSU is pretty sick You gonna say that when Tennessee is cutting down the nets? I know I like them but I think once they get to the sweet 16 the distraction will be too big For sure Elam ending is coming Dubov, apologize to the gophers now His TBT team takes a hit too! #TripleSpillage in LSU Yale game Chris dudley and kavanaugh can suck it.

Periscope it for the liga Patrick the legend Welp I used to always get called for that haha And boxing out on the shooter Gotta include KG if youre putting Nash on that. Id go Kobe for overall factors Ya most of it I think I was talking about chads list Yao Ming was bigger than Giannis in popularity All Giannis has is live sports and big hands. Yao had a super bowl commercial ?? Pretty crazy but that was lowest point of nba TNT giving Kerr 2 f bombs Anyone want to go tonight? Tix are pretty cheap All the fans root for a new team now as well Games on ESPN news Are you on 2 phonez Dylan? Either that or lulu is on the email one?

The blazers are winning the championship and nothing else matters They didnt say much when I heard them talking about it but they were praising cj Not really but he may have been doing that when the broadcast started We got him, Kenny and the truth on our side tho O my Lillard status Are they playing the water bottle flip game? https://twitter.com/tampabaytre/status/1127754826719404037?s=12 Whoa And about that shirt design - why would u promote a shirt that essentially promotes the team were playing But looking at both they didnt really steal it but definitely used his to design theirs Ya he doesnt really seem like an nba guy but hes been killing in college for like 15 yrs so why not give it a shot And was the 3rd most important player in the team yesterday Add Zion and thats a dope squad Idk on first take they were saying sixers should trade him and build around Simmons Next year is 20 year anniversary of wcf team so thatd be pretty dope I only went to a game I dont remember that aspect so you are probably correct. I went to a Portland power game too tho WNBA started out pretty hot tho and got too big for its own good. Cuz once hype and comets went away they essentially had to start over. Kinda like mls starting too big I did not I went to a indoor game In Minnesota- it was sick Blazers are winning the series Its all about klubachar Tix for all the games here are like $250 average for 300 level The finals ones are like $800 Damn Hes from Hayward His idol will forever be Dwayne the Rock Johnson Its like Marvels version of Space Jam That was good. Not sure why the put glickman in between PA and Kersey tho For sure but the wording was like a in memorial type way Turners response to Dame in As jersey: but but whaaaat about Portland... ^not a sports bar Yup Lets go frizz Grizz Kinda crazy with all the teams in the running. All about AD No where They can play together then trade him next year Conleys not going somewhere to be a backup Ya and in a week theyll be introduced to their new commission structure Lines were off the hook when wolves grabbed tyus Zion at Bourbon Heat Moe getting open at least. Chief has to make the bunny Ill take it Dames gotta slow down I mean Bells wasnt that bad Cant let Jarebko go off tho If Ayesha doesnt want it Sonya will do Fuck Go home Warriors fan Say whaaaat No those are both pippen jerseys I kinda like what they did. The half and half is normally cheesy ? Mark you are making me feel dumber than having to read the box to figure what this name meant The warriors blew a 31 point lead. We can do this Mark Jackson just compared klays last shot to Ray Allens game 6 shot They dont call that on them First to 110 wins Goodnight Before the season no one wouldve thought simons would be getting minutes in the wcf TMI Well at least the blazer fans in Turkey didnt have to endure that loss Shoutout Portland gear https://twitter.com/nbcsnorthwest/status/1128519874123304960?s=12 I think he knows too but wasnt going to admit it. If there is no adjustment tomorrow then we got a problem Optimism What made you change your defense for game 2? - reporter

Well I got added to the Sunday Funday SuperLiga, and they were adamant that we couldnt sag off Steph Terry Adding Terry now.. Not an all star O sorry lol Chad stop making up facts to support your agenda Zach Collins 10 And him crying to the media The blazers are in the western conference so they cannot play in the ECF Not the eastern conference finals I think they switch off who has what conference but ya I dont know how they determine that but I feel tnt has more of the early rounds Raptors blew that shit damn He wants more meyers Leonard too for d on the 3 Ill vote no Ya Id do it if it was Mike Tyson in hangover 4 And your medical bills would be 10k That guy had a costume on for protection AD will get traded to LA and NO will get #4 and a few others https://1080thefan.radio.com/media/audio-channel/bonzi-wells-dusty-cam-051519 Great listen Theyll do something next year and espn will drop the 30 for 30 coming 2021 Replicate that half She was being sarcastic If only the game was 26 minutes Dame with the 4 point play Series was going to be 2-2 going back to Oakland no matter what Were still forcing 7 I mean ya but we can dream Nba wants more money and more content of the Currys. Home team will continue to win Maite Chadzorla Or never mind that was someone else Idk it was hard to watch him down the stretch and Ive been trying to give him benefit of doubt Those alley oops and layups were gimmes at end which he couldnt contest Holy shit https://twitter.com/kgwnews/status/1129497424114794496?s=12 This ones incredible lol https://twitter.com/rexchapman/status/1129529739880931328?s=12 had no idea jodi Meeks was still playing Youre moving to Milwaukee? Tune to the pregame to watch cj get his nails done Dylan

Dylan 

Dylan Pierce went from blazers by 20 to warriors by 6 - all in 50 minutes Didnt like Meyers insert Usually tips around 7 min after start of broadcast but damn Honorary SigEp https://twitter.com/deadspin/status/1129926335282012160?s=12 Evan midrange The only thing Ive agreed on with the president Play for Meyers ?Stephen vs Sonics sighting Who says no? Damnit This guy gets it https://twitter.com/markkirchmeier/status/1129935892167061504?s=12 Meyers Leonard does it all https://twitter.com/riptwitty/status/1129937961288589312?s=12 Thank god for Meyers wife getting him to practice 3s with her Free Throw Guy is a bandwagoner Bell helping us out Need more Seth Blazers at halftime Omg Meyers Twitter is loving you right now Draymond is the leader Portland needs Hows that not a moving pick A 13 point lead is only safe with a minute left Dame used to show up in the 3rd Hes had 1 good game since okc If were gonna win this game they got to make a run with this lineup Quinn Cook getting better looks than kill Lill When the best option is a meyers 3.. Stop Houman theyve played the same amount of games Welp it was fun while it lasted Kd leaves and green curry Thompson stay with golden state for career? I wouldnt like this team by this point regardless but for them to dominate without them is ridiculous Hed look so good in a blazer uni Dame wanted game over quick too so he could catch the fight Be interesting to watch considering most were buying at $200+ Guys I think Dylan is asking us to make Monmouth Mondays a thing But hes also tired I could see it but I think their series will be over before bucks regardless- so idk why theyd risk injury to others I dont bet but I feel Toronto will win 1 at home So whats he telling Portland? Im cool with a good nba conspiracy theory but that aint it From the warriors side sure but bringing David stern into it is crazy talk Anyway Im fine with the sweep if it makes kd feel unneeded Ive held a door open for adam silver and he didnt say thank you The nba recruited him from the set of men in black II Im going on 2 weeks. Help me learn from your mistakes I can do that I used to live right by that, almost went once but decided not cuz the appearance of the outside haha Meyers is probably putting his order in right now I like that he had to include that pippen is a good tipper lol Probably haha Kenny Wooten leaving ?? Ya it seems like someone will take him 2nd round and if he has to play g league or overseas for a few years so be it So hard to watch. Damn Mark can you put $20 on meyers being an all star next year for me please $40* Theyre not gonna do that this offseason- not to upset the masses here but he probably gets 2 more years with us after next now tho Hes still technically young. Crazy Kanter only turned 27 today too I mean if they havent done Sabonis yet then who knows lol Larry Steele camp is epic tho ?Bobby gross Lillard has to be the next one besides PA Gerald Wallace count? I dont think sheed would want that Lets push this lead to 13 before half Confidence goes a long way Well u havent been an all star or all nba so we cant give I the super max but how does 17 million a year the rest of your career sound? Step backkkkk Get me the camo one Chad They are chanting Meyers Leonard Im buying the blessed shorts now Bs call Ive always seen him in New Orleans.....

The last ones crazy - it was like 100-82 min I think One other thing, when the blazers make the conference finals they usually go back the next year.. Ya without looking I think it only went 5 - I only remember Sean Elliotts shot I just watched the clip of his shot - sounds like we blew a 18 point lead in that one too haha Something like that but ya I cant remember exactly https://twitter.com/hontheboys/status/1130735469195603968?s=12 I was waiting to see the blazers go fishing Nooo..Thats the team I got in that bleacher report quiz Danny Kannels best example for why weed is bad https://twitter.com/dannykanell/status/1131672088392151056?s=12 I most likely will This game tho I think the rest will hurt gs in first game The 6 in six After holding 3-1 lead I can see it Whoever does it gets to go toe to toe with LeBron to run the city Thats a little too far.

In 7th grade we had to design a personal logo - mine looked like that but with an R. The teacher hated it. How did his team land on that I could see 6 in that scenario cuz they probably win game 4 too But who really cares at that point When you lose 2 games like that in a row its pretty deflating The point was if they pulled out game 2 tho Like Dylan alluded to throughout the series - a 14 pt lead is essentially a 5 point deficit He was so promising at first but I think that was clouded by Oregon dominating in football Avery Johnson Ya after he was a late night host Idk Lavar Balls not bad This is amazing lol https://twitter.com/complex/status/1133796630942113793?s=12 Russell, Kareem, Magic, Jordan, Shaq, LeBron You pick 1 from each decade So you think curry is the best pg ever space?

Please dont od If youve never done it before be aware that keef gets you way higher - so high youll start thinking the east is better then the west He wants to be the hero Outside of him getting more hurt but ya little risk overall- if they comeback and win his time there will be validated I dont think he needs to score a ton, he adds an extra guy they have to worry about now that has the capability of scoring every time tho. They get this one tonight the series should go 7 Kd going to lakers regardless Ya I only that happened Klay to minny butterfly effect Holey Moley will be Steph Currys legacy In slo mo it looked like it but not in real time That was a travel tho Holey Moley Ya idk after seeing the replay they just showed at least Guys if the warriors pull off the comeback, can we all agree that the West is the best conference of all time?

Drive Thru attendant: Sir this is a Wendys. They think getting those words on record today will guarantee him being exonerated too but I feel it does the opposite with his record of being honest is extremely low Hopefully the trends of all the governors losing after his multiple campaign visits will continue into the new year Just catching up .. I was reading his note to All the small things last night lol ?Bitch call me Dion Waiters. Im flying high tonight Meyers buys his friends At least we know who the most cultured city is at least 154-108 My flights delayed. Im gonna try all the deschutes No but wouldnt be surprised if they are right at the line - 31-17 Ok thats fair but I could still technically never be in question past mid 2nd quarter. Ill see my way out.. but for more big 3 bold takes u can follow me on tik tok Oregons legacy will be Mariota and the Sewell bros Well this is awkward ? https://share.icloud.com/photos/0ynCkcchc3vUTaDE5Vca1dGIQ Highlight of the game #TrumpsAmerica Packers are trash The actor that plays Kendal Roy should be him in a biopic someday Totally fair - just thought the thumbnail looked like him and never put 2 and 2 together S/o Garret Vee This timeout will determine game He doesnt touch rim Blazers need to draft him Hes gonna pull the whole Atlantis pool later Bout to be the Mathis show Ya after that last one especially Hes been killing every other game tho Trump has been impeached 2 bank threes for Powell damn 69 sec left and pritch can tie at 69 He does Holy hell Does Besaws have TVs?

Cole Anthony blocking Juiston at rim damn Steve Kerr says hi Circus in Atlantis right now Near same situation here as final four if UNC misses free throw Theyll be top 5 Ducks will have a big game there in 2 weeks with Dante Half of elite 8 might be the teams in Atlantis Obviously it sucks to lose but gotta like how the ducks played - free throws. Getting smoked down low will change with Dante Duarte can take over when ready For sure but I like having options haha Duarte is the next Scottie pippen lol Roll Tide Dont be that guy. We are clearly not a top 4 team And if Georgia wins sec wed still miss out Not really but it looks like we got a good shot at making rose bowl win or lose Im pretty sure I have a clue in their too... 14-3 houston Im the biggest Vikings fan in this chat Pro Bowl MVP Kyle Rudolph Vikes by 3 confirmed Kirk Cousins 0-8 on Monday night. Is that good? ? ?Is that you on the left chad? Idk seems like media kinda forced her out. She wasnt gonna win but was still polling decent ?Either they really like sex or are serial kidnappers ?Ducks to Rose Bowl looking Sign me up - just to pee in his urinal Ya in the bathroom I used at least. With a tv head level Can I Airbnb your room? I dont like your sarcasm - I worked very hard to fit into that demographic Ducks are gonna win Who has Utah beat? With no pressure we are pulling out all the gimmicks Plus Herbert shows up in games like this The only team that beat them with their 3rd string qb I know the players arent but everyone is acting like all they have to do is show up and they will stomp us Not you but the media is acting like we are a scrub cuz we lost to asu Lets see when they actually have to play someone with all the pressure on them Their loss to usc was on a Friday night too.. I actually agree with that - we are gonna run variations of that trick play we ran against Arizona - Mark it Ya but we had no motivation for OSU since the game technically didnt matter Lumineers for me Brock How do I find it?

Imagine a deal will be in place this afternoon Kellen Moore will be the Cowboys HC in 4 years Not saying I predicted it. Was more commenting on the huskies hire plus Wikipedia blurb in the tweet Thats probably true - hes in a good spot tho and I feel hell do big things with confidence from McCarthy For sure but theres a reason Jerry didnt let him really explore other coaching availabilities In your scenario he gets the boot with Garrett, so theres that Shough Whenever he came in he looked in control. Had a td pass in usc game and can also run like Herbert was at end of season https://twitter.com/alekarend/status/1190838219434147840?s=12 I think hell come in for run plays on occasion I think he could be next Russel Wilson All American in both baseball and football 3rd year plus got to learn from Herbert and has chemistry with Pittman who will be our number 1 Plus Im sure hes throwing to Devon Williams as we speak haha You will enjoy that short term 12 movie then lol In the SuperLiga news today - the group discusses the hiring of mike McCarthy, the possibilities of joe Moorhead leading the Oregon offense and Clayton shits his pants.
