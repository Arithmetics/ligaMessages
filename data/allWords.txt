Houman take notes Dubov. I have my jersey but have yet to wear in the world. Have my Dame jersey but have been wearing mostly authentic garb like elephant pants and linen shirts. All I can think about watching these bizarre Chic-fil-a commercials is how all these god fearing Christians votes for Trump The sole fact that he cheated on his pregnant wife with a porn star should nullify any Christian from supporting him Nothings more American than signing up for unemployment while laying $200 on Ohio St -7 Omg I love it The only way you could top that is by copping some food stamps for beer and pizza while you watch the game Papa Murphys and Subway qualify for EBT right!? Wait please tell me you signed up for unemployment in California while living in Washington. That's even better Of course S/O to that California government cheddar.

Buddy Hield's kinda nice Vivek is light years ahead of us Nurkics line 24 points, 23 rebounds, 7 assists, five blocks and five steals That's fucking insane I remember when we used to get stoked on a batum 5x5 game when he had like 10 points Never been done before in nba history Nobody has ever had a 5x5 with 20+ points and rebounds Holy fuck Hakeem is the closest ever and he had only 4 steals Nurk got a 5x5 tonight?!?!?! FUCKING HOOK EM ?He's gone rogue !!! Players averaging at least 14 points, 10 rebounds, 3 assists, 1.3 blocks and 1 steal per game:

Anthony Davis
Giannis 
Jusuf Nurkic Your cherry picked stat of the day, and evidence were winning the ship this year Wow you guys RIP to a legend Funkhouser What? Damn. https://deadline.com/2019/01/bob-einstein-dead-curb-your-enthusiasm-super-dave-osborne-smothers-brothers-1202527938/ Who? Legend from Curb So sad Dion Waiters is active for the first time this season Heat Championship soon Another stat for you guys today. This is for small sample size Dubov Seth Curry is leading the league in 3pt %. Only qualified player over 50%! https://twitter.com/espnnba/status/1080596948158156802?s=21 Lol https://twitter.com/jimmygards/status/1080580095704813568?s=12 https://www.instagram.com/p/BsJ03kQhtSN/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=y3zuuzu92qus Gundy did this reporter break any unwritten rules ? The self-snitch is always... a questionable decision. What was the guy thinking He did He also shouldnt have said that Its technically off the record What a nerd ?Lol You can still use off the record shit You just dont snitch on the dude who said it Yeah seems like a no no Especially after how Jimmy reacted What's all this PG for MVP talk Remember when olshey wouldn't include cj in a trade for him https://www.instagram.com/p/BsKG7gmhM7B/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=1mfkc4lyzzjss Yo Holy balls He elevated https://twitter.com/worldwidewob/status/1080689541193912321?s=21 Lol Coachella shit the bed this year with their headliners Piss off Houman, its white people music. I am just hyped they got Bad Bunny and J Balvin It really is Dubov other than what Gundy said If they would have added aneul aa I would have flown to indio WOW Gundy this Frank Gilles guy is coming at you Its what happens when you reach the top And with the disrespect, too. Didnt even spell Gundersen right. Bol Bol news is public ?? Disappointing season but lets see what they can do now https://twitter.com/sheaserrano/status/1080852763385450499?s=21 Good Serrano Sometimes I feel like he's become too big of a brand for his own brand u know Lol Shea is the man I think it just always happens when you get that many followers. If you stray from the brand people will get pissed lol I hope Luka is in the 3pt contest and only gets off 15 shots because hes stepping back on all of them Wait... James Harden had a 40 pt game on 8 made baskets? He is the worst thing about the nba by far Do you think New Orleans would prefer CJ, Collins, Simons and a first for AD over the Lakers package? Do you think we could tell them were sending ZC but actually send Meyers and see if they notice? No its over with AD. He signed with Clutch Sports his fate is sealed. The real question is should San Antonio boo Kawhi tonight? Doesnt matter. Kawhi is not capable of human emotion so its not like he would even feel it. My vote would be to boo kawhi and then go bananas for Danny Green Wow. Bananas? Really, Mark? Thats racist. This isnt the premier league. No place for that, imo. I said go now throw shoutout Paul Pogba ? Damn maybe Kawhi is human He looks SHOOK Does not compute Yea he looked bummed out when they bood him and cheered Danny also. Crowd is in his head **i called this** https://twitter.com/sportscenter/status/1080998685205508097?s=21 They probably just need to restart him and hell be fine. Happens to my computer all the time. Sidebar: Is Greg Monroes superpower the ability to grind any offensive possession to an abrupt halt? Woulda been a legend in the 80s/90s Remember when Greg Monroe and Roy Hibbert turned down our max offers. Lol thank the lord Throw in Chandler Parsons too lmao Hedoooo Man this is peak poppovic S/O to hedo's wife Spurs having frost as a sponsor as a callback to game of zones is great God the raptors just cant not choke https://twitter.com/claytoneric7/status/1081060527273472000?s=12 Youre right clay Two letters. E. J. Because I dont agree with gundys take. Bol Bol was a great signing as a recruit but lets be careful before we go comparing him to one of best conspiracy theorists in the association Plus then there was Mike Dunigan Aaron Brooks. Malik Hairston. Troy Brown. Garrett motherfucking Sim Peyton Prichard! Stole him from Oklahoma Bol is a unicorn! All Im saying is if boo played 9 games for any other team wed be treating him like Chandler Parsons Bol* Troy Brown was still more disappointing Wow harden for MVP Fuck golden state! I think that was the best game I've seen all year Easily From the 4th quarter on it was so epic back and forth Harden is unreal man. I hate all his flops and travels but that dude is the real deal Hes fucking crazy man If I need one bucket with the game on the line. I'm going with harden His range is deeper this year too Definitely That was justice too after that terrible missed call on KD Dude that was so bad hahaha. Idk if I've ever seen anything that blatant missed Nba is lit!!!

Christ do you even duck fan? not enough to take away from basketball I fell in love with the U of O because of basketball not football And I would be fine going to the occasional rose bowl Footballs just not my thing. I love hoops. Fair enough. I love basketball too, going WAY back, but football is just football. Hey guys check it out. I bought a house today ? Wooooooo Nice job Chad Big dog nice Lets go Oh hell yeah Is there room for the entire JCSL? Nice dick Also I see you with the concords Nice Js Thanks dudes! Yes all JCSL members are welcome anytime. Look me up if you're in Denver Dude that place is huge! Big ups Our boy is growing up Whens the housewarming party!? I'm trying to put together a boys trip out here in like May once it gets warmer and I get to know the area. I'll keep y'all posted! I'm also 15 minutes from red rocks so if there's any dope concerts worth traveling for this summer let me know Hobo Johnsom Johnson* https://twitter.com/zackfox/status/1080955444498055168?s=21 Probably late to the party on this one but wtf lol Oh my god I saw this and I could not believe the shit It's bad So if jimmy butler wants out this summer can we S&T CJ for him? Or is he a certified team killer at this point Dude he seems like the worst, idk if even dame could prevent him from stirring shit up Fuck Jimmy Butler Im kinda where Dylan is at. Hes on a potential championship contender and hes still bitching Anthony Davis would eat a guys ass to be on the sixers right now Hes also a number 3 guy on a playoff championship caliber team not a number 2 IMO Except he thinks hes fucking LeBron Yeah I feel that. Dude is fucking delusional for sure I'm just trying to figure out where we could find more talent. Not the draft cuz we only pick white guys Is Kevin love still on the table? Bring him home Dude lets swing for the fucking fence! Anthony Davis! Hahahah dude with what fucking assets You're gonna give spaceman a heart attack from laughter All the best ones CJ, Collins, Simons If Boston isnt gonna put Tatum on the table do they really have a better package? Jaylen brown, Hayward, Rozier and a couple firsts? Idk Theyre not gonna trade brown and Hayward dude Its Danny ainge He got Kyrie for fucking spare change Portlands best package is better than the Lakers best, I know that much True but AD is a generational talent And all 3 of those guys are coming off the bench! He's gonna lose rozier anyway Can't pay him And brown and Hayward are marginalized with Tatum and kyrie taking so many shots I suppose, but they cant do that until the summer anyway. They wont trade AD but if I want an established borderline star and some high potential assets, Portland package is right there Non Blazers folks were even saying the package isnt that bad New Orleans could make a run at Zion if they move AD before the deadline But mostly, Neil is a pussy and would never do it Yeah every conversation ends there let's be honest. Neil ain't doing shit Does AD need to resign first to get his money? Reportedly, he doesnt care about the extra money Uh huh Same same So technically yes? They say no player has turned down the super max, but I feel like Kawhi and boogie both did. They demanded trades before it was offered but I'm sure they would have got it We grabbing drinks after the game tonight or we just watching? Were watching it at a bar... Right right right Ill Uber ? Oh baby look at that Vlipsy Four of us? I believe so??? https://twitter.com/jga41agher/status/1081361830885249025?s=12 I'm so glad we kept CJ over PG! God CJ is such trash Would it kill him to drive to the basket like, once? Whole defense is in a scramble and he pulls up for that Right He's had two of those now this year and bricked them both. Bad decision on that one but he still had a clean look The pitch forks are out for a CJ trade. He's gotten consistently worse each of the last 3 years https://twitter.com/natalimarmion/status/1081355369085992960?s=21 ^ Next JCSL event https://twitter.com/notoriousohm/status/1081448550045630464?s=21 This is nuts Remember when he was detained on his birthday Someone is gonna make a helluva movie about this Michael Bay hopefully Lmaoo https://www.instagram.com/p/BsNTgwVFIVZ/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=1349hwhh5u5ow https://www.instagram.com/p/BsQm7_Kgwpc/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=sk0vn3ue5ylj Woah I hate Kawhi but that was low key savage The caption says its satire but its so great lmao Kawhi would be so much cooler if he actually said that Oh damn I misread I guess if that was true that would be a front page sports headline I wish more athletes were like that though Too much media training Besides jalen Ramsey ??????

Otherwise I have no idea why people love him so much Young, offensive minded Thats all it takes now He just got fired at lower tier college program, was gonna be the offensive coordinator at a pac 12 school and all the sudden Arizona thinks he'd be a great NFL head coach?? Lmao Everyone is trying to find Sean mcvay 2.0 Yeah thats just not a thing Hes working 5 years of Sean McKay so obviously hes gonna have revolutionary ideas Yeah, I think the Mahomes thing is a factor just like patriots assistants always getting hired even tho most never make it Sean McVay farted near him 4 years ago, lets hire him! The fuck is in the water in Arizona? "Idk Bob, If you squint hard he kinda looks like McVay" You're hired! KNICKSTAPE +17.5 tonight! I believe! Im over here licking my wounds after a couple bad weeks of football betting. This might be my ticket back in! Its second of a back to back but theyre a young team Shouldnt be an issue ? I thought Bruce arians retired Well he just unretired Hes from Louisiana right? I guess Florida is more like that than Arizona PA Ahhhhh For some reason I thought he was southern Hes the kind of guy who IS southern but isnt I just put 10 down on the Knicks which for me is basically a rack in bovada dollars The Knicks with the points is the official team of the Superliga Knicks with **double digit points** Knicks +6.5 at lakers started this wave Gundy my beak is wet on this Knicks game as well Lfg God the warriors are such bitches https://twitter.com/markg_medina/status/1082785888856231936?s=21 So basically they're trying to see if Cleveland helped him out by signing a offer sheet GS wouldn't match, then cutting him before contracts guarantee so that Cleveland is on the hook for nothing and McCaw can sign where he pleases? Yes, basically theyre trying to find out if the entire scenario was planned out before hand. And if it was, the Cavs might lose their first round pick when they have the worst record in the league All because GSW is snitching Why would Cleveland even risk that tho? What did they gain. A middle finger to the warriors? Eh fuck Dan Gilbert But yeah fuck the warriors and their bitch ass snitches Wow GSW is so fucking soft for being so stacked its ridiculous Yeah I mean obviously fuck DG but GSW being such a bitch about Pat fucking McCaw is so ridiculous Yeah it's not like they needed him ? She the actual fuck up Meyers best not be encroaching on my childhood now too Black Lego Meyers, the patron saint of the Superliga The best part is how it looks more like Dame or CJ and they just put Meyers name on it ?????? No way the NBA takes their first rounder Silver wont do that I dont think I can stress enough that were talking about Patrick McCaw... But also a potential first rounder Theres no way silver will do that Not when Lebron is outwardly tempering Itll be a fine THJ 3 point play GREAT start for KNICKSTAPE Seeing Holmes & Watson at $5 movie night. Pray for me Dont pray for mark pray for Nerlens That shit looked bad Prob similar experiences ? https://twitter.com/steven_lebron/status/1082847216534867973?s=21 KNICKSTAPE in trouble Shit Update: Sherlock & Watson is HOT garbage Need a quick 12-0 run Damn 92 Finals Rematch tonight.

Ed Sheeran I think we gonna find a new song lol Maybe like a Lil Uzi vert song https://twitter.com/totalprosports/status/1083068146175627266?s=21 Lol Meek Mill probably My latest trade idea that Neil would never do: CJ to Philly for Butler and a 1st Butlers value might be that bad where we can get them to attach draft compensation I'd do that in a heartbeat Too bad Neil is asleep at the wheel. Has anyone even seen him recently? Does he even go to games anymore? They get two more years of CJ guaranteed and hes not a headcase Seems more than fair to ask for draft picks Also Dame is an adult Jimmy has been bullying kids his last two stops Would you do it for jimmy + fultz CJ is so bad. We need him outta here asap Fultz makes a lot of fucking money man CJ is basically Lou Williams I would rather have a pick tbh, I feel bad for the kid Yah I agree but would you do it If I got a second round pick on top of it yes Straight up no I would rather rid ourselves of all our picks to ensure we have players that dont go straight to the G-league Haha oh man chad hes no on the same level as Lou Williams but I get the sentiment ? Omg Did you make this? https://twitter.com/fredkatz/status/1083163250274062339?s=21 Its time Jimmy 2 PDX? Haha I did not Its great tho ?

Meyers just chucked it up to nobody? Kyler Murray to the Kards Calabro making couch st. jokes and Im here for it lol Damn I missed it Ok heres a trade proposal for you guys We send CJ and either Swanigan or Wade to NOLA We get Julius Randle, Tim Frazier, Solomon Hills expiring and a pick If were talking a first I could be into it Yeah def a first We get two years of a physical PF that gets boards and buckets, plus Dame and Tim are reunited. We get off some money and a first rd. pick. NOLA convinces AD theyre serious about winning and keep him. NOLA still doesnt have a legit PG but thats their problem. Lmao Brooke is interviewing Nat Borchers in his seat. He started talking about Ruby Jewel ice cream and the two fat women in front of him turned around to hear more Lololol Meyers Red Bull dunk of the game again All dunks matter Could we swap Solomon hill for etwaun Moore? He's kinda nice Redbull has to be so pissed about that hahaha He wouldnt play much with CJ anyway I was more interested in Hills expiring contract But I guess in theory yeah Yeah i feel that Randle is a beast I love Julius Randle Especially at 2 years $8MM Lol bruce arians is gonna build around Jameis? https://www.instagram.com/p/BsdgQb_gd4J/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=jrxmmv3s1a5t Yikes Oh my god That was fucking terrible That video alone might cost Dame the all star bid Also why are we pushing CJ so hard? Nurk has been our 2nd best player this year What year is this I saw better napoleon dynamite interpretations at Anchor Splash 2010 Also does Myers get a participation trophy for this shit or something? Get the fuck out of here. Guaranteed meyers was the only one who volunteered for it Yeah if Im Nurk Im like fuck yall Vote for me Haha Dubov you're totally right What a fucking loser CJs PPG, APG, RPG, 3P% are all down this season. Why the fuck would anybody vote for him? Cool dance videos are up Blazers social really doing a number today https://twitter.com/trailblazers/status/1083427050956812289?s=21 You guys wanna know something depressing? Next season Meyers will be tied for 6th longest tenure in Trail Blazers history GOD FUCKING DAMMIT ? only 1 more year. That Sabas season total shouldve been way higher smh At least we were blessed with 8 seasons of the vanilla gorilla Pryzbilla? You know it Great season to playoff ratio there for Pryz and Outlaw Fucking Travis Outlaw! Travis outlaw was Meyers before Meyers Our top three almost rocking that 100% styles He was a great addition to the team shortly after the Jail Blazer era though in my opinion Hung on for 7 seasons. All we talked about was his "potential". Then he leaves the blazers and can't even make another NBA team aka he never should have been on our team based solely on his name Should we see if I can get blocked by Meyers on insta this morning? HEY I will not hear this Troutlaw slander GTFO here He is the pride of Starkville, Mississippi who always brought a great attitude to the facility Plus he hit a game winner at Memphis that one time And delivered a sensational postgame interview afterward He was still more inconsistent than my penis after drinking whiskey All I hear is Callahan right now Could barely understand him rambling now due to the fat dip he has in.

Lmaoooo First round pick for Jordan Clarkson is the funniest shit Ive ever heard in my life @spaceman checking out that r Kelly doc? ?

Fuhhhhh See u in the finals pussies ? Some sensational defense being played in this tnt game ?? PG honestly made an amazing steal to save the game for OKC Westbrook has 21 assists I just got home so I missed the rest of it 130-130 after regulation is silly Oh yeah I know lol Spurs made their first 14 3s Cant believe DeRozan missed that last shot I can sadly. Story of his career lol lol good point Oh shit partys over for LaMarcus Career high for Cams favorite player He went off after Adams got hurt lol the people in San Antonio as so stereotypical. Theres one dude in a cowboy hat, another in a Budweiser hoodie ?????? PATTY! Portlands own Jerami Grant! this game is sick. Wish I couldve watched from the jump I only watched from the 4th on Oh sweet Jesus Steven Adams That was dumb by DeRozan. Dont wave off your screen against the best defender on the floor. Dubov finally giving me a superliga challenge So dumb Dude Brock we are both injury riddled So frustrating Yah uncharted waters for the champ every time I look at my phone Im like wait why is this guy out now Yeah this season has been frustrating lol Jerami Grant balling in concords 50 ??

Its 3 levels lol It has everything I have its cool. Lack of blazers product tho ? I had the teal one growing up. Biggest regret giving that one away Miami Vice jersey time?? I had the teal one too, but it was reversible and had the black MJ bull jersey on the other side I was thinking a jersey But they didnt have Richardson Brutal Winslow is ballin now I actually wanna buy a Will Barton city edition nuggets jersey They brought back the rainbow logo for that Gundy how reliable is sporting news with rumors? If you say very, I'm gonna jump off a bridge They almost never get anything right Ok good I'll back away from the ledge now Im not gonna say that on Twitter Lol yeah I feel that But that Deveney dude never gets things right A first for Jeremy Lin would be my final straw He also said Vonleh could fetch a first from a contender.

He gets paid 11mil... and Meyers gets 10 ?? Ohh and Evan gets like 16??? Yeah his contract is a fucking steal The fact that hes become this good after getting a contract is nuts This is exactly what bob whitsitt had in mind when he traded jermaine. He was playing the long game. RIP dale Davis Anyone want any lines today for nfl ????????

They are really not pressing hard enough Damn KAT went for 27 and 27 Wow Cowboys are major homies for kicking this xp LETS GO Sorry guys had to go silent for the game Thank you Gundy The best part of all this is that Jason Garrett is going to keep his job and we will continue not having to ever take the cowboys seriously How do you not go for two there lol the fuck are the suns doing beating the nugs? Do they not want Zion? Or kick onside. Mind boggling Brock we are in a tight one Go get him Dubov Will B coming back is niceee Tom is the GOAT Chargers +4.5 TDs looking good still O shit I didnt see that but I think the pats will win by 5 still ? ?

Is this the twilight zone Can we please get the rock to Seth curry https://twitter.com/gameofthrones/status/1084631184804433921?s=21 Meyers comes in, immediate offensive foul Loses Jokic on next play, open 3 Jesus God Jokic is clowning Meyers so hard rn Lol wow bailout Layman actually doing shit Calabro is heated lmao Guys I need help. Im at the stage of being so hungry I cant decide what I want. Should I get pizza, Thai, bi bim bop, or a burger? Thai Malik Beasley and Will Barton killing us tonight and Aaron afflalo ain't even in the league anymore smh. Great trade Neil It's getting rough ..... Thai probably tonight seems like a red curry night This game is so tight Two best teams in the west That was terrible late game management by terry Yeah gotta give yourself some time Not fouling with 27 left means you need to know for certain youre going to get the rebound How so? I thought we played it perfectly. Just shitty Defense and no box out by Aminu Extend the game! The two for one with 30 seconds left outta the timeout was perfect His best case scenario was getting a board 70 feet from the basket with 3 seconds left lol Dude if Aminu grabbed that board we have the ball with 4 seconds left. Inbounding from half court. Down by 1 We had a timeout Even that isnt ideal. Why wouldnt you play the clock game and extend? 27 seconds is a terrible amount of time left to let the clock run I mean I guess you could do that but is down 3 with 24 seconds left really that much better? And on top of that the sideline play they ran for a 40 footer was predictable and expected I would rather have 24 seconds left Then you have to go quick 2 and play a free throw game or go for 3, then get a stop for OT Yeah but if we got the rebound we wouldn't have had to run that shitty play for a 3. Now you're down 1 and they have to guard the paint as well True on the rebound. Maybe Im just so jaded from watching my 6th graders give up 100 offensive rebounds this weekend that I have no faith in the boards. Or experiencing night terrors from The Jordan Bell rebounding fiasco in the final four Very likely Starting True Detective S3. Hopefully the detectives can find Neil Olshey since he disappeared. Time saving technique I just heard You can turn blazers games off after 3 quarters
 26-0 after leading going into the fourth 0-18 after trailing Florida Man https://twitter.com/bso/status/1084270793595469824?s=12 Yo boys 5-Feb Zers heat Whos in!?

Solid ye reference Bunky Hahaha wait trump actually bought Clemson Wendy's for dinner. I thought he was joking. Or that someone would talk him out of that Wow he finally came through on one of his promisses ? Wait what why did he do that follow up questions: 1) did he use tax payer money? Or did Mexico pay for this too? And 2) why not chick-fil-a? 3) is this an NCAA violation? Apparently he paid for it out of his own pocket, because since he shutdown the government the entire WH catering staff is furloughed So naturally he chose the cheapest food possible Lol what a cocksucker Who was the unpaid staffer that had to go pick up all that Wendys? Yeah how did he not at least choose chick fil a If the WH cooking staff is furloughed what has he been eating? Taco Bowls from Trump tower? Bro he doesnt eat the WH food anyway He eats buckets of KFC And mcdonalds Piece of shit Yeah Dubov is dropping nothing but facts. Trump eats fast food 24/7 Or if he splurges, a well done steak with ketchup Not even joking WHAT KIND OF PSYCHOPATH EATS A WELL DONE STEAK?! https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.businessinsider.com/how-presidents-eat-steak-2018-2 Do you guys think were ever going to have a vegan president?

Need something quick? Build your family a wall of Big Macs. Now only 2 for $5 Yeah maybe Wendys has a play here but McDs has no reason to Prepared by but not paid for by Mexicans I feel like people want to touch this about as much as a bacon maple chicken sandwich. (They dont) Can you imagine if he had bought them Taco Bell. The fucking optics wouldve been amazing. GO FOR 2! Dabo Swinney you just won the National Championship by dominating Alabama ! Which 2 McDonalds delicacies will you devour next? ?????? Laura Loomer fucking sucks. This bitch is really advocating for the need for a border wall by jumping over the wall that surrounds Pelosis house to set up on her lawn. As an aside: its hilarious how shitty the wall prototypes are too. NBC news showed a saw cuts right through all of them lol https://twitter.com/kicksdeals/status/1085015011091570688?s=21 Shumpert about to catch hands from Terry This is not an enjoyable game of basketball. But I love that Shumpert thinks hes good enough to talk trash. Super cute. Damn I just noticed Jim Boeheim pissed himself Legendary Dude what a man Im sure its gotta do with prostate cancer stuff but also how fucking legendary Too fucking busy to piss The task at hand was just too important https://twitter.com/nbaontnt/status/1085030330048729089?s=12 joe ingles is my daddy A random conference game in fucking January was too important ? Why are we fucking losing to Sacramento We had a brutal game last night CJ is sure showing his chops as a 2nd option on a contender tonight 2-13 baby! Alright time to turn off the game Zach also getting outscored by not 1, but both guys we traded for him Turn on Fyre Fraud instead Someone gotta hook me up with Hulu so I can watch that That ain't it chief Get Aminu all the fucking way outta here God CJ is a ghost Who that So fucking trash. And we're paying his bitch ass more than Giannis Sick transition step back jumper Down 6 Not like transition is an opportunity to attack the basket Smh fuck me Jesus Christ THE STREAK CONTINUES! Dude CJ is a cancer can we please trade his ass What could we even get for him right now? Bob Covington? lol I wish RoCo is better God that's depressing Olshey hung on so long we literally can't trade him now https://twitter.com/chold/status/1085048386481414144?s=12 This is so weird Might get the rarest of Terry's tonight I hope terry just drags him in post game https://twitter.com/mashable/status/1085055960652136450?s=12 fuck that. if Im high AF walking through Fred Meyer and I turn the corner to find one of these things Im gonna lose my shit https://twitter.com/jamiehudsonnbcs/status/1085058847448780800?s=21 Boys there are hella cheap tix to the nw That feb weekend Before the blazers heat game Who will be around? Im planning on being in town. Its Super Bowl weekend I get back from Atlanta on the 4th. Dont know my February practice schedule yet so Im tbd on the game. Damn whats going on in Atlanta? Super Bowl Whoa No shit? Howd you manage that? Maroon 5!!!! I cant believe Adam invited you! lol Im going for work. I wont be at the game, just on the ground to #disrupt the city with some sick #brandactivations Ahahahaha Dont rock the boat too hard Still a sweet deal lol I dont think our plan is going to rock much of anything Atlanta is one of this countrys finest cities But Im excited to eat well for 9 days for free I love Atlanta Unfortunately the Hawks are on a lengthy road trip. But Im probably gonna go to UNC at GT ?Outstanding copywriting, Alaska. ???? Wow well done What do you guys think of the Adapt BBs? The laceless shoes? How much are they? They look cool imo I cant afford them but theyre sick lol Theyre like $350 I think My son is the face of the campaign Is your son Jayson Tatum? LUKA Tatum is a supporting character Oh shit my b Lol It was supposed to be Tatum originally but the Celtics were being bitches Luka better be an all star Congrats Dubov on the baby Oh wow Ya I cant afford them haha. Jordan Bells promoting them too They look like a running shoe and a basketball shoe fell in love, then fucked. Then 18 years later that baby and a slip on cross trainer fell in love and fucked. Dubov was this what they announced on Twitch today? Yep What was the reasoning there? Twitchies dont work out Not sure what the objective, but I would disagree with that statement in general. Streamers might be less inclined to exercise, but people who watch the streams probably do. Every kid I coach watches shit on Twitch and they all play multiple sports. Yeah thats a fair point Less stereotyping in 2019! Gamers also like swag Oh I am aware from my taco bell days fucking savages ? What do you guys think? I'd do it But id also trade CJ for Dubov's middle schoolers I would do it but I dont think the magic would Simmons & Simons on the same team would hurt my brain I also think Aaron Gordon has a resurgence coming if hes able to get on a better team. Aaron Gordon is the 4 of the future I like it Yo can I get heat +8.5 @ bucks tonight? Dame, Ross, Aminu, Gordon, Nurk is a starting 5 I can work with Ross has been hoopin this year too ET, Seth, Stauskas, Simmons, ZC second unit Then maybe at halftime of a 76ers game, we could try to swap Simmons and Simmons. Nobody will notice Ian I want no part of that But I might follow you on bovada Burger King did a funny at least https://twitter.com/burgerking/status/1085213382192627717?s=12 Look, I get people love their football teams and all that. Its cute and shit. But if its -1 degree outside, why the fuck wouldnt you stay home and watch on TV inside the comfort of your warm trailer? What's great too is Trump can't even help himself with lying about fucking hamburgers. He said he bought 300 yesterday, now today he said he bought 1,000 lmao. Weird flex dude Dubov have you listened to American Fiasco? Its a podcast about the 98 us soccer team By rog Bennett I have. Its very good. I love Rog. God its so dope I just got to the John Harkes/Wynalda part Oh shit lol So crazy! Could you imagine with the Internet??? ? Did the blazers defeat the Sacramento kings last night!? Does the Miami Heat have a better record than the Sacramento Kings?! They will tonight after the pound Milwaukee! Jordan Bell is a Nike Adapt BB guy! Who do you guys think will be in the rising stars game? Zion Lol Alex Dubov But really, Kevin Knox, Ayton, Trae Jaren Jackson Luka obviously Ok help me out though. For World so far Ive got: Frankie Smokes, Bogdan Bogdanovich, Dillon Brooks, Markkanen, OG, Ayton Fox, Kuzma Is Luka gonna be in it if hes int he real all star game? Dame was if I recall Do we think Donovan Mitchell would do it? Dillon Brooks is out for the year sadly I think so Simmons too What about Jarrett Allen, Bam Adebayo, Wendell Carter, Monte Morris Allen for sure Carter probably too, Morris I think wont get in over Lonzo John Collins
Kyle Kuzma
Donovan Mitchell
DeAaron Fox
Jarrett Allen
Bam Adebayo
Lonzo Ball
Trae Young
Landry Shamet
Kevin Knox
Jaren Jackson Jr.
Wendell Carter Jr Thats 12. Gotta cut two. Wendell and bam You think Shamet is in? I'm so glad our 3 first round picks made that list.... Frank Ntilikina
Bogdan Bogdanovic 
Lauri Markkanen
OG Anunoby
DeAndre Ayton
Luka Doncic 
Ben Simmons
This is seven. Need three more. ??And then thoughts on these rosters? Shamet I think should be in over those guys He plays real minutes for a good team Is Shamet not foreign? I would put Dame over Klay I also dont think Adams makes it. I think LaMarcus or derozan go over him Shamet is from Kansas City Lol okay so thats a no Elie Okobo from Phoenix? Hes French oh good call Man international is harder than I thought Yeah it is Oh dude Kurcus For the Nets Thats not how its spelled but he plays and is decent This guy Dubov you don't got Dame in the all star game??? Lol wtf Lol do you chad? ? Oh yeah that guy fucks Lol duh Dame is going for 26/6/5 Doncic might not make it. No way rose makes it Im just looking at fan vote And I'm with Gundy on Adams. I think LaMarcus or Derozan over him Obviously have no idea what the coaches are gonna vote Fan vote is only for starters tho Or players And even then it's only 50% Media and players make up the rest Derrick Rose had enough votes to be a starter, didnt he? And if you don't make starters, the bench is 100% coaches pick I believe Nah fan votes is only 50% Ah gotcha He did but apparently they do it by ranks and not margin of votes Well then yeah get D Rose all the fucking way outta here Harden will at least tie him Gotcha who would you say are your west starters? There is a chance he will make it but if hes not a starter its not happening To me its gotta be LBJ, Curry, Harden, PG, Luka wait sorry Not luka AD Steph, Harden, LeBron, PG and KD Yeah AD works too I could flip a coin between those guys I feel like coaches/players would give it to AD Probably, nobody likes kd Does Bill Simmons get a vote? ?This is my best guess. I could swap Harris for Derozan, Towns or Doncic easily Lol wait KAT isnt even on the nba.com article list. How did I forget about him Harris is a good one But man As a fan I cant put him in over Luka Clippers record be damned Dubovs We forgot one of our sons Cedi!!! Id put him above okobo Well we only have 9 right now so Ill add Cedi God I respect Jokic so much for being such a baller with man boobs https://www.instagram.com/p/Bsq-hGeAiMs/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=140k3ahqeomd6 Hes doing it for dudes with man boobs everywhere and we appreciate it Its a beautiful thing Representation is so important Im finally feeling seen. Sco Heat +8.5! Lol u had to jinx it bro Its early 8.5 still within reach God the heat did it again with Derrick Jones Jr Okay never mind its over All the games tonight have been basura Did the heat win ? Theyre down by a lot at half Damn prayers up ?? Talk shit get hit The heat poop their pants tonight or what ? Or Milwaukee (white metropolis) just rolling? Milwaukee is booming They just made everything when I was watching https://twitter.com/joelembiid/status/1085375057831055360?s=21 https://twitter.com/flasportsbuzz/status/1085379380203962368?s=21 Is he going to get a machete named patience ? Gundy explain the Embiid post por favor Hes referencing the Woj story from preseason where Jimmy beat the Wolves starters with the third stringers Lol Neil should give up a first for TJ aware en *Warren Niel should wake his ass up and clock in for once. As anybody even seen him Hurts is transferring to OU. Interesting Watch him win them another heisman https://sports.yahoo.com/leaked-nba-star-game-jerseys-211258652.html I dont believe it but someone please confirm Jordan is responsible for these I think Dubov would know better Dubov get your mans If it wasn't a shameless money grab to create and sell another stupid ass Jersey, the nba would do what's right and go back to this ? Always been a fan of these: ? Ugly as fuck but I love them Wearing your own jersey will always be the best in my eyes. I remember being so hyped seeing Rasheed rocking the pinwheel with the best players in the league ? These clean too Basically they could stop with the minimalist bullshit and give it an honest try Like not even a single nod to the host city? I have no idea if those are actually them, but I do remember Ashley saying they werent great Im with you Chad, I loved the team jerseys They look a lot like last years just with a red trim If youre gonna design an All-Star specific jersey to sell more, you gotta make them something people actually want to buy lmao Wow I just realized that the ASG in Charlotte is on MJs birthday... MJs birthday is the marquee event of All-Star weekend like every year but in his hometown its gonna be epic Tequila Jordan coming out strong Hopefully he gets some clothes that fit for his birthday ? ?Holy shit I have a new favorite player God I love Ingles I'm bringing that line to my local pickup game Jordans Corneas gonna be extra mustard that weekend ? https://twitter.com/dame_lillard/status/1085662633879977984?s=21 Didn't peg dame for a Soulja fan Maybe he forwarded him an email? That could be what he means Dude Soulja is a legend First artist to monetize the internet Hes a pioneee https://twitter.com/kpelton/status/1085611551803957248?s=21 Dame $ Chaadddd ?? Zach Lowe says he expects Neil to be aggressive at the deadline Pffft Zach Lowe expects Neil to be aggressive at the deadline after talking to Neil Hahaha I've lost all hope Brock I'm gonna go by past actions. When was the last time olshey made a meaningful trade? Plumlee for Nurk? Sounds like Dame is out tonight Good thing CJ is aces baby! Hope you all picked up Seth curry in daily fantasy CJ gonna go 6-22 and be our third leading scorer tonight https://www.instagram.com/p/Bst_DkbBkvM/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=1likyfwmjo0m3 Wish we would've had a draft pick high enough to nab JA Apparently Dame is available But hes not warming up He doesnt need to warm up Lmao this 0% alcohol Heineken ad is so fucking bad It has no alcohol so you can drink it at work! Honestly though Theres this account guy at work Who rocks this water bottle That just looks like a bud light can Like a tall boy lmao I love it so much I mean, a tall boy of bud light is water so It makes me so happy seeing him use it with confidence early in the am lmao Lamar is explaining ayy bay bay by hurricane Chris to calabro and Im dying https://twitter.com/mzavagno11/status/1085746564448940032?s=21 Kobe shed a single tear Let's trade Layman while his stock his high https://www.instagram.com/p/BsuSk4DFrrt/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=1r1jzi70l157k Classic Meyers follower just like the Napoleon video https://twitter.com/aznallin007/status/1085776461456265216?s=21 Lmao wtf ? 120 pints @ keep your glass night What do you guys think of CJ for Aaron Gordon + Ross Do it Hardens FGA the last 8 games: 34, 33, 32, 24, 30, 18, 35, 32 As Kai Ruderian once told me: Great shooters keep shooting. Similar to his quote that great students keep taking classes You cant be a master of anything until you do it for 10,000 hours Thats a lot of hrs of sex Wow great joke Houman You still have 9,999.9 hrs to go Hoomie Well at least Ive had 10 min of it New John wick trailer ?? https://twitter.com/windhorstespn/status/1085948809992130560?s=21 Lol wut That sounds like a disaster waiting to happen "I touched the ball coach. It's their ball" Lol that commercial sucked. I would bench a kid for that. Lmaooooo I completely forgot about this Shoutout to the ATL strip clubs for banding together and convincing city council to let them be open on Super Bowl Sunday AND open an hour later each night that week. Its absolutely beautiful what can be accomplished when a community comes together After further review - he didnt even touch it https://youtu.be/vOhn6eO3Wds Lol I went to magic city once How did we never hear about this until now I was with Mitch! Honestly it wasnt that special Oh wow lmaooo I watched a documentary on the lemon pepper wing, apparently magic city has good ones Wait what is this documentary I would watch that It was on First We Feast Just google it Lol found it. Definitely gonna watch this later. Hell yeah, thats a culinary bucket list thing for me for sure. Just getting lemon pepper wings in Atlanta lmao Boban in John wick 3 Gordon combines the ball skills of Turner with the size and athleticism of Al-Farouq Aminu, and even that might be underselling just how athletic he is. Uhh yeah, ya think? We doubt Dana every year. Its ridiculous that he fucking scoffs at us every time we do it SCO WOO lmao ok lets cool the jets we have a very long way to go with this team. really good win but Bill Walton started off the game by saying its a disgrace Dana isnt in the HOF Dana is the best coach in the pac 12 Hes also amidst learning how to coach one and dones, which even Coach K struggled with That was like their 5th loss at home in like 6 years so Id say thats a big win It is a big win. The ducks should be 3-1 right now in the pac in terms of how theyve played. Were gonna have to win the P12 Tourney regardless. I know the seasons early but without a clear favorite I think we can do it if we continue to play like that Finishing in top 4 will be key Their record should be exactly how many wins and losses they have. I agree its a strong win and its anybodys conference But unless we win the conference tournament were not getting in the dance There isnt a single good team in this conference so hopefully Dana can keep them on track I mean if they win the reg season itll be a lot easier I truly still think they can based off this game. Itll be interesting to see if they can back it up against a good ASU team. Arizona sweeps are hard to come by but I think theyll have a good shot. Nice to have a competitive OSU for teams to have to get up for once too They talked about it at the end but for them to kill USC and then beat AZ on the road after blowing the UCLA game is pretty impressive. Last years team would have lost both of those ? ?Someone please explain 1 and 2 in East it's hurting my brain % vs GB? Gb is stupid Correct % better Winning percentage is the no. 1 I always have thought of GB as the defacto rankings thing cuz it's pretty much always same as % Really threw me off Is game back relevant at all? I use it in regular conversation or like on the podcast but its not as indicative as winning percentage So it doesn't do anything for playoff scenarios whatsoever Gb gets funky when youve played a different amount of games https://www.instagram.com/p/Bsy6h86HT4_/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=1bo0gldblby46 God damn Ferocious animal, friend of the pigeons It's a great episode Said his mom would give him weed and booze to go to sleep at 9 years old Also talks about doing the road which is a drug supposed to be way more intense than DMT Toad ** Mike Rice getting horny on main, we Stan a king https://twitter.com/mikerice6/status/1086475588699914240?s=21 Lmaoooo that's fucking amazing Of course the rockets are getting Faried Where's Neil at???

The fuck Jerry guys are key to the story tho, Frye hired them to do marketing I know Even if they do suck balls I guess he Hulu one is legit The Netflix one feels like a commercial for parts of it but it is nonetheless amazing If theyre key tot he story they shouldnt be producing the doc exposing it lol The Hulu one is basically the same thing I thought Yeah I know the connection but those guys who run fuck jerry are unoriginal pieces of shit who just try to make money off other peoples ideas Like just another side from people involved Both docs are good. I think I liked the Hulu one better cuz I watched it first. The Netflix one has more insight on the operation I felt and Ja Rule videos. But I will only remember the bj story from Netflix Apparently there is another one coming out too Omg the BJ story was fucking insane When is Michael Moore doing a fyre doc Crazy his mentor was the okc owner Oh wow I didnt even put 2+2 together on that The Netflix one was better produced too. Either way its pretty scary how powerful social media and influencers can be Are you saying social media and influencers have the ability to be... disruptive? VERY lol But thats not really new just interesting to get all the details on everything Isiah Thomas and Kevin McHale coming to my sons defense saying he is a soccer star and should not have been kicked out for kicking the ball TRIPLE DOUBLE FOR MY SON Is it on TV ? Reddit stream Are any games today televised ? NVM just saw 2 TNT games https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1087474151726682119?s=12 Hell yeah our greatest national treasure Bill Walton received a Sports Legacy Award today in Memphis Lol so the bulls have Jabari Parker exiled because he was a black hole on offense and played zero D, and they think Carmelo will fit? Theyre waiving him Why the trade then? Trade exception for Chicago? Cash considerations The bulls are a Ponzi scheme Oh good call. Jerry loves him some extra cash See Jordan Bell Theyre an atm for the white Sox Pretty sad that two of the premier franchises in the nba are run by complete ass hats Anyone watch the new epi or crashing? Not yet What Portland bros are going to WWE RAW on feb 4th? Ill catch up on shows when Im black, someone please tell me that the new true detective is at least decent I know thats a typo but Im imagining black mark and its hilarious Lolololololol True Detective has been pretty good Cam! Will you be in Portland that week? The heat blazers game is the 5th Mark? :( No I wont be unfortunately. I dont know when the next time Ill be in Portland will be. Oh lol I thought that meant you were going up Im in Portland as of the 3rd Nah I saw a commercial on WWE RAW and wanted to make sure none of Portland homies missed it. Ok u in mark? Its a weird feeling to have to be so stressed about the blazers potentially being down at the end of the third. Wow Layman Nurk on quadruple double watch I'm talking myself into Layman being kinda good You not the only one Im in space just get the cheap tickets Im low on discretionary funds at the moment CJ dropping the grenade on Seth then chewing him out for the shot clock violation ?? Some bullshit on CJ lmao Dude Meyers and layman CJ fucking sucks bro. I'm so out on him And so in on Layman omg Hey guys remember when we passed on Donovan Mitchell? Can't remember if we've covered this or not I uttered a nice remark involving Meyers today... But hey we needed another big to sit on the bench in crunch time obviously Oh God crunch time Meyers ? Wtf just happened What a shitty call How do u say suck it from the back in Australian ???? Not tonight Joe Trade cj. Build around dame and Layman God layman is gonna get so paid next summer By someone else Nurk is no joke our 2nd best player now Man George Bush was a piece of shit But he dodged the fuck out of that shoe Sneaky athletic president Very agile. Dodged the draft like a pro. I know Totally unfazed Pretty remarkable throwing too So nimble That man Had dodged a shoe before If you can Dodge a wrench you can Dodge a shoe Trumps a dodger too God I hope we show up tonight Im hoping Brock shows up vs DeHaan this week Dehaan already choked Missed Monday lineups after talking a big game a few weeks ago Hes also busy conspiring with his wife on how to freeze bunk out of the ATS finale Ya once the king went down I really started mailing it in Maybe next year boys #collusion Brock do you wanna go to the zers heat game? Yah Nice Im in Ian Dope ? Shoot me Isaac Ropp has a good thread today Im in space Sage is a heat fan. They have a very immature bandwagon fan base. https://twitter.com/iropp/status/1087773957757882370?s=21 You say continuity, I say complacency. Is Isaac Ropp tweeting from the drunk tank? Lmaooo damn Hell yeah Want me to get here a lil baby heat outfit from the nba store? Miami Vice jersey Bro kd wakes up in a cold sweat every night Freaked out about the blazers continuity Philly is memeing ! ? Sorry boys had to lol foh clay Damn Ropp is dropping straight knowledge this morning. That sums up my thoughts exactly Ropp is great, he also is SO negative normally its hard to read/listen to his Blazer takes Hes just got such an axe to grind, but I havent read this new stuff yet I am sure he makes good points. I feel that. Nothing in that thread was false tho Yeah hard to disagree with that thread He just spit facts Glorified scout was a dagger Glorified scout is a great way to describe olshey He finds underrated players on the scrap heap but is clearly a Fucking terrible negotiator And let's his "eye for talent" tie him to his own picks too easily and get in the way of the business side when a trade should be made https://www.instagram.com/p/Bs8kGYTgBSE/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=3d4zoroyargi I mean, I get why he doesnt have LeBron as a starter Hes been out so long Yeah same. Only uneducated fans are losing their minds about that Looks like solid picks to me. PG is ballin out this year. 27 points a game is a nuts Most he ever averaged in Indiana is 23.7 I understand what Lowe is saying there. But he strictly looks at a players on court performance. LeBron James is the face of the league. HEs gonna be a starter. In a perfect world, fans would have 0% of the vote and the players having he best season would be in but we dont live in that world. For sure. Lebron should start and will definitely start He will start even if he cant physically play Lol But the article is purely basketball based which is what's fun to read The Wizards are complete blind spot for me. Is Brad Beal really having an ASG starer caliber season? Yeah its a fun reality to live in Hes been really really good Yeah Beal has been a beast since Wall went down I think he's even had a couple 40 point triple doubles I would have argued even before wall went down that he was the better of the two ? Matty where did you find that photo of my lord and savior Big day for mariners fans Im finally reading this Quick piece Olshey, who declined to be interviewed, oh I bet he did I dont entirely buy the we cant attract talent to Portland thing anymore. Maybe 10 years ago. Its just cause Olshey doesnt get the city You really telling me that OKC is a more desirable destination than Portland? So he cant really sell it if he doesnt like it They managed to convince PG to choose OKC over LA. Portland is the #1 most moved to city in America the last 2 years Whats the biggest difference between OKC and Portland? Sam Presti. Where does SoWa fall on that list? Gotta be top 5 I feel like okc is so close to Texas though The difference is they sold Pg while he was inprosoned there 
 You gotta get a guy in house before you can brain wash him Okc never gets PG in FA otherwise I refuse to be apart of anything titled maga satire or not Yeah Im with you mark Exactly right. So trade for somebody, imprison them here and then sell them on overpriced coffee and farm to table dining. Show them the coolest natural wine bars in the city It really shouldnt take much SHEESH ?? Brock is 100% right Im not crazy enough to think well attract a FA. You have to swing for the fences and get the guy in house to pitch him. But olshey refuses to do so. Says it's "too risky" If we traded for PG I'm convinced Dame could have got him to resign as well too risky makes me so mad. Whats the alternative? Continue to be a middling team. Dudes got no balls. The NBA specifically put things in place to give teams an advantage when it comes time to resign players. Take advantage of it. These are all straight facts ? The fact that olshey thinks he can take the same exact team that got run off the floor in round 1 next year, and somehow tell people we're better from internal development... Really dude? You swapped Patty fastball for Stauskus and Napier for Seth Curry. Big fucking deal. We'll lose 4-1 now instead of 4-0 Literally everybody knows they just need to blitz Dame Like, if that series doesn't spur a change of personnel, wtf will? Sorry for the name change Mark -just wanted to get the feds to stop snooping in to see our hate for Meyers and Olshey WE WANT WHITSITT Olshey also runs us like a business. He's too buddy buddy with McGowan. I bet he wants to run an organization eventually and is angling towards running a profitable team as his calling card Olshey is just bidding his time for the chance to run the Knicks or the Lakers Thats it He doesnt wanna do anything to rock the boat Exactly. And Jody Allen being a passive owner helps his cause even more She's not gonna rock the boat either We need Bert Kolde to start throwing his weight around Everybody just out here to keep cashing checks We're so fucked O and Edgar Martinez > Bonds Dame is gonna be 34 before somebody finally grows some balls around here Unfortunately youre right chad He's likely gonna be the greatest blazer ever and we're completely squandering his prime ? Unreal ^ I want my GM to look like this How the fuck did Manny only get 22% https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1087860357626916864?s=21 Not surprising Too bad Memphis doesnt have anyone who would really help the blazers Would love the blazers to be part of a 3 team deal Nurk is better than Gasoline Gasol Lmao Dame mas (gasol)ina Lonzo Ball for Mike Conley who says no Wow I like that one Gundy Benefits both sides Uh doesnt he make like 32 mil next year KCP, Lonzo, Beasley and Lance for Conley works I mean they'd have to balance out money but those players would be the centerpiece Lance and Beasley in Memphis could be dangerous lol If they need us to take JaMychal Green off their hands... ? Win win win ?Further evidence Nurk is our #2 A lot of those names are dudes that are having good seasons But I wouldnt consider them ALL STARS And CJ didn't even make the list of pretty good guys lol Just put some bovada dollars on blazers +5 Cj sucks Cj wouldnt even make the list... the most inconsistent guy getting paid 23+ mil My point exactly hoomie Cj is ?? Ahh whoops My bad I wish you could like the name change Were spending a lot of energy just to stay in this game. Were gonna run outta gas, I think. If the zers are losing after 3 hammer that live ML Zion is doing Zion things vs. Jeff Capel aka the coach that dropped the bag for him to go to Duke Thats gotta be so bittersweet. Like yeah, I landed that recruit for Duke and I was totally right about him. Now hes kicking my ass at Pitt. Theyre also undefeated when they lead after 3 What a crazy fucking stat https://twitter.com/nba/status/1087896298303442945?s=12 Paula George sounds like a bitch Lol I got asked to interview today In KC Go chiefs? Harkless does not have it today Already deleted. What did it say ???? It was just a typo. Paula George instead of Paul George Omg !!! Gundy does Harkless ever have it? Last night he at least made his shots around the rim Did jim Rome tweet it ? CJ saw the group name change We gotta keep it now. if he keeps playing like this. Trade haekless or bench him Could be a turning point of the season Or change it to Neil Olshey is a coward and wont trade CJ superliga Harkless shouldnt be in the starting lineup We got 5 minutes to decide this game Look at our run in the past couple of games, was harkless playing or even starting? Nope? 
This is why terry stotts kinda needs to go, he has never known how to make adjustments, whether it be Reg season or playoffs OHHHH CJ! Hes a man of consistency Lmao Houman coming for everybodys head tonight Sorry just want harkless gone thats all I miss Ed. Almost voted him for all-star i miss him so much I mean I dont think theres ever been a blazers team I loved 1-15. Always gonna be dudes that dont quite fit or arent adding anything. But weve got some of those dudes starting or playing significant minutes lol So much agreement with all this right now That's why we can't take the next step. Harkless, Aminu, Layman would be great if they were 7-9 guys. But having two of those dudes starting cripples us ?Chad rn Dames missed two dunks this game Trade his ass TRADE EVERYBODY CLEAN HOUSE! Its almost spring! Meyers guarding PG is like watching a giraffe learn to walk Nvm he made that dunk keep him Welp thats all she wrote boys Trade everyone Who are these people who dont believe PG should be an all star starter? Also what a fucking luxury to have Dennis Schroeder as your backup PG. Sam Presti is a wizard. The streak lives Hope yall hammered! 16 steals? Fuuuuuck Dames agent https://twitter.com/jonesonthenba/status/1087913791935791105?s=21 Preaching to the fucking choir. We should have thrown the kitchen sink at Indiana Chad we offered 3 premium picks! ?? Hahaha I'm nit picking on this one, but Olshey shouldn't have swapped picks with the Cavs that year either. We had their 2018 pick and Neil swapped it for their 2017 pick so they could trade another first Man I feel like 2 picks in 2017 and 2 picks in 2018 is more valuable than 3 in one year. Indiana didn't want 3 picks the same year, what's the odds you even like 3 dudes in the first round Fucking crazy how good Indiana is rn lol Would you guys want Conley? Or gasol? No Y not? We have Dame and Nurk? You dont think dame and Conley Would work? Eh i wouldn't do it personally. Dame would have to play off the ball more and he's so damn good in the P&R Yah. Conley overrated cause the media likes him/feels bad for him https://twitter.com/stevemims_rg/status/1087872840420909056?s=12 Baseball! Gundy this was really for you Dude Richie Sexton woulda told him to fuck off Fuck Sexson He fucking sucked Richie Sexton is the Peter crouch of baseball (not a compliment) What is this about? https://www.instagram.com/p/Bs9ouQgB33O/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=1376i52842oq5 https://www.instagram.com/p/Bs9nJ5WBMH0/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=1hu0ekmlyu0cs Nvm https://twitter.com/lilbthebasedgod/status/1087991564939522048?s=21 Great company Oh fuck yeah - this is great news! The based god almost ruined Hardens career And he only forgave kd when he joined the warriors He is a testy one Hes blessed us in the past are we now double blessed or you think he just got lit and forgot ? Is it possible for the based god to curse Neil and bless the blazers at the same time? I dont think so He could curse meyers and then we release him May be worth cursing Neil now and then in 3 years when we are in the shitter he gets canned and we are on the road to a championship by the time our kids are in high school!

Well miss your ??takes Houman has been highly tepid lately and his effort is lacking Wait people legit dropping the liga? WOOOOOOW Terrible You think you know somebody Brock have we got an analytics wrap up recently? I'm curious what the most commonly used words or phrases are I'm guessing some combo of Meyers and pussy I did it last March so i was waiting for a year review Wait Im confused who left la liga? Oh legit I'll be anxiously waiting Colin was added then quickly bailed Who is Colin kaepernick? Yeah he took a stand Whoa whoa we don't just add outsiders Willy nilly Yeah I dont remember this being brought in front of the council I didnt know who it was until I checked my phone - running chat through my laptop I dont know who is saying what 95% of the time Who is the mother fucker that added him Ill kill them I think Gundys friend Terry is the only one that wouldnt need preapproval This is correct. Or of course dame dolla himself Or Kristen ledlow. The list stops at 3 Kristen is a dear friend of that chat Though I would also expand that list to include our namesake Joevan himself Ah yes that is an automatic add as well Dubov Wow we're more welcoming than I thought Someone should try getting ahold of catrons number and adding him in. Kid phe probably has it 
What about sandy What about our good friend mr 300 Terry? Dubov Ill let u take this one Scroll up? The dangers of chatting on your laptop ?? I cant keep up with this fucking chat Can we add sandy please? I cant find the recipe for a sakahara chicken anywhere online I also need to do some new years cleaning and her shitalottas seem like just the thing to help me release my bowels properly I just pretend Im eating her enchiladas and cinnamon rolls. That usually does the trick Real Hook approach. I like that Dubov I am going to Blue Ribbon Sports today to talk with John Jefferson Whoa for real? Im jealous you get to go to BRS before I do. I have a lot of friends that worked really hard on that. John Jefferson is the man Leaving work early cause fuck em You chatting with him about getting in at Nike? Gonna try - applied to be the AM on the Nike account here at Snap though so you might be my client soon Fingers crossed - also will be making regular trips up to Portland! Lol that would be sick Drinks on me Well, Snap. Thanks, Ev. I took that global social manager gig, btw. I start on the 11th New year new Dubov Dubov I didnt know u were a social bro too! Dare I say Dubov, 5.0? Wait still at Nike Dubov? Yeah but moving from North America to global Oh baby you gonna travel international? Rarely Do you get to meet Rihanna at least? You mean does Rihanna get to meet me? Possibly. Then this is a good promotion ? That's gonna be a no from me Really? Interesting Most people on Twitter hate it too But man, Conley and Dame??? I Just don't think Conley is that big a upgrade over cj And he's old and expensive and injured all the time We need a true 2 Thats a no for me as well We dont need 31 and 28 year old point guards Love Conley but hes not the answer. Especially at $30MM ?How bout something like this ZBo! Im in. CJ and Fox together could be really dangerous But doesnt Vivek LOVE buddy? You know Vivek really loves? STAUSKAS Yeah he does Like a son Buddy is fuckin killing it Yeah I dont think they give him up. His upside vs CJs and also the value theyre getting him at. Maybe vlade wants to go "win now mode" ? I like all those guys but Id rather be in the playoffs with Mike Conley than any of those dudes Conley is still elite, Gasol is the one has fallen off https://twitter.com/clutchpointsapp/status/1088923239957508096?s=12 ?And Kyrie just posted this They gonna reunite next year? Okay rain check That is not Kyries IG This year Chad ?? Walton too Would be NUTS Last weekend in New Orleans, gotta blow it out Also Conley is way better than CJ Come on Dude is an elite playoff performer Marginally And I hate CJ I'm not big on Conley or playing two PG's I just think Conley is a way better defender and a more elite offensive player Factor in his contract and age. I'll pass Also he has experience Hes 31! Hes got at least two more years Before he hits the wall I say fucking go for it The two PG's concerns me But I feel you We need to stop talking about potential and go for it at some point Functionally how different is it than CP3 and Harden? Defense? Harden is 6'6 Conley is a great defender! True I just have night terrors of the Suns 3 PG system Hes outplayed Chris Paul in the playoffs before And hes younger Also if you get temple and JaMychal you replace Evan turner with two 3/D guys Idk. I'm not sold lol Alright Its also kind of a Neil move Its unconventional which is the shit he fucking loves Let's be honest tho Sideline Neil ain't doing shit ?? Yeah Im just tired of seeing the blazers stand pat man Were like the raptors of getting to the 2nd round Instead of the conference finals I'm with you Like, that deal to me is a clear upgrade, even if its marginal Like, youre upgrading your third best player and maybe making it your 2nd best thats not nothing This is true We should have got PG. it was there for the taking Im down for the blazers to make any sort of attempt to change it. Conley would add some good swagger too Hed love playing with Meyers too https://twitter.com/cornnuts/status/1088622663973724161?s=21 Looks like they hired trillballins https://twitter.com/rivalsnation/status/1088997727873220608?s=21 Great trade Neil :( https://twitter.com/brandon_merano/status/1088952437111689216?s=21 Woah this could be crazy movie style police detective cover up shit One officer shot another office in chest, theyre spinning it as they were playing Russian roulette How do u prove / deny that if the one office is dead ? ????????

Fucking narcs. Finally watched the Hulu Fyre doc Insane Surprised Mark didnt pay to go Who is the groups Billy McFarland? Feels like something social chair Dylan would cook up Lololol Yes Dylan is absolutely our guy Idk Dehaans pinning was the closest to the fyre fest tho Dude chad I just remembered this Remember when we were living in that spot over the summer And some psychopath completely lost his mind And smashed up somebodies car Like smashed the windshield and everything That was nuts! Guys we had SigEp version of FYRE remember? It was the ninja rave Wait was that the weird beer hoodies thing? When they made that horrible video? And only like 10,000 townies showed up Wasnt Veema kinda like Steel credit card Does that video still exist? Didnt we basically get scammed with that too? Haha space yes I remember that vividly That guy was shirtless and shoeless. And he literally just two hand tomahawked a fucking windshield Shattered it instantly https://youtu.be/oA4_4cwaeus Man all the craziest shit happened in college And like I was so unfazed by it at the time Like if that happened now Id be freaked out for like a week Space remember when I thought weed was a gateway drug I was so concerned haha Lol were you not concerned about like the 5 other drugs we were doing at the time? Hahaha well once I gave in I was like fuck it give me all the drugs Dude is Ryan Allen bout to get another super bowl ring Yeah then get cut And no he isnt fuck off chad Go Rams I remember the first time I did coke Mitch stayed up all night and smoked a cigarette with a homeless guy by the train tracks And then Mitch showed me his gun Thats awesome Never forget that Rengel bought paper machete weed. And got robbed. All in the same night God you guys have the best stories Didnt Ian get hit by a car? I did get hit by a car Oh wow Ian did get hit by a car hahaha Dude six years is a p great run for a punter Fuck I think cam Juarez witnessed it Who was there for that? I know Mark was On one team Oh big dog was there Even if he does get cut I think Dylan saw it too Beer hoodie is the one where the stripper pissed turners bed Oh no! Wait didnt they offer to send the strippers back over to help clean up the house as repayment for like damages Not sure but he was crying about the 3000 thread count sheets he just got ?????? Man I didnt know it then But this is like my fav photo ever now ? From when the heat played the thunder CJ got a triple double last night and we havent traded him yet this is outrageous SELL HIGH DAMNIT Yo Can I bring a laptop into an nba game? Im just stuck with my backpack And I have knocks tickets tonight Pretty sure you cant but idk maybe New York is different Tell them youre media You write for jimmydolanisacheesedick.com Tell them your tickets are on your computer Maybe you can use on of those storage lockers like you always see in movies Tell them you're a blog boy You write for the ringer and you have an obscure podcast that explores the intersection between ineffecient offenses and Turkish politics Jeremy Renner and Ben Affleck brought 2 M16s into Fenway during The Town so you can probably get a laptop into MSG You could say youre brainstorming for Eddie 2: GA 2 GM Neil Olshey could be the villain Trubiscuit out here throwing the Pro Bowl, I love it Lol I love this chat Lolol who puts up 7 points in the fucking pro bowl ?KD is so sensitive lol ? Lol fucking 90 dollars a ticket to watch the most putrid lineup ever assembled Picture taken with your laptop? Ian Im watching there was a lets go hear chant *heat Fuck dude that injury sucks Yeah lots of d wade fans in the building Chinese couple sitting next to me going nuts lol Dude Im stoked to see D Wade In Portland Is he gonna jersey swap with Meyers? Evan Turner is Li-Ning ?????? Also we should get a final head count on that So we can snag tickets in bulk Or together I guess https://twitter.com/grantgoldberg/status/1089570658994929665?s=21 Seeing belichick in a suit and tie feels so unnatural It should be illegal for him to wear a suit https://twitter.com/ramsnfl/status/1089684977393065984?s=21 WELCOME TO ATLANTA WHERE THE PLAYAS PLAY https://www.instagram.com/p/BtKm2Gun2-z/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=1co5fnb7agu8k Even Altman flexing on the sideline these days Off-white sign a deal with big program coaches or something? ?Come on Neil Holy shit CJ and some firsts Lets fucking go! Cam its part of the coaches vs cancer fundraiser. All the basketball coaches wear sneakers and then auction them off to raise money for the ACS. So who do the lakers send to NOLA? KCP, Kuz, Rondo and a first? #NAME? First, Ingram and kcp Kuz is too good to give up Dude it's Anthony fucking Davis. Lakers gotta give up way more than that Dude its Houman Mitorabi Ohh and ball Thats a fair trade; ball, kcp Ingram and first Tbh Davis is gunna get traded to a team that hes not gunna sign with so theres basically only 6-7 teams. None of which can offer more than what the lakers can offer Hes gunna sign* KCP, Ingram, Kuzma and Rondo + a First Heeess backkkkkk ?? ?? ?? He said he would leave if we talk bad about the zers Or they can take our offer of CJ, Collins, Aminu and two firsts Dame has always said he would like to play with AD whenever asked about teaming with another all star Chad I do that deal fucking yesterday if Im Neil But its Neil so I know it wont even be on the table Oh for sure. Neil probably thinks CJ and AD are similarly talented "Look it doesn't make sense to mortgage the future for a guy who may be here for 18 months. That's not how you build a stable franchise in a small market" Triple double CJ has the highest trade value in months right now. Hes just getting started! CJ hasnt even scratched the surface of what hes capable of. - Neil, probably. After the Ed Davis trade I have come to realize locker room guys have immense value. Ive never heard Anthony Davis being referred to as a locker room guy - Sideline Olshey CJ, Aminu, Zach doesnt make the money work but if we also took Solomon Hills expiring off their hands.... ?Dame getting interviewed after sideline Olshey says we're gonna sit out the AD sweepstakes https://twitter.com/erik_skopil/status/1089726841286361088?s=12 Meyers never had this convo https://twitter.com/ba_turner/status/1089893568938860544?s=21 Zubac is actually good I wouldnt give up Davis if it involved kuzma That guy is legit the next bread of stars And we all know 2 superstars arent going to win a ship Houman Its Anthony Davis! I love Kuz too but Id just substitute Kuz for Ingram Theyre better off waiting and trying to sign Kris Middleton If they can get Ad now The thing is kuzma is signed for 3 more years at less than 2-3 mil/yr There isnt a better deal out there.... if they can manage to not include in the trade and keep him think about how much more cap space they would have... cause one AD and lebron take full contracts of 40 each that leaves barely any space You know what AD is. Hes a mega star. You have a hope of what Kuz could be, but no guarantee hell continue to develop to that level. Im a big kuz guy if you cant tell And I have a hard time believing hell ever become what AD currently is Kuz is really good! But you cant just get Anthony fucking Davis for some guys Yeah cmon Houman be realistic here. You gotta pay to play Im a blazers fan.... being realistic isnt part of my mindset If it was then Id be in full on depression I respect that. That cut deep No I do get getting AD is good I just really want to see kuz continue to get better on the lakers Dame and AD are the two best players from the 2012 class. I think it's destiny he comes to Portland Trade the whole team minus Dame and Nurk. Guaranteed WCF Ad to Miami For whiteside and Tyler Johnson?? Seems fair! Maybe Rodney mag rider too but theyd have to throw in Jru and some cash considerations Magruder Man I really think they should trade him before the deadline Sure Boston can get involved later but how many teams will put everything on the table right now to get an extra half season with AD? And even if a team gets the No. 1 pick, they suck and it would be dumb to trade Zion Any chance sixers get involved? I mean definitely but I dont think Simmons is on the table Can AD and Embiid play together? AD doesnt like being center But in terms of touches And Jimmy Def And Landry Shamet! You telling me Shamet is gonna give up his touches to AD?! Cant wait for Zion to be terrible Also Im in for the Miami/Blazers game So count me in for the ticket head count So Ive got Dylan, Brock, Gundy, Rengel and mark and Dubov as a maybe? Remind me the date The 5th? Yes If its 6 of us theres some seats in sec 333 row p for $17

Theres 18 seats available in section 322 row p for $14.50 The 5th of what? Burnetts Perfect Im def. in now Ok Im in Is the 2nd option cool with everyone? Its the best value on stubhub right now Doesnt make a difference to me Im fine with whatever anything outside of courtside is all the same Thats a pretty great deal If you havent bought the tickets yet Im in HOMEOWNER JIMMY SPENDING THAT MORTGAGE MONEY I havent I can buy 8 in the next hour. Anyone oppose or want to join as well? Jimmy where is your house Like exact address So I can TP it Swamp stomp at jimmys this year? Hell yeah. Christine has to move out for a week so we can build. Im down for that The blazer game Wow This is a party Fuck Im contemplating flying up for this game now Those tix are $20 after fees. Buy 9 right now? Cant wait to see AD in black and red Rengel
Gundy
Ian
Jimmy
Dylan
Brock
Mark
Clayton
Dubov Thats 9 So we already agree even if he doesnt resign. Trade CJ and two firsts and whatever expiring we have for AD? Yes Im in feb 5th right? CJ + Zach + 2 Firsts Against Spaces heat? Should get it done I feel like?! Yes I agree you do it fuck it. Thats everything you could want!! Albeit a stinky version of each category Chris Haynes aka Klutch HQ already saying Davis doesnt wanna be in Boston But picks, young promising guy, potential #1 dude More importantly it signals to Dame that the organization hears him and wants to make the most of his prime Are we still interested in Nico if that somehow falls through Yeah at some point dames loyalty needs to be rewarded And no longer taken for granted Buying now. Say no now or forever hold your crack piece Purchased. See you all in Miami 20 bucks with fees? Yeah PG13 really shouldve taught a,all market GMs a lesson You swing for the fences ?Only 666 miles away! I mean the pelicans did the same with boogie Btw the funniest thing about New Orleans is NO ONE gives a flying fuck about the pelicans Smoothie King Center is probably my favorite name on the planet though Pelicans are vicious IRL for the record Anyone see the stop sign in Portland that says WEARING CANADA GOOSE? Upgraded to first class on the flight back to SF. Its a sign they want me to keep this bender going. Ill oblige the Gods Dubov I made that drive probably 20 times during the year of 2015 Woof. https://twitter.com/trailblazers/status/1089992738076950528?s=12 We going to the ship! https://twitter.com/threekola/status/1090017921726857217?s=21 https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1090022247031623680?s=21 Whoops! Players cant request a trade? The nba is so dramatic Lol yeah right Nothing's gonna happen. $15k fine maybe New Orleans is so butt hurt What about Kawahi? Filing a law suit against the nfl and now this lol I guess Kawhi requested directly to the team. That was picked up by beat writers. AD made a public statement himself Yeah first Marcus Smart being fined $35k for going after Bembre - didnt even get a chance to hit him! Now this BS Lmao the nba is fucking stupid if theyre gonna allow lawsuits against their talent. Thats the product. Nobody gives a shit. It'll be a wrist slap If anything at all http://fw.to/kegEMEF Thats not a sketch link https://www.nbcsports.com/northwest/portland-trail-blazers/jake-dont-call-me-snake-layman-another-blazer-2nd-round-steal But JIC here is the story Thats exactly what somebody would say if they wanted you to click a sketch link... ???? Neil Olshey goes on the record to talk about how great he is at finding value in the 2nd round the day Anthony Davis requests a trade. Like, I just cannot When is iMessage going to come out with a fuck this reaction? Dude all these 2nd round "steals" that Olshey finds don't mean shit in the scheme of things when our top talent isn't good enough. Layman isn't gonna make an iota of difference against the warriors or in a trade Daryl Morey finds better guys than Layman in local Houston open gym runs I was talking about it with my buddy Richman, all those steals have turned into 17 million in dead money for Andrew Nicholson lol Whats the position called where its your job to find second round talent? I think its scout Yeah he let Barton go, traded the pick that turned into Malik Beasley who's actually legit, should have sold high on crabbe or let him walk, might have given up on Vonleh too soon and essentially got nothing in return for Batum. Completely fucked up the swanigan pick I'm failing to see any positives here To be fair I think a lot of people were out on Vonleh But yes, the rest of that is accurate He also waived Tim Frazier. Motherfucker. Two things on Vonleh: 1. I take him over Swanigan every day of the week 2. I think terry kinda fucked that one up. He didn't do a lot to help develop him AND HE TRADED ED DAVIS HOW THE FUCK DOES THIS GUY STILL HAVE A JOB Well, not trade. But you get the point. Didnt resign him. Oh my god Im fucking dying at this https://twitter.com/killakow/status/1090051339948822528?s=21 Hahaha holy shit that's good Lol Im dead Got emmmq https://twitter.com/jasonrmcintyre/status/1089913871014346753?s=12 God this is depressing. Anyone listen to the windy Lowe pod? No Beck: "what if the blazers jump in (the AD sweepstakes) and offer CJ and Nurk?"

Lowe: "yeah but they'd never even make a call to New Orleans so it's a non starter" *changes subject* ?? Wow Everyone knows he's sideline olshey Holy shit lol thats so embarrassing for our franchise Are we allowed to start calling Lonzo a bust when hes a backup point guard on the pelicans? He already is a bust in terms of his draft position Yeah but hes still the best signature athlete BBB has ever had I like how people thought that Lonzo was this Steph-lite long range bomber. Come to find his freshmen year shooting percentages were a complete fluke Lonzo still has potential His shooting is coming along, slowly. But his court vision is unreal He'll have a long career. But he's been pretty damn underwhelming thus far His Defense is legit Houman whats your assessment on ingram Houman please share your thoughts on Jack Nicholson. Im not a fan of Ingram His ceiling isnt much higher Hes got the body, athletic capability to be the next KD but he doesnt know how to shoot the jumpers consistently. He loves the elbow jumpers but he needs to expand his game. He tends to get into a tunnel vision when he has the ball Yeah, youre right. Jack has pretty much hit his ceiling. Not really sure what else there is for him to do. And as for kuzma yall already know that kid is a future all star Lonzo is more of a leader than Ingram too He was stepping up before the ankle injury, playing winning basketball and scoring more I still hate Odell but if he shows up and does what hes supposed to on Friday I will feel less hate The shining was good tho don't forget that Wow youre absolutely right Matty Had my first free personal training session through work today. Only me and my boss were there with the trainer ? Had to call it halfway though the workout and now I'm at home in a blanket until I have to leave for the office Didn't puke tho ! Our photographer looks like Jeff bridges with shorter hair and its tripping me out Next time he asks me about a shot Im gonna say Well, thats just, like, your opinion, man. Maybe slip a Biodigital jazz in there https://twitter.com/danegado/status/1089989981077032960?s=12 Kid can dream Lol I love how all the idiot jazz fans were like "no way jazz dish Ingles for Turner" Yeah that's totally the most ridiculous part of that deal Hahahhaah Holy shit you guys hear about that dude from empire that got attacked in Chicago? Yeah Messed up man So fucked up Fucking trump man. Bringing all the racists outta the shadows What happened? They straight up tried to lynch a guy, beat him poured bleach on him out a rope around his neck Wtf Was it racist or homophobic or both? https://www.tmz.com/2019/01/29/empire-star-jussie-smollett-attacked-hospitalized-homophobic-hate-crime/ And yelled "this is MAGA country" Who cares! The economy is boomin baby! Jobs! This is a good time to remember that Gunde voted for Gary Johnson By the way If I ever needed another reason to hate Howard fucking Schultz He bought the Heat? https://twitter.com/hpbasketball/status/1090324527832129536?s=21 This is the ?? I needed today I love that. Building up Dame while simultaneously tearing down Neil. Im all for the blazers slander but its important to note that were 30-21 and 4th in the West How's that different from last year mark? We're still playoff fodder. Good in the regular season, can't compete in the playoffs The world needs ditch diggers! At this pace we will make another 6 game playoff run Oh sick so if the playoffs started today we would get swept by James harden If you look at our record vs .500 or better teams the last few years it paints the whole picture. We have a losing record against good teams in the regular season, but we just win all the games we're supposed to We are gatekeepers Were the gatekeepers of the league Makes us look good in the regular season but then when we go up against another good team, with weeks to game plan against us. We get thrashed I learned that from mark We crush cans and lose to contenders Neil knows the best tho, no way AD makes a better team, right? Stotts is also atrocious at in game adjustments Yeah hes really great at knowing who is hot but not very good at schematic adjustments mid game A lot of 4th place western conference regular season finishes up in the moda rafters Be we all know more of the blame lands on Olshey. Stotts has squeezed so much out of this roster. If olshey even remotely improved us around the fringes each year we'd be much better But he try's to sell continuity like that's gonna win a playoff series. It's not 1972 I mean the Cavs made the finals with Ty Lue as coach soooooo WON the finals My 14y/o brother could have coached the Cavs that year They still would have won Lmaooo okay cause coaching a LeBron team is very easy It is Just stand back and grab some popcorn Ok but thats basically my point. The more talent you put together, the less you need a magician of a coach to make drastic adjustments Stfu Houman Arvin would sub out LeBron in crunch time The bulls could have Phil Jackson back and still fucking suck Because they have no talent Yeah idk what the argument here is lol. Like Dubov said, more talent means less impact on coaching Im working with David Finchers sister today and I gotta say... she sucks. https://twitter.com/psocotchnbcs/status/1090349538785734656?s=21 Thanks Neil Smh god damn Dame would be down 45 at half time and sound less defeated than that Yeah hes gotta tread lightly there though He knows any package would have to involve cj Fuck cj Wow Ian pulling us out of a blazers depression, 2019 is wild CJ a pillar of Reigning Champ We will not hear the slander Dave decker makes a great point. Even if AD left in 2020 then we'd have $30 mil in cap space to add someone to Dame/Nurk before dame hits free agency Then Niel could secure another 5 years as he signals another "re-tool after star leaves". It's a win win The coldest temperatures are expected to hit from Tuesday to Thursday, with forecasters predicting that Chicago will be colder than Antarctica.

The Illinois city could experience a low of -27F, with freezing winds making that feel closer to -50F, officials say. Dear God Holy shit Global warming is fake news Yesterday on PTI Uncle Tony said they should lock Cody Parkey outside to ice the kicker and I almost cried. The biggest issue with global warming is that it is called global warming which doest depict the extreme temperatures (up or down) or massive storms it causes nerd. That doesnt support my narrative so Ill choose to ignore it. Juss saying Oh God Trump's tweet is so bad Link https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1090074254010404864?s=21 Jesus fucking christ Jesus fuck I was fucking kidding but I shouldve known this asshole would go there Seems like satire Surreal stuff I stand by my previous statement Yesterday he retweeted himself and I thought that was the worst thing he could do on twitter. But there he goes doubling down. Twitter should have left his character count at 180 140* I really don't understand the global warming deniers Worst case, it's not as drastic as scientists say, but in the meantime you made an effort to help the planet https://twitter.com/thehoopcentral/status/1090344066460540928?s=21 This means we havent even called Kyler is such a joke Hahaha yikes ? Interesting wrinkle to the Knicks bid for AD. They can't trade KP this summer cuz he'll be a restrictive FA. So if the Pelicans don't like their offer before the deadline that eliminates another bidder yeah? What about cj and Harkless for holiday and mirotic Sure! Yeah if we could pounce on Holiday, Mirotic and/or Randle GIMME RANDLE Down for Randle I think holiday would bring some solid D too We could even throw in Meyers to seal the deal https://twitter.com/shamscharania/status/1090376655003156484?s=21 Fuck he might not be able to eat dinner tonight now BAHAHA That sure tells him!!!! Way to go Silver!!! Just listened to the entire 66 minute Dunc'd on mock trade deadline. Each guy represented a team and the Blazers weren't even mentioned in a mock trade Who is olsheys boss right now? Jody Allen Oh great So looks like we have olshey for another 5 years Yeah This reminds me of the cards with bidwell and kiem like the owner thinking theres all these problems with the team (that are essentially the GMs fault) and they wont cut bait just because of a homerun and base hit here and there from years ago https://twitter.com/bball_ref/status/1090385391318900736?s=21 ?? Dude he sucks Poor mans deaaron Fox Fox is good tho That must be a real poor dude Lol Fox last year wasnt that great but he wasnt as bad as Sexton either Dam Allan Houston was on that list He has like The worst environment To mature Ever https://www.instagram.com/p/BtPj-7on5XB/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=120wgk8wh6mk YEEEEEEUP! ? Trying to buy the brow now? You guys Rudy Gay hit a game winner tonight https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WK7lIjFsGvg Mark is stoked! Best rapper alive Noo not Rudy Gay lol Miss arguing about Rudy Gays superstar status blackout drunk at sun river Holy shit Im drunk. I was at a bar with a live band with a fiddle player and they let you smoke cigs indoors. I love the south. Smoking cigs and playing pool In a bar Is still the best I dont really smoke anymore Yeah it rules But Id be blasting a few if I was with you Dubov I also just rode an elevator with a Pimp and his hoe https://twitter.com/sreekyshooter/status/1090493618798784512?s=21 Lmao this dude played espn And thats what happens when you cut costs and lay-off journalists! Your product suffers! *steps off high horse* Alright guys. As I exit the Bay this week a few thoughts/statements 
1. I got here the first year golden state won. Hopefully I'm leaving as they've won their last
2. The memes are accurate; 99.9% of people here don't know who Bob Sura or Erick Dampier are 
3. I left countless strangers hanging on high fives at bars cuz they just assumed everyone there was a warriors fan
4. 30% of people here think the NBA started in 2014
5. I tried starting a "fuck Steph Curry" chant at a Future concert during the finals two years ago. It didn't catch on This warms my heart Happy trails Chad Wait does this mean the nuggets are gonna win the title since youre moving there? I would love that Dubov cuz that means Curry eats shit in the playoffs. Also if that were to happen, you bet your ass I'm moving to Portland next year That was my next question. If thats true you are selling your house and moving to Portland for sure! 100% Yeah at least in Denver You get a fun and likable second team Wow that is not allowed Denver is in the division Jk jk When do the heat visit Denver Ahhhh No thats fair All nba teams are likable You can pick up the nugz as a secondary team Ian. Then you will cover a 3rd of the league ?Wow fancy that. Two weeks. Everyone down for nuggets heat in Denver? There isnt one team that I dont like in the nba.... that includes the warriors Actually scratch that I hate the rockets....due to harden And melo isnt in the nba but whatever team he goes on I Hope sucks I just screenshotted this to bring back when the Lakers sign Melo That would really suck... I really do like the lakers rn It sounds like the Pelicans really want Lonzo I can see the BBB pop up shop on Bourbon now But lonzo dont want no pelicans True but he has no say in the matter lol https://twitter.com/brkicks/status/1090705625615646721?s=21 We reject him. No thanks Give me those fucking Tinkers you fake! ?? https://twitter.com/alexkennedynba/status/1090681105437650944?s=21 Hmm holding onto your draft picks as a small market team might have helped This start is insane CJ going for 70 or naw? Nah 69 Misses the FT CJ moving that trade value up This is perfect. CJ plays up his value to headline an AD trade tomorrow When we are at Anthony Daviss first game as a Blazer >>>>> Im reselling those tix..sorry guys I hope everyone understands were gonna blow this game Yes and then nothing happens Chad! So pumped! Lets get CJs value as high as we can then not make a move and lose first round of the playoffs Unfortunately, Dylan is 1000% correct ?? Fool me once shame on me... You guys talking about C.J. Anderson? Agreed his value is high #GoRams Rams could do it Or get blown out You could fuck off Put your rent money on Rams ML! Jared Goff is balling out for all the disenfranchised youth from Marin County Lololol Those poor fucking kids Tupac went to one semester of high school in Marin! Jesus. Rams by a million ?? ? *Clay Sunday night* Right? Im saying it now Hey guys remember when we could have traded CJ for AD and then had Donovan Mitchell slide in at the 2? Ok cool me too. Just your monthly reminder Meyers Red Bull dunk of the game again Lol. This is the worst return on ad spend maybe ever Dame, AD and Mitchell would be absurd Seth Curry > Donovan Mitchell - Neil Olshey All star reserves announced tomorrow. If Lamarcus makes it he's for sure gonna be the last pick again Dame is pissed with Seth curry lmao Why Stole a rebound when he was going for his first triple double Lol Fuel for the 3 point contest Meyers played... good tonight? Did I actually just say that 2019 is too weird Chad is high on that mile high kush Blazers are off until Sunday, its trade time. ?Chad always on the clock https://www.instagram.com/p/BtRni0flDda/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=6rq82zahpt9g Who wants to go back to school? Hard pass Kinda nsfw but a must watch! https://twitter.com/p4u1_13/status/1089994767709208581?s=12 Jesus Christ http://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1091008072888262657 Lol demps wont answer Pelinkas calls This is incredible And Gayle Benson wants the Lakers to take a hike https://twitter.com/jacobjbg/status/1091017754105147392?s=21 Wow that is fucking epic Help a small market brother out then Gayle Nothing says small market star like CJ McCollum baby? !!! God I can see it now Dame, AD, Aminu, the new big 3 CJ and Zach look like they appreciate a good beignet Lehigh and Gonzaga are models the NO franchise should look to anyway Things are looking up boys ?Someone say beignet Oh man those old Vietnamese waitresses must have hated you https://twitter.com/samesfandiari/status/1091024860392742912?s=21 ?Everyone get your picks in AD and Dame. Whens the last time blazers had 2 all-stars? 2015 ???????????? That only works if you count LaMarcus and dame getting in as an injury replacement I love that Dame is a lock this year Westbrook is the only one Im having trouble with but I think he gets it even tho his shooting his historically bad DeAaron Fox probably more deserving Yeah he'll make it as a wild card The last spot IMO comes down to either Lamarcus, Tobias, Luca or Mitchell/Gobert Could DeRozan be a wild card??? Good point. Forgot about him Luka Would be the most fun I agree He's fucking killing it Westbrook is a cancer that in 3 years will do what melo did to the rockets... fully mestazsize into a malignant cancer I like this segment: The Diagnosis w/ Basketball Dr Mitorabi Porzingis!!! https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1091045059699576832?s=21 Do it Neil! ?Not again gundy Kristops calm down bro.... you havent played ball all year Your future is your injured still Who we trading for KP Meyers. Who says no? When we have Dame, Porzingis and AD >>>> https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1091067322700316672?s=21 One day a WOJ tweet will include the blazers. After Olshey croaks. God we suck Wow https://twitter.com/shamscharania/status/1091072994384973826?s=21 The Mavericks are sick https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1091073106658160644?s=21 Lol wut Woj need a nap Is he high? DSJ for Kristaps seems stupid for the Knicks but hey its a jimmy dolan org Kristaps and Doncic gonna be lethal That trio in Dallas is gunna be deadly What?!!! Holy shit WHERE IS SIDELINE OLSHEY!!! This is Fucking horseshit I wonder if smith is included in this trade He absolutely is Dude NY could have had DSJ in the draft instead of Nkilita lmao But now they can have both! It's probably DSJ, Barnes and We$ Deandre instead of Barnes Oh good call Max slots https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1091076373765124108?s=21 Omg The Knicks How!?!?!? Lmao Knickstape Man CJ would have been solid in the big Apple Man dame is going to lead the fire olshey chant here pretty soon If wes is bought out, maybe a reunion in Portland?? He would be sweet off the bench. I feel like its going to come out they didnt even call other teams Yeah man this is unreal. The inaction during the most hyper aggressive trade szn for stars ever is not gonna fly with dame Kawhi
PG
Porzingis
Jimmy Butler
Blake Griffin
CP3
Kyrie
Derozan
Demarcus Cousins All traded in the last 2 years and we weren't even mentioned in whispers Also shows how off olshey was when he resigned all those guys cuz he thought rest of league saw them as strong assets I mean hey guys it could be worse. We could have traded CJ, Aminu and Nurk for some good players but this way we can just wait for them all to walk for free in free agency! Gundy what does the shams tweet mean This is a great trade for Knicks They just cleared up 30 mil in cap for next year This is 2010 all over again ?????? They say they want KD and Kyrie but theyre gonna get Jimmy Butler Except they just used Porzingis to salary dump players and get a young player who they could have had for free 2 summers ago Lol That's not great use of a top 25 player me thinks Matty what you mean That was the first initial trade tweet Package is finalized now I agree https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1091076373765124108?s=21 Also everyone knows why they didn't pick DSJ right? Phil Jackson wanted Frank to run the triangle But if hes not happy and basically wants out then this is a good trade for your future Nice last parting gift from Phil Houman no matter how you spin it this wasn't a good trade lol Also heres something the Knicks possible know is maybe kristops isnt progressing health wise as well as he should All Im saying is if they get KD /Kyrie in the summer then this was a great trade ??????? Ok sure but good luck explaining this to the fans when they don't sign either of those guys Its amputation to save the patient A full cure is in trials summer 2019 One thing that I think is underrated is how many real life trades would get you laughed out of the room at on Twitter ?True life: a blazers fan Gundy was referring to shams tweet about how zinger intends to signed some option with Mavs or something Oooooooh Hes apparently strongly considering signing the 1 year qualifying offer Instead of take a deal as a restricted free agent But I think if Dallas offers the max he takes it Got it thank u Lol this is a weird wrinkle in the Deandre Mark Cuban saga ? Deandre was a shell of himself this year too NBA is good, nfl is bad Everyone loves trades Super Bowl week content is terrible anyway. The game is the only good thing https://twitter.com/finnereaux/status/1091089404939124736?s=21 Called the west reserves exactly D Lo probably gets in as injury replacement for Oladipo Im bummed LA wasnt first one out Gunde feed the clickbait gods now that LeBron is back https://lebronwire.usatoday.com/2019/01/31/lebron-james-lakers-clippers-thursday/ Lakers +1 Its time Are Kyrie and KD going to the knicks now? Or is BS fucking high BS is high Thats what I thought Needed credible NBA reality check Its a theoretical possibility But theres no way stars want to go there I mean its a cap play right? Yeah and apparently Porzingis was telling guys NOT to come to the Lakers according to Stephen A Stephen A is really credible On the nba he is Eh Gunz Players talk to him Idk dude Thats overstating Stephen A actually has a background in reporting unlike BS Yes but BS knows better sources than Stephen A Thats not disputed Idk about that dude Lowe doesnt go to Stephen A he goes to Bill with shit For instance Gunz Stephen A has a guy feeding him shit I know that for certain Bill gargles balls of players for info all the time A guy who runs his twitter and social media He's biased as hell Thats fine dude but I think his info is legit Guys Im sorry if youre backing Stephen A Im out Stephen A been grinding in the NBA dude, its been his best for 20 years Hes awful *his beat Wow im a Stephen A Stan I just hate according to Stephen A Yeah gunz thats fine I just think youre better than that Stephen A is a caricature at this poot Point Dude he plays both roles I agree Bill is not in that lane anymore Hes an amazing orator who also talks to people Gunz if you still think that Im sad Im sorry he forgot about Hunter Henry Gunz hes just not the guy you use anymore as a credible source This is one of the earliest things I learned in the game: Stephen A knows things Use a knicks beat guy or something He used to, I dont doubt It Ive heard how great he was, tons of stories Stephen A was a G He still is dude! At this point hes cashing checks and yelling on tv #TeamStephenA Good for him, but he isnt the guy Im looking at for information the same way I dont look to Sean Hannity for news ? These are not even comparable things lmao Im mind blown... Clayton doesnt listen to fox? Im a Gunz Stan and youre fucking killing me right now Lol I dont listen to everything Stephen A says Houman Im almost finished with Michelles book and I have floor seats to see her in PDX But hes from New York and has a newspaper background I believe him on this Porzingis shit Gunz he made his hay in Philly right? Not NY Just like I believe him when he said LeBron tried to get KD to the Lakers last summer Houman at this point Ill bomb the towers with you Hes been at ESPn for 15 years thats basically New York Gunz He isnt a NY guy He was a Philly guy And he loves to say crazy shit Lets stop with this Stephen A isnt credible Even if it ends up being right, its the same way Alex Jones is right sometimes Hes from New York bro Say enough crazy shit, something is gonna be correct He says shit crazily but the shit he says is not crazy Guys. My ducks are up on the #2 team in the pac on the road Further supplanting the idea the ducks are the best team in the pac who cant close a game out The ducks are going to win the auto bid into the tourney. You heard it here first. Because Dana is the best coach in the pac and a top 5 coach nationally and its not a joke. When is draymonds deal up The 4 of the future I just want him to go to another team and suck Next summer Dubov hes not going to be good when he leaves Itll be really fun to see Its gonna be great When everyone goes oh wait he was never that good? Wow Im drunk and ready to Stan for Draymond, the aggressive Boris diss Diaw* Anybody else join me for Lakers +1? Lebron playing or nah? Im seeing mixed reviews on the social meeds Youre stanning for Dray and Stephen A LeBron did play and they coveted Covered Horray! https://twitter.com/shamscharania/status/1091372179076325379?s=21 In the words of a guy I hate Clay Travis, Dont be a pussy Neil! https://twitter.com/e_woodyard/status/1091402333332791296?s=21 ? Could we not have traded for Kristaps? Not enough expirings? We werent willing to trade meyers Dylan , let me tell you about a little thing called roster consistency We have a ton of trash players to help the, tank Yeah we dont have any expirings except Aminu And we desperately need him so Fuck I hate the blazers And hes also not even making that much We wasted a couldve been HOFer career Dame could be the best blazer ever Yep Doesnt mean shit tho Poor guy I dont know how this never gets him down This isnt fucking rocket science. I get Russell is different than dame. But this small market excuse stuff is bullshit. Jazz and OKC are sitting just fine IMO. Like, he still balls out every night Idk how he doesnt put his balls on the table and say fire the GM, change what were doing or Im gone hes too nice and loyal of a guy Yeah Dame needs to start whipping his 4x all-star dick around Melo to the blazers lets gooo We have already lost 1 blazer to cancer this year I dont want to have to lose the whole team. Malignant cancer I dont want the blazers to have to undergo chemo Damn well Melo is dead anyway because cam just murdered him in cold blood https://twitter.com/dkurtenbach/status/1091397116306419713?s=21 Dehaan and Sami should just pick opposites. You all know what happened 4 years ago today? https://twitter.com/bleacherreport/status/1091429144666214403?s=21 Great day Anyone down to come to the mouth for Super Bowl? Wife and kid are gone for a week. or alternatively whats PDX bros plan this weekend? I actually dont have work on Monday now So Im down to get weird for the super bowl Im drinking And gambling And smoking were weed ? Also Ive decided Im all in on the Rams for the SuperBowl Saw a crazy stat, Goff is the quickest #1 overall qb to get to a super bowl Sami and Dehaan have been officially warned about collusion I mean how will you stop that. Im boycotting my final pick all together Haha no collusion here! Lol Tuesday Is going to be so lit How deep are we rolling? 9 Inches Brown You guys I hope my sources are wrong But Ive heard there is zero CJ trade chatter Fuck Neil man Muahahaha fuck the Celtics ? Anyone can print that is the dick on the desk I would like to see from Dame Former blazer Malik Beasley with a cool 35 on the rockets tonight smh He has been a very solid fantasy pickup https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1091568224880201728?s=21 Im a better GM than Neil I heard it was Rondo *or* Lance lmao Lol that final piece really puts it over the top The fact that Gabe and I have hotels two blocks apart is big trouble for everybody here Oh lets goooo! https://twitter.com/trailblazers/status/1091545861564227584?s=12 Why isnt Meyers in the G league? Would make the other players worse , bad for talent dev Gundy that Dwight Jaynes triggered me so hard I felt like I was reading Neils emails to him Like Jesus Christ ??????? Also whos got some powder in their bovada account? I got a hot one. Not even offering CJ for Anthony Davis is malpractice Neil is such a fucking pussy How long does the organization let this happen? Til new ownership Ok so Gabe has timed the national anthem rehearsal 5 times And its been 1:59 on the dot every time We are going to lose Dame Because of this bullshit Someone catch me up We wouldn't include CJ in AD talks??? Damn and bovado is over/under is 1:49 Thats a good looking prop, nice Dubov I made this. I am over his bullshit and he needs to be stopped. http://chng.it/byc6ptcX https://twitter.com/nbcsnorthwest/status/1091753674882334724?s=21 Chad its all here Does Gabe know the outfit that Gladys Knight will be wearing too? Lol Straight Neil propaganda Wowowowow Dubov this is the inside information we need! I dont think so DeHaan. But he should be able to determine the Gatorade color today Over @ -190 It is fate for Gabe to be the one to be able to have the access to this info This is fantastic Gabe is worth his weight in gold right now Woah woah can he actually figure out the Gatorade color? He said he could. He did last year I guess. https://nba.nbcsports.com/2019/02/02/report-portland-buyer-at-trade-deadline-first-round-pick-in-play/ Does Gabe know what the final score of the game? That will help me make sure Ill beat Rengel Yes maybe Otto porter Is our best hope I want in on this Gatorade coloring I think he said 69-69 tie Who do you think we would have to give up for Otto? Contract and a pick is what Zach Lowe said a few months ago That seems like a no brainer. If CJ isnt on the table for ad hes not on the table for porter CJ needs to be on the table. He needs to drive to IKEA, buy the table, build the table, and pull the chair out for any GM that wants to make a trade. Whats ottos contract? So no word on what Old gladdy is wearing tomorrow eh? Im in dubie thanks for the word Hahaha Dubov I'm dying Buy the table Neil!

Olshey has a plan Because he wont even call the pelicans about Anthony Davis Im not asking him to put CJ on the table for Kevin love or Aaron Gordon. A top 7 player is available and he wont even make the fucking call ? I can't remember, did he ever make an offer for Kawhi? Nope! https://www.change.org/p/the-portland-trailblazers-fire-neil-olshey Sign the petition you guys Holy Jesus why is espn not covering the Super Bowl right how Now* Cause ESPN is dead Its god damn GYMNASTICS ON ESPN Its 2019 bro Why are you watching that trash anyway Head to NFL Network ??

Ive never seen a coin base ad on Farmersonly.com so I didnt know that existed Dylan uses cornbase Cornhub.com ^^^ early jerk pff session ? ? Rodney Hood ?? Neil needs a contract extension ASAP Wait wait We traded stauskas? And wade Baldwin And 2nd founders... for Rodney Hood?!?!? ?? Lol yes mark CJ, Hood, and 2 future firsts for AD? These are the big time deals that Neil gets done period! I said earlier that Neil had a plan He had to respond to gundys shots this morning Neil made a move! Holy shit he's alive Its a good move Holy shit what a day That seems like a little much for hood though right? Nah Pay to play mark Are we trying to open up a roster spot for Gary Trent Jr or something? Thats a great trade... Nik isnt as good as hood and when will wade ever play Rodney hood on the jazz or Rodney hood in the playoffs last year? Which we getting? 12/2/2 with defense And tbh when have 2nd picks ever turned out good Cool trade Neil Jesus fucking Christ Neil over here putting lipstick on a pig It's all a sideshow Goddamnit I wake up from a nap and Rodney fucking Hood is a blazers? Im going back to sleep. Cavs have 7 2nd round draft picks Do we have any 2nds left in the next decade? Actually 9 now including theres IIRC we traded 2 for robin Lopez, 2 for Thomas Robinson, 2 for Jake Layman and 2 for Gary Trent What happened to being a master of finding second round talent Goodnight sweet prince Ill trade every 2nd round pick thru 2050 Theres only 1 manu ginobli every 30 years Draymond! Yea whos the best 2nd rounder of all time Gotta be Monta Ellis This is fucking upsetting For every Jokic and Milsap theres about 40 Rick brunsons Come on gunz its just classicnat this point Jokic mark Dudes bout to finish top 3 in mvp All these teams buying Ferraris and we get used civics Monta Ellis last pick overall out of high school. The pride of Jackson, Mississippi! Isaiah Thomas last pick of draft Rodney Hood is better than all those guys so.... Im with dylan...2nd rd picks arent worth keeping Id rather have a guy that I know can play than a dude who has a 5% chance of still being in the nba in 2 years Reminds me of back when we traded for aflalo Cavs can have 9 2nd rd picks but wtf are they gunna do with that... no one is trading them a lottery pick You know when you get .15 cents back from the cashier and you throw it on the ground... thats what 2nd rd picks are Yeah fuck Neil but at least hes picking up the damn phone Is he somehow deals Meyers he will be redeemed Also Houman were not all doctors I definitely keep the .15c Im a med student with more debt than most likely any of you lol Maybe jimmy has more debt than me now Ya so keep the change..you filthy animal Houman cant wait for you to have all that student debt only for AOC to pass universal healthcare in 2022 and have your earning potential sliced by 80% Welcome to the new world order you capitalist pigs!!! ?? ?? ?? Never going to happen Medicine is the new big business... just wait till I get my hands on pharma money ^trust him hes a doctor And to be honest universal healthcare isnt a good idea.... it takes away from actual
Medicine You cant actually diagnosis a patient because your not allowed to order certain tests/ labs because your on a universal system. So if people like us walk into a hospital with a problem chances are were going to leave without a proper work up Houman Hannity. My boi The bigger problem with health care is how homeless people basically use hospitals as a shelter..... thats what sucking this healthcare system dry. Preventive medicine is what is going to fix this system not giving everyone health care cause its going to hurt people more than help Houman you are worse than that Virginia doctor in the news right now Why cant we euthanize all the homeless people? How about universal firing squads There are patients in the hospitals for years cause nobody wants them Everyday they cost 2-3k by using that hospital bed... having universal healthcare isnt going to change that. We still cant discharge them Ive never felt so educated on super bowl Sunday Insider scoop brought to you by bud light.... keep on riding Dubov how many $2 hot dogs are you going to eat?

Picks: ??
All-nba potential: ??
Cap relief: ?? Olshey's forte is selling the allure of "young players" and "promise and potential". He does it to our fan base every summer. This should be easy Too bad hes a bitch And well pick up jamychal green or some shit Shit. If we're even lucky ?"You're telling me Caleb Swanigan doesn't get your engine going?" Maybe this will make you want to reconsider..next time you trash The ?? https://twitter.com/jamiehudsonnbcs/status/1092566504669728768?s=12 Fucking lmao What is her point? BAHAHAHA YESSSSS Knowing meyers has a home gym makes me question his abilities even more Hahahahah That's the pussiest shit I've ever seen. Why are people this dumb "people don't criticize doctors" Ya cuz nobody played pickup doctor growing up There was no 8th grade doctor traveling team Idk Operation was a pretty dope game Nobody is saying they think they can be in the nba. We're saying Meyers gets paid millions of dollars to be the best of the best, so he deserves all the criticism in the world if he can't play up to par. He signed up for this shit. Be better or take a hike it's that simple Go cry on a stack of money Also its so easy to not read the criticism Just turn off the computer Pelicans are crazy if they dont do that trade They literally get an entire young core who will actually excite the fans Jayson Tatum baby And also LOL at actually believing Danny ainge Holy shit bagley ?? Wow I just saw that Dope ass dunk but everyone giving him a 360 needs to chill lol ?Lakers about to give up 4 1st rounders??? 4 first and second Assuming its 2 and 2 If youre going to the game tonight, send me your email.

I feel like he's talking league wide. Something from Haynes maybe. Olshey doesn't even talk to him lol Yeah Haynes and Dame are like IRL friends We gonna get some insider scoops at the game tonight, Gunz? Bill's trade value article was updated today. CJ has a worse trade value than John Collins Wow John wall ruptured Achilles Yeah wtf. How did he do that sitting on the bench Gotta be the worst contract in the league He slipped at his house apparently Wow why does that happen to ball players more often than regular people No Fucking way he slipped hahaha Thats what the team said Perfect symbolism of the wizards franchise So his career is pretty much done Right as his Super Max kicks in ?? American dream tbh ?Keep gettin dem checks President, John Wall ? To be fair he got an infection from his previous surgery which caused the Achilles to become weak DR HOUMAN WITH THE WELL, ACTUALLY Just reporting what Im reading So its the surgeons fault He cant get surgery yet Cause of the infection The Diagnosis! Houman could you save him?? Fly Dr Mirtorabi in asap!! As long as he donates his next year salary to the superliga NFL players gotta be so pissed right now. That happens to a QB and they just cut his ass and don't pay him Happy Chinese new year Wow that was lit Yeah Matty I just did that to a bunch of people good lookin out ?????? If the Lakers keep Lonzo that means KD and Kyrie are going to the Knicks stay woke ?? Lakers pull out huh? Negotiating tactic Still got 48 hours to go but theyre not upping their offer anymore What was the final thing they offered? Lonzo, Ingram, Kuzma, Hart, Zubac, KCP and two firsts They didnt want to give up two other firsts Lol what is there left to negotiate? From what I understand its just ball in pelicans court Lakers are done giving them more Pelicans havent even officially responded to the offer The door is complete wide open and Neil doesnt even want to take a peek inside. Jackass. Hot damn, alright time for Neil to offer 2020-2030 first rounders Funny thing is the NO GM wants all these future picks and he isnt even going to be around to use them CJ, Collins, Aminu, and Simons plus a couple picks is a better deal. Theres an A$AP Rocky concert at the memorial coliseum tonight Two for Tuesday? Man I fucking flew from nyc to Seattle And am now getting on the Amtrak To watch the heat get trashed Fired up!

What a pleasant surprise GUNDY THE LAKERS TRADED THE UKRAINE MAKER ARE YOU KIDDING ME Reggie Bullock SZN!!!! Never forget that Gunde kneeled during the national anthem for Black History Month https://www.instagram.com/p/Bthvd2Ag_3C/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=wcaedyhsontr You guys are lucky you don't have to listen to this trash TNT broadcast. I wish we could listen to wheels instead Dude for real what the fuck happened to tnt? They tried some "players only" stunt tonight. Aka the b squad from nbaTV and it failed miserable Speaking of failing miserably I put $100 on blazers -7.5 They do players only every week God dammit they are so bad. And they cant lean on their players only, baby! Tagline every 3 minutes to save them. On TNT? I see KG's thing or the studio crew but not the broadcast team But maybe I missed it. This shit is awful Fuck off ET Meyers. Wtf CJ playing up that trade value again Wheres dame at this 4th Q? CJs D is garbage though I think I can hear spaceman yelling ? Layman ??????? Fuck you spaceman!!! D Wade / Meyers jersey swap tho?? Wait actually? No way Lmao nah it was Lillard Figured Even though he played like shit Boban ?? BoBomb Oh hell yeah Jesus the clippers just gave up Tobias for two firsts? What the hell are they doing Getting ready for Kawhi And they got two prized picks if they wanna make an Anthony Davis trade That Miami 2021 pick is juicy Not bad for either team Isn't it only one? The other pick is the sixers which will be late twenties The 2021 Miami pick is unprotected I know. I'm just saying only one prized pick Its the pick that went to Phoenix Ok The 76ers pick ain't blowing anyone away Also how dumb is Phoenix for trading that to move up 6 spots in the draft lmao Clippers dont wanna be stuck in 8th seed purgatory Thats why they made the deal Makes sense. Hey props to anyone willing to take a big swing. I'd take that over conservative olshey We got Rodney hi Tho* I have a strange feeling one of either jimmy or Tobias won't resign this summer tho Neil is making baby steps No way they keep all 4... not even the warriors are that high to pay that much in tax Neil ain't doing shit. This just gets fans off his back for a couple months We're in a weird spot too cuz if Hood plays too well for us, he plays himself into a higher contract and off the team. So we have to root for him to play well but not TOO well We can only offer him like 5.5 mil a year Honestly nobody is gonna give him that at this point Hoods biggest problem is he sucks in the playoffs What if he drops 25/5 in a playoff game? Some dumb GM will throw the MLE at him He doesnt handle pressure very well Don't underestimate dumb GM's lol TRUE All it takes is one ^mr. Olshey Myers Leonard, ET?? https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1093184617178415105?s=21 Thats pretty interesting Stanley Johnson never became what I thought he would You guys I think Neil is gonna get Blake Griffin The pistons are tearing it all down A bunch of the bad 2016 contracts and a first gives the pistons salary relief 3 years earlier Theres real reason for Detroit to do it ? Blake to the blazers??? Who we giving up? A first, Harkless, Meyers and Aminu Or a first, Harkless, Meyers, Evan for Blake Griffin and Langston Galloway Blake has 3 years left and the blazers shit deals only 1 Maybe give them Simons But you give them cap flexibility sooner and an asset Wait, are you serious? Because thatd be amazing Keep Aminu and get rid of ET Neil trying to get on chads good side! You mean keep the Aminu that couldnt even hit two threes last night? Fuck that. Get rid of them both ET I could build a house for the homeless with all the bricks I throw up and Aminu Ive seen better streaks in my underwear Lol I think Aminu can do more than ET, and gets rid of his ugly contract. Wait Gundy is this substantiated? Its just based on me seeing the pistons look like theyre tearing it down If they plan on sucking next year and want flexibility 2 years earlier...Portland can do that for them Ohhhh you got our hopes up, you know Neil isnt making that call I thought this was a cyber dust source. Don't play me like that Gundy Olshey is sitting on his hands til summer April 3rd SuperLiga takes over the Moda Center again? Jesus Christ blue balls on Blake Yeah seriously Sorry for having hope guys Haha negative thoughts only cmon Tyler Johnson is a Phoenix Sun! https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1093247620473077760?s=21 Well Can we get Wayne Ellington with our extra roster spot? He seems like a 76er to me What about Wayne Brady? They actually can guarantee him a spot Man good riddance tj I rode for that guy too This has been a relatively uneventful deadline. WHERE IS THE CRAZY SHIT I KNOW ITS COMING Fuck man Im gonna miss The man with the golden arm Should be called The man with the worst nickname is basketball I hope this is part of some cap dump to land someone big Why the fuck do we need Ryan Anderson Lets riot in the streets Otto Porter got salary dumped for Jabari and Bobby Portis BUT WE GOT RODNEY HOOD THO Omg They salary dumped him WHAT THE FUCK And a 2023 2nd round pick We couldnt have gotten in on that, though, right? Not if theyre trying to dump salary? Not if they wanted it this summer Probably coulda gotten in to give them a pick If you give them a first to hold the money for one more year https://twitter.com/mdotbrown/status/1093314645631295488?s=12 normally disagree with almost everything Myles has ever tweeted but I couldnt agree more with this https://twitter.com/hohighlights/status/1093318985578364928?s=12 BENCH HIS SELFISH ASS (Then trade him to Portland) https://twitter.com/br_nba/status/1093256390167199750?s=21 Lol he's tired of missing all star games Sooooo is olshey gonna make another move? Or do we need to brush off the pitchforks tomorrow I started spit shining my pitchfork this afternoon In other less frustrating news, who did the ducks sign today? https://twitter.com/blazer_gang/status/1093269560369676288?s=12 Site your sources BG KOC reported that Ah Figured they got it from somewhere No way Neil gives up a first for him 2 more 2s He's worth a first tho ain't he? We don't need another simons Dont think so on expiring deal tho right? Unless we can include Meyers! Hes expiring come on Pelicans are posturing Of course they want a first Its either lose him or get a 2nd Theyre going full tank mode and everyone knows Okay but you forget about bird rights There's value in being able to resign that player It's not like you're only paying for 3 months worth of him https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1093347451266834432?s=21 No picks Wow Dirk, z-bo, kristops Interesting Wtf We could have had him too! Salary dump after salary dump Of decent players And we cant get shit This is disgusting Im gonna throw up Fucking joke If terry ends up getting fired and Neil doesnt... I would take either porter or Barnes in a heartbeat at the 3 Going to riot Lets stage a fucking coup Im Venezuelan Im used to these Hostile takeover with the military I thought your Mexican? https://twitter.com/pdxtimmay/status/1093350693451091968?s=21 We must march on Tualatin If this isn't sobering (Regarding the kings) https://twitter.com/bosnianbeast27/status/1093351603736784896?s=21 What does it mean! Hes also wondering why the fuck we arent doing anything Exactly The players are getting pissed God even Nurk knows Neil is a fraud wow https://twitter.com/shamscharania/status/1093361595709825024?s=21 For Mirotic?? https://twitter.com/davidaldridgedc/status/1093362969029865473?s=21 Wow Washington is having a fire sale Brad Beal next? Ill take beal 0% chance they move Beal. Hes the one they want to build around. They have the sorriest roster in the league though Meyers would be a good building block for them https://twitter.com/davidaldridgedc/status/1093365599554674688?s=21 Okay Neil I'll settle for Trevor ariza Nope. Trevor is still banned from Portland. Man I will never forget In 2019 When the heat came to town And imposed their will against the blazers Left the city in shock Wades swan song ? ? ? Did the chat talk about KDs press conference? Triple B Just saw the kD stuff Ridiculous ?I think I just became a Canes fan o Hes like that one LB from the water boy What happened with KD Oh he gone He had a meltdown Because hes tired of the media lol Not like its part of his job or anything He dodged the media for 10 days God he's so fucking sensitive Right I saw lebrons pussy ass post about Barnes too And the athletic wrote something that everyone in the warriors is resigned to the fact he will probably leave And he got upset Cause its the truth I'm team media on this one And I'm also souring on lebron. He's kind of a bitch Also I love Bron but the player empowerment shit is pretty hollow coming from him right now He cares about LeBron empowerment His entire team is collateral damage lmao Exactly. He doesn't give a fuck about other players KD makes it so hard for me to like him. I want to like him so bad because the dude is an incredibly player who loves the game. But goddamn why you gotta be so sensitive? You guys think Neil used a PTO or sick day today? neil is making me sick today so I might have to burn one Gundy, know false hope today with more Blake news like yesterday Can we at least get Aaron Gordon or something Or ariza No more hope I can do that https://twitter.com/fireneilolshey/status/1093264011829760000?s=21 Chad is that your burner?

Unbelievable One move and Neil fades back into the mist? It's okay we're getting AD Pfft Four second round picks 4 It's not like Neil didn't have a front row seat to Mirotic slaughtering us last year. Cuz he literally did Neil has spent all day patting himself on the back for the big move he made this year I literally can't think of anyone I hate as much as Neil olshey Gunz semi related question with Paul Allen's passing who would be leaning on neil right now I'd rather have John Nash and Steve Patterson back McGowan probably Who's that President of basketball ops or something Team President who now has a big role at Vulcan Gotcha And he loves Neil cuz he's about increasing the bottom line. Both of them are about ticket sales But technically its Jody Allen or Bert Kolde, Pauls college roommate and bff Omg sauce and Baldwin hit the road again lmao To where? https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1093572477077336064?s=21 Wade baldwin had a storied blazers career 4th team this week!

Haha god fuck that guy Is Skal white? Do we have the whitest team in the league now? Hes half white.so yes Hes Haitian The photo was black and white so I guessed So Neil officially admitted the Swanigan pick was an absolute bust Had Josh Hart and Jordan Bell on the board Yup! But Skal was once No. 2 in his draft class Even tho hes not a rotation player on the Kongs Kings And hes young so the average age goes down Olshey =light years We getting Rodney hood tonight?! I think so Rondo damnnn Holy shit haha That was epic I like how LA bitched about playing center all the time here. Now he's a full time center lmao did Kevin Harlan just say resting your load? #SelfCare Lmao yeah he sure did Yo Layman is kinda dope ? Whoa Pop seems like hes in a good mood tonight. Must be that Oregon vino. Is ZC not in the rotation So our number 10 pick last year is now the 11th man. Is that good? ?

Hoods 14 points on 6-7 shooting Do you think maybe you owe a certain front office executive an apology? We in the hood Idk guys maybe Neil was right With Moe, Curry and Collins as our 9,10 and 11th option at least we have some depth Kenny Smith was talking about Hoods playoff experience during half, that is pretty valuable as well You mean when Rodney played like shit in the playoffs? I didnt actually look at his stats lol God his playoff stats are terrible He got jumped in the Cavs rotation by Jordan clarkson Guys we had 3 first round draft picks in one of the deepest drafts in years and I'll Neil has to show for it is a 10th man who's out of the rotation If he would have mildly succeeded we could be a 3 seed lock right now We literally traded up to 10 to pick a backup center when we needed starters at 3 and 4 ?This is Peltons value per pick. Do you think we overpaid trading 15 and 20 for 10? ? ?? Really need a better showing out of Matt and Chad in the Superliga the next few days. Brock and Dehaan need to go down.

But what Im not kidding about is thats actually a terrible Closeout by Zion. Never leave your feet, big fella.

We need to go 6-4 to be in contention in the west... or else were gunna fall to 7/8 Is there a congressional Democrat that *isnt* running for President? Gunde voting for Howard schultz this time since no Gary Johnson fuck starbucks lol like Amy Klobuchar just entered the race Without googling it can any of you tell me who she represents currently Kuz on pace for 92!!! all the Somalian terrorists in Minnesota threatening the fabric of our great american society would be my guess You would be correct DAME IS COOKING Whats for lunch Horse Terrys rotations might cost us this game Nurk done Fuck What the fuck just happened We scored 9 points in the 4th Dame sat most of the 4th What a fucking joke And terry didnt manage Nurks minutes correctly Terrible calls by the ref Nah Both times the defender puts his arms up and comes down Those were both good no calls You can come down Cant* I think the first one shouldve been called Look at the replay of both he came down at the last second We lost that game on our own The first one was the most obvious lol Houman please The last second one wasnt as obvious 9 points in the 4th is laughable 21-0 run Neither of those were fouls and even if they were they have nothing to do with 10 scoreless minutes Fucking joke that we have to lean on dame so hard. He goes scoreless, the team goes scoreless Dame had a huge third quarter Also Stotts gotta go with Hood over Harkless All Harkless can do offensively is clog up the paint lol But this goes back to Terry not being able to adjust in game. Sure the start of the 4th is when you normally rest Dame but you cant leave your all-NBA guard on the bench in a close game when nobody else can get buckets. Even if thats your normal rotation Completely agree. Terry is a good assistant that's it And youre right Gundy. Moe put up 5 & 4 why is he in during crunch time https://www.blazersedge.com/2019/2/10/18218977/gameday-thread-blazers-at-mavericks#comments Lmao 1100 comments https://twitter.com/chold/status/1094728743422173184?s=21 Dope Love to hear that Oh awesome thats gonna do wonders for his matchup vs Russ tomorrow ? Exactly We played bad but this was the call that should have been made Yeah we just blew that game I think maybe Rip City Keith might not be looking it at through the most objective lens lol Twas the weekend of 20+ point comebacks ?????? I love when players use twitter like that I dont see any tweets from rip city Keith about the couple of phantom fouls they called on Powell and Kerber lol Earlier in the game Damn sixers dripping 143 ?????? Any of yall watch high flying bird on flix? No but I heard about it. Any good? Watching it now. Ill report back. Wow so refreshing to watch the warriors get suffocated by a gritty eastern conference defense Heat are the future of basketball Flying bird is not really that great in my mind. Very slow for it being only 1 1.5 hour situation Watching iverson now though Seriously though heat warriors is ?? leave pass rn 1 point game in the fourth D Wade!!!!! Epic! Oh baby! J Rich!!!! Fuck kd Dam Damn Ah bummer dude ! Man I thought waiters had it ? ? Philly is unreal tho I bet 10 on them to win the title last night low key 14-1 Wait Alicia Keys is married to Swizz Beats?!

Rich get richer And then Wayne Ellington goes to Detroit Morris, Gortat and Kanter are still available yeah? Also sending Lin to potentially the heaviest Asian market is just classic And Boucher got a permanent contract Lets go raptors And Marc Gasol comes off the bench Look at what happens when you go all in for a superstar God I would have given CJ and my left nut for PG right now We would be the team signing Jeremy Lin For the playoff run We are probably not even gonna fill that last roster spot with a vet Will be some more classic Olshey g league bullshit No doubt. We're literally the definition of the treadmill of mediocrity right now Fun regular season team, will never win a round in the playoffs. Every smart move or step forward we make is accompanied by one or two steps back We literally lucked into 3 first round picks in one season and didn't do shit with it. Regardless of who we selected with those picks, like make a trade or something. We have nothing to show for that fortune we stumbled upon https://twitter.com/adamschefter/status/1095034701402771456?s=21 Nice! Wasnt the altercation in Cleveland?

And call KD a baby back bitch Its not going to snow Dubov It wont be cold enough we are just going to get pissed on with rain I know. But maybe I can get some ice? Just enough to cancel evening activities at Beaverton Schools. The lows arent cold enough for ice. Believe me I wanted it too Just not happening God damn you and your reasoning with logic Fuck you clay we need some climate change in this bitch I gotta admit I called BS earlier last week on all of it Knicks at Cavs tonight is... well, its... something.

Loving these KD tweets. Too accurate Hey Dubov ? Great he got fouled on the last possession Doesnt make the rotation mismanagement any better Or the terrible shot selection I do not want to see anymore crunchtime Harkless ever again Aminu, fine. Hood, fine. No more crunchtime Harkless. What does it say about your team that you needed to hope for a bailout call against a mediocre team to get out if blowing a huge lead? I agree with that Dubov. Still doesn't change the blown call tho That's like when coaches say "game wasn't lost on the last play". This is true, but doesn't change the fact that we shoulda won on that last play and lost as a result Nah I dont buy that Donaghy excluded, a referee has never been the deciding factor in the outcome of a game Man PG wouldve looked good in red and black So you're saying we that didn't cost us the game? Idk how you can say that. We hit those 2 free throws it's a win As a coach thats the attitude you have to have but objectively it def cost them lol The blazers deserved to lose but they still coulda won I Lol no fucking way How many offensive possession did the blazers have that game? How many terrible shots by CJ? How many blown defensive assignments by Moe? To put it on one play is lazy and ignorant But to ignore time, score and situation in that situation is...also ignorant Lol wrong They put themselves in that situation The refs didnt If anything the refs gave them breaks on a couple phantom calls before that Im tired of this last two minutes review bullshit as if the entire game didnt build up to that. Thats ignoring how the game has been called. Both things can be true. If youre the coach of the team thats how you have to approach it. But that doesnt change the observable reality of the consequences of that missed call. Ok but a call is a call. If that play happened at the end of the third quarter nobody would be talking about it but it wouldve had the same two point swing and impact on the game. Lol Dubov take your coaching hat off for a second. Both things are true. They played like shit and deserved to lose, yes. But that's irrelevant to the last play in a vacuum. It was one play to win the game and the refs blew the call aka costed us the game Correct! But it didn't. It happened on the last play of the game with the game on the line Time and situation I agree the L2M is dumb Time and situation is a cop out The league should get rid of them, at least publicly Two points is two points Whether its 35 minutes in or 47 minutes in Call it what you want but if they blow the whistle we win If Dame knows they havent been making that call (and I know he does because hes never not talking to the refs) then that probably wasnt the best play. But thats not really on him. He should not have been sitting for the first 7 minutes of the fourth quarter. I dont have patience for excuses. You either did it right or you did it wrong and if you did it wrong you gotta own it. But its nobody elses fault Neil was right, CJ > PG..... big lol at Lamar trying to defend CJs travel saying he was doing the same thing James harden does lmao I really want Lamar to shut up about the blazers player development lol But Gundy were the youngest team in the league Were down by 15 like come on lol MY HOOS WITH A HUGE WIN Hooos house Dame and CJ combined 5 for 25 Yikes ! Felton adding salt in the wound Making it profoundly worse That was a brick by Evan ?You guys I definitely made fun of this nerd in high school Fucking Bif. Now hes living my dream of being a jeopardy champion. Karma is a bitch. Karma is definitely a cold hard Bif.

The last thing I needed this morning was joe Flacco coming to Denver You are no longer the only elite person in Denver I just read that Windy article about Lebron buying a team. Could he buy the Blazers? If we sell in 4-6 years like Canzano said, that would put the team for sale right when Lebron's playing career is ending Cant wait for rich Paul to be the gym GM But realistically I bet he buys the Cavs You really think Dan Gilbert would sell the Cavs to LeBron? If the money was good enough Follow up question: would the contract be written in comic sans? He doesnt even live in Cleveland I don't think he would. Too much pride And he doesn't need the money Other teams that could sell.. grizzlies? Suns? You think sarver would? Maybe in a hostile takeover? I think he only owns like 25% Gunz I caught a woj tell a few days ago Oooooh I saw on tweetdeck he followed the nuggets and then 60-90 seconds later he made the Isaiah tweet Do tell Confused as to why he didnt follow them in first place lol small markets Hes too busy managing his 3 phones To follow teams on twitter lol Lol ?Spotify is cold for this Thats their suggested playlist banner on the app (click in) ?Should I go see the IT return tonight Thats not a bad price NBA 2K League just signed a deal with Champion Hell yeah! It literally costs twice as much to sit center court in the 300 level tonight for blazers warriors Blazers fans are gonna be outnumbered tonight by 12 year olds in Steph Curry jerseys Also nothing brings out the Asian community like the warriors Fucking kids. That generation is just a bunch of front runners None of them will be warrior fans in 5 years Yeah dude those fan behaviors are just going to increase LeBrons fans are that way Well honestly the coverage is accurate to the point where we know theres only 2-4 teams who can win any year max So rooting for a team consistently is really deincentivized Yeah and I think most nba fans are fans of the whole league because they know so few teams can win it NBA fans are different from nfl fans in that way Vs the NFL no matter how bad your team is you can see it in the ship in 3 years Nate Jones laid this out perfectly. It's the always connected, Netflix, espn era. Some white kid in Milwaukee can buy NBA league pass and watch every single warriors game. 

Back in the day most people grew up cheering for their local team cuz A. Their family had a strong tradition of fandom and B. It was the only team they could watch games of sans the random bulls game on ESPN So regional fandom doesn't really exist anymore Yeah plus Instagram and Twitter, Reddit it doesnt matter Exactly Yah but also theres a national media that can tell you that you have no hope 20 years ago you could think your team was competative and that anything is possible Oh so that kid is Milwaukee HAS to be white!? ? Yeah but that's a different story. We don't cheer for our team just cuz we think they're gonna win. We cheer cuz it's our team I made that example for you Ian Lol I figured Brock that leads to a great example of kids wanting the easy way to everything. Cheering for a team that fucking sucks but it's your team, makes victory so much sweeter. It's the struggle to get there I think its tough to sell people on buying in on a hopeless cause But that's represented in the job market too. All these spoiled fucks want this cushy 6 figure job with catered lunch right outta college. They don't wanna grind to get that No matter the era People arent as ignorant to it. Ow But the whole reason people started cheering for a team is it's their local team Certain teams fans are going to have more fun and get better players consistently I didn't start following the blazers cuz I thought we could win it all So if you knew the blazers could never win in 30 years youd keep buying tickets You did cuz you wanted to smoke weed like Damon stoudamire If the teams were owned by the city/state Ad you could vote on the GM and management Then I think regional pride would be a reasonable thing private business baby... money maker Dude it's all regional pride idk what you're talking about Obviously the hope to win is there But I literally followed the team cuz I lived there and always will becuz of that Ppl going to games mostly want a fun experience/ seeing diff players around league. Yeah u want to see them win but its not the end of world unless its a playoff game Yah but think if youre a kid starting to watch. The fuck you want to be a hornets fan for That was Ians first fave team.. You grew up with some really cool blazers teams that really competed Idk but my teams havent changed since Im 8/9 years old Yeah and we are also lucky to live in a market that actually gives a shit about the nba Most places like Charlotte dont give a fuck I mean that's the argument I'm making Brock. Because of Instagram and the internet these soft kids just follow winners Yah but were unlucky that Portland cant compete because they dont get free agents But in the past it was never a question as to who to root for. Your local team Why the fuck are people browns fans? Cuz they live in Cleveland The structure of the league precludes the blazers from winning Yah and now people know way more Also Neil being a pussy precludes them from winning New Orleans does not give a flying fuck about the Pelicans Its not soft is realism ^ to reiterate Cuz they are a newish team.. New? Like Oklahoma City **live look at that theory getting absolutely ruined** Not really New Orleans has had the Pelicans/Hornets for longer than OKC has had the thunder tho New Orleans founded 2002, OKC 2008 Orlando Magic 1989 Omg realism isn't why your cheer for teams tho lol Thats fine but okc also hosted New Orleans after Katrina. Doesnt necessarily back my side but those fans were craving an nba team Wheres all the Magic Stans! I know the blazers will likely never win another ship. I'll still watch every game Ive actually met magic fans in the wild Theres some magic fans all over the world because of the shaq/penny teams Dwight Howard was once a top 2 player In the league Top 2 in steroid use also Behind lebron Actually idk maybe more than Lebron The 09 Magic are the PED squad of a generation Jameer Nelson def took HGH Dead giveaways are freakazoid shoulders and lower back problems way too early in their career Not really sure where all this is going but bandwagon fans are lame af. Sure you can appreciate LeBron or great teams but you dont need to change your allegiances Bandwagon fans make those franchises a shit ton of money tho Yeah I think we all agree about that, but also saying younger generations care even less about it than we did Bunky is spot on Kai was born in the wrong generation That being said I really enjoyed watching duke in their comeback New Orleans is a football town period Move that team to Seattle They should make an expansion team in Seattle and only let teams protect 4 players. Break the warriors up The warriors will be broken up next year when klay and green leave Or KD leaves And boogie will of course be leaving I high key want KD on the Knicks Oh wow chad fire take Hopefully KD wins another one this year but never again and he will ofcicaly finish with 0 earned How about 2 expansion teams 1 is Vegas and 1 in Seattle Its happening baby KD to New York, iguodala returing "Given not earned" Will KD go down in history as the biggest bitch to step on the court? Nah thats Larry bird with the whole my back hurts thing Or Grant Hill I think Raymond Felton will still be a bigger bitch than KD With the ankles Honorable mention: Sebastian Telfair Like literally hes a bigger bitch. He weighs way more. Pop quiz, how old is Sebastian telfair (no googling) 37 Pure guess but id say 39 Colder Dammit 33 31 39 is such a bitch age though Hes only 33 He was drafted at like 12 Should still be in the league! Wow I feel like he was on the blazers decades ago ?? Last played for the Fujian Sturgeons in the Chinese Basketball League He's the PG version of Sam Bowie Caused us to pass on CP3 ?For you other sneaker heads, this drops on Hulu tomorrow Did your brand really send a valentines email if they didnt use heart emojis in the ?? subject line ?? #disruptLove Omg Kanter!

Fuck those guys Lmao Ok but what was this offer sheet Wait what did we put up in the trade ? Meyers, really?! No God dammit We signed him as a free agent I think its veteran minimum But this cuts Meyers out of the rotation well, maybe. It could cut ZC out. Yeah Forgot he was a free agent Fucking Neil over here claiming Portland isnt a destination for big name free agents and then he goes and signs one. Sandbagging sonofabitch. Lol a huge free agent that was cut by the Knicks BIG. NAME. FREE. AGENT. I think weve seen the end of Harkless and Meyers playing a lot And probably Zach too And the beginning of suspicious Turkish nationalists prowling around PDX Too bad Kanter cant play tonight vs. KD & Boogie. Would love to see that shit talking. Ill see you guys at pioneer courthouse square for the championship parade! Homeland: PDX We got any good Turkish restaurants in PDX? We got hella Lebanese/halal But not Turkish I dont think Yeah theres some great Lebanese food but not the same. No, Ive never even heard of a Turkish restaurant in PDX Sleeper cell. Interesting. Wow Yall call me racist The Rip City Muslim Brotherhood has never been stronger Dubov sandbaggers have a spot in this world What is Dr Hs prognosis of the Kanter Trade ? ? You cant win a playoff series unless you tighten up the rotation. Well see if Terry can do it. I love the kanter trade... this is best thing to happen since we bet the rockets in the playoffs The end of the Meyers Leonard era has begun So hes going to wear 00?? Wonder how dame feels I dont think he can He can but he shouldnt Yeah we gotta get my man another number I hope he picks 77 Too bad our top 10 pick can't even crack the top 8 lol We still talkin MySpace?

Who does this guy think he is Kenny Mauer aint here for Draymonds bullshit I love that they're dragging Pierce right now lmao Props to Klay for actually shooting that Honestly I think the best part of being an NBA player would be always having somebody rebound for you when youre getting shots up What a luxury Holy shit Dubov youre right Nurk shouldve argued that he lost possession and then got it back No different than Beal Dame gonna need every ounce of that biofreeze after this game Hey Cam kindly tell Turner he can suck out collective dicks Yes Kanter and Collins Fuck Meyers Lmao refs let it get to this point but I hope Zach beats Klays ass Lol theyre saying on the broadcast that Collins is heated cuz they signed kanter Lmao Steph let him by I think its pretty obvious which curry brother is better Cant wait to lose this lead Also where is our first unit Zach just called Klay Thompson a hoe lmaooo https://twitter.com/nbcsnorthwest/status/1095921753119805440?s=21 Thats just some good old fashioned eastern Washington banter Terry is fucking killing me with these rotations. I still don't know why Lillard closes out the 3rd every game He should follow Kerr's lead. He pulls curry with 2 minutes left in the 3rd then puts him back in with 8 minutes in the 4th Shoutout to the kid in the warriors jersey and his brother in the blazers jersey with a sign that says meet my brother, the traitor. WHY IS THE SECOND UNIT DTILL IN FUCK YOU TERRRRYYYY Under 5 minutes and we have Curry, Hood, ET, Layman, and Collins Evan Turner needs to go Terry has no fucking clue what he's doing Here comes the warriors first unit... and Dame He's like drunk coked out Denzel in flight.

LETS FUCKING GOOOOO Did Layman drop all 17 in the second half? ?? 14 I think Simons dunk fest please What an absolute bukakke Klay is a bitch, barking on the sideline at ZC ? I love Dame talking to Zach on the walk back to the bench. Is Jake Layman good? Im all here for it Cant wait to toss Kanter into the mix. Cant wait to remove Meyers from the mix Zach with some solid late game blocks and flagrant flops. I fucks wit layman Zach added that showmanship You need it at the playoff/big stage Meyers could never be that good at selling calls Meyers is a fucking robot.

Especially since they have his old coach Someone made a good point yesterday, the suns have Devin Booker they're paying $30 mil a year, last years #1 and #10 picks, and 2017's #4 pick and they have less wins than the Cavs whom have who exactly They have Cedi & Sauce so your point is what exactly?! Lmao literally a team of g leaguers and outcasts Wes? ? ? Girth Brooks! BAHAHA Holy shit that was the greatest thing I've ever read haha Lmao Jimmy Haslam ended Flying Js sponsorship agreement with ESPN because they wrote a not-so-favorable article about him and the Browns. Petty ass motherfucker. https://twitter.com/jonesonthenba/status/1096111461825277952?s=21 PREACH! is there a discernible difference between long term and short term? Like Duke is always good so are those bandwagon fans now just actual fans? You mean Yankees fans Right. Lakers fans. Never really thought about it like that but to your point - there are a lot of Lakers,cowboys and yankee fans because they originally jumped on the bandwagon Is that a veiled shot at LeBron? Not really but I guess he counts as a bandwagon fan. Gundy you should ask him why hes a bandwagon fan for the wire That will go really well Lol Gundy do it for the people Also for the record it seems like LeBron has switched his allegiances to the Browns Even though Baker planted a flag at midfield of his alma mater? Fair weather fan. Why didn't he switch that allegiance when they were winless lol Lebron and drake are one in the same https://twitter.com/mrmichaellee/status/1095933201514676225?s=12 Wrong. Even if the call was wrong he doesnt have the right to go crazy on Ken Mauer. Ken Mauer is a veteran official and one of the best in the league. He gave Draymond a very long leash last night on some bullshit because hes a pro who doesnt take shit personally. Stomping his feet around like a 4-year old who didnt finish their broccoli and as such didnt get dessert. He looked like Jordan Belfort lol ? Dame going all in on biofreeze https://twitter.com/dame_lillard/status/1096119686134001664?s=12 Wonder if the comish is going to force him to cover it up Supreme sleeve tattoo? Theyll probably make him cover it up if he continues to promote it haha Wow Wait he actually got a bio freeze tattoo? Lmao Actually though? Nooooo That's fucking awesome Im not sure if thats the sponsor but timing seems it may be I hope it's a new one Something controversial ? ? O I hope its leupold then If its Leupold do I have to stand up and applaud every time hes on the court? If anybody is getting a Leupold tattoo its gonna be Meyers Stolen Valor Leonard ?????? https://twitter.com/shamscharania/status/1096164892057522176?s=21 https://twitter.com/heytherejeffro/status/1095445818918690816?s=12 Melo to Lakers baby Actually?

Why didn't Demps just take the lakers offer lol Cause ownership/Loomis said fuck la That was a great fucking offer. They're letting their emotions get in the way of sound business eh maybe Id rather have taytom And laker offer might be there same exact terms Theyre not getting him! Ball
Holiday
Ingram
Kuzma
Randle

With 2 unprotected lakers firsts coming is a pretty good salvage of the situation Its Danny ainge! Yeah Ainge ain't trading Tatum. Especially if Kyrie leaves. They'll go all in on the young guys. Then it'll only be the lakers left and they'll have all the leverage What about danny ainges career would ever indicate hed give up on a star Well hed also trade anyone for a better player Ainge wouldnt do Tatum straight up + cap fill for AD? But never anybody good! Or someone who is great You think Tatum alone is better than the lakers offer? I bet the offer caps at Smart, Horford, Jaylen Brown and Rozier Or same offer but swap Horford for Hayward Yeah Ainge is gonna fuck the Pels This is all a credit to Ainge Which is why I would never want to deal with him February Ainge: Oh yeah sure, sure. Well definitely include Tatum, Brown, and Rozier.
July Ainge: Jayson who? Not sure who youre referring to. Heres all Horford, though. It's the same as dealing with bellicheck. You don't do it. If they agree to it you're clearly getting fucked Yeah Ainge was whispering sweet nothings in Demps ear and it worked. He'll have amnesia come July Oh, sorry. That deal was only valid with Dell. Non-transferrable. You understand. Also Chris Mannix, who basically works for the Celtics front office, reported that Ainge has never put Tatum explicitly on the table So the narrative is already in place for him to not be included Yeah I think everybody knows how this is gonna play out lol Yah but that same lakers deal could still be there But if the Celtics won't do Tatum, the deal is trash. Then NO comes crawling back to the Lakers and the leverage switches Magic could be like yeah the picks are off the table now sorry. You can have all the young guys tho The Lakers deal will look different. Theyre gonna say No, you shouldve taken this deal when we offered it to you. Now it looks like this. Yeah and then the Lakers can be like hey No picks Or 1 pick And we keep Lonzo Yah but you can say well fuck you weve fucked ourselves already to not deal with you you know we wont do a bad deal just to do it Jump on the grenade? I like that. Except the Lakers win that situation anyway because they know AD will come there in FA. BUT its a year later and LeBron is a year older. Maybe. Thats a ways away Eh idk Dubov. That's a slippery slope It's a game of chicken at that point Im talking in circles somebody take my coffee away from me Yes a game of chicken I don't think the lakers punt another offseason But he pels have so much less to lose Theyll max Jimmy Man I wish Jimmy would just go away. Im tired of hearing his name. Does jimmy wanna play with lebron? Yeah his schtick wore out quick For real Mr. Butler doesnt have the luxury to pick anymore People already saying hes not getting a max Maybe like 2/48 yeah he kinda fucked himself Can we s&t for him? If the Sixers want Meyers Leonard? Send ET back to the promise land. With Collins and Simons Dame, CJ, Jimmy, Kanter, Nurk would be kinda sick lol Id still role w jimmy roll Just copped Blazers/Nuggets tickets April 5th!

He won everyone knows who he is now Lol dude empire was a huge show people already knew who he was His career is over Def not 9/10 Americans would have no clue Nobody is giving this guy work again I have no idea Still dont know We will see! There is such a thing as negative publicity His cell mate definitely gonna know who he is Even if a show runner or director would be willing to cast him He fucked over all the networks His ass is grass Nah he just 100x his profile Everyone knows who he is now Not to mention the entire city of Chicago wants to ACTUALLY beat his ass. This is the dumbest take of the century Sean Penn beat the shit outta Madonna and hes still relevant Lol okay Ian He wouldnt be if it happened in 2019... Dude Harvey Weinstein is now a household name That doesnt mean he boosted his profile Such a diff crime Totally But being solely associated with something very negative Is not good Jared fogel Maybe he can be in like a reality tv show later Nah I think he's in prison My Main point is that he committed a crime that had no specific victim and one that could easily be forgiven Meanwhile every person in the country is talking about him I dont know his name and we are talking about him right now Including the president I dont think anyone is rushing to cast him I think if he made a false statement And t got out of hand Maybe But he carried this out for like a month He went on USA Today Hes still trying to claim its legit! Thats a magazine No one is gonna touch this guy and this is the only thing hell ever be known for Also unless youre claiming he was trying to get caught He is in fact like Its possible The worlds biggest fucking idiot Not a genius Not to mention Its sounds like This was his second attempt at this Already planning a big apology talk about fame addiction and a interview tour Since he sent that letter That no one will go to except for hardcore empire fans Hahah dude no! I do t think you realize how upset people are over this And every time MAGA supporters bring this up to legitimize there own victimhood Which will be every ten seconds People are just gonna get pissed off again Also saying he got caught lying on purpose Is some straight up Alex jones shut Shit Lol I think youre over reacting I mean the world will keep turning But nobody is gonna support this guy Black twitter aint taking this too well Black Twitter isnt real life Real life isnt taking this too well lol We will see The only things hes done is cement himself as a MAGA supporter talking point over the next couple years I think if he goes to jail And then gets out People would accept his apology maybe But that is A hell of a long play Im not advocating for jail time for non violent offenders personally But thats the only way I can imagine anyone coming around Im with Ian. I think this guy really fucked himself. No they didnt fuck him they poured bleach on him, its different So did they actually pour bleach on him or is that just what his false statement said? No they actually did all that he just paid them to One of the many reasons the cops were suspicious about it Was when they went to the scene our man Jussie happened to know where all the security cameras were There very well could be a video of them acting out the fake assault And if there is I deeply hope they release it! Lol downtown Chicago is a lot of things MAGA country is not one of them https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bbc.com/news/amp/technology-47326561 Tee hee hee I'm with Ian. The guy is totally fucked. And we're certainly gonna see this a million times on Fox News in the next 2 years Ha Matt I saw that and assumed it was an ad campaign Maybe it is if so they got me ! Haha that just seems like something Id see in an advertising deck Lets make a major character into the CEO Followed by a photoshopped image of the New York Times with that headline https://entertainment.theonion.com/jussie-smollett-arrives-in-court-wearing-full-body-cast-1832800613#_ga=2.254122126.70174109.1550792285-403527077.1550792285 Who?

The blazers Mike breen just said "lowkey" Lost 10 bucks on blazers +3.5 so I bet 25 on Blazers +13.5 live When the hell did Jeremy Lin go to Toronto How many teams has been traded to He got released by the hawks before the deadline Kawhi and his giant hands .... Is that a ref you suck chant? Canada doesnt know anything about sports I just think its cute Its not very Canadian of them Having health care doesnt build character Surely theyll apologize Sorrey Sorrey for using the s-word That was piss poor clock management by the blazers Lets get the quick 2 and foul Dubovs fifth graders could do better !! What the fuck was CJ thinking on that three with 24 seconds? Lillard finally getting superstar foul calls Ugh Brutal This new KawhiOS sucks We will beat Houston. The blazers lost but I profited on them once again God dammit We are a better basketball team than Houston. If Denver gets the 1 seed we could make the WCF ?At least our social team is funny Or we snag the 3 seed Two very winnable games coming up. Could finish 6-1 on this road trip which is way better than expected. If we want the 3 seed we gotta win these next two Absolutely 4OT between two ass teams is not something anybody needs I definitely watched the last Ot, it was terrible but Im glad I saw some of it Hawks just too fatigued Mike Budenholzer always looks like he has to fart but is worried it might be a shart. ?

Im just doing me The thing with AB is he absolutely isnt doing him You can tell how hard hes trying Its so lame.

Its not AB Its Mr Big Chest now Totally agree Clay AB is on some crazy drugs the way he acting Yes Lmao Trae got ejected for the dumbest shit Nba is soft as butter Maybe warmed butter but if its in the fridge butter kinda hard Shit I just checked the butter in my fridge and youre right Its actually something that really gets me pissed Fuck butter ?

Wait follow up question since LinkedIn answers my first one Are you Spencers boss now? Haha i dont find what my area is for a few months. Wow I hope it includes multnomah village Oh you a suit for Starbucks Dehaan??? Is that the stores hes at? Congrats homie I forgot he is still there! Thanks buddy, dont think I have to wear a full suit anymore, not for sure but think I can leave that game with Macys Dude thats awesome, congrats dude! Dubov, do you still watch bachelor? For some reason I thought you used too Yeah I do unfortunately This season has been absolute dogshit Lol right there with you, and this seasons no bueno Totally Colton is garbage Dude didnt even really play in the nfl he was on a practice squad Haha Jesse Palmer beat nfl bachelor Who do you want to be the bachelorette? Colton is a little bitch Eight fucking weeks theyve been building up this episode and he finally jumped over the fence big deal I dont even watch and I know this shit. Thats how much they built it up. Haha seriously. They havent had any good things, its been that or the virgin card. Cam, are you
Guys close to the mansion? No. Its up in the Malibu hills. I aint rich Cassie was my pick the first night and she *spoiler alert* fucked it up. I also picked the sloth girl though so what the hell do I know Apparently the bachelor and bachelorette ghosts of seasons past can still be found roaming the streets of LA though. Just looking for that final rose ?Me watching Colton talk about being a virgin Lebron looks 50 in that photo Lebron looks like old thanos They flew Cassies dad to Portugal?!? He looks like he just shot up that sweet, sweet black tar heroin Lol yeah they did dehaan Wow lucky guy getting a free trip. Im sure a phone call wouldnt have worked The Celtics revisionist history on the Simmons pod is hilarious. They went from treating them like an impending dynasty to we probably shouldve lost to the bucks and Sixers last year we werent that good. Damn, Nike finalizing deal to be Olympics 2028 and USA team sponsor Yeah bro. You really think were about to let some other motherfuckers come to LA and own the moment? Damn you guys already own the moment? Is the conversation still up for grabs? DisruptThePodium nope. You missed your moment to own the moment. But what about owning the conversation? DisruptTheConversation Do you guys own the moment and the conversation? Bc im trying 2 own the conversation You can have your bitchass moment Youre doing it right now Nah, were trying to be part of the conversation, not own it. Its inauthentic to own the conversation. Thats loser talk ? Happy birthday there Mr Michael. Thank you very much Mr Cam! Oh yeah happy birthday dude is that why you were such a party animal last night Haha I told guys Im trying to make a bigger contribution in 2019 Not saying it will be good contribution Yeah jimmy and I said it like 3 hours ago so you guys are shitty friends I mean i think in the last 2 days you have contributed about 10% of your total of last year so you are on the right track Does Brock keep track in his data of who doesnt wish everyone a happy birthday in the domino wishes? I sure hope so It must be factored into your friend score You didnt say it in the JCSL so you that means you didnt say it. What are you sending personal birthday texts now? Touch Dubov Im going rouge Im off the grid now At least you didnt wish him a happy birthday in your other group text Oh man if there was member overlap between group texts I would probably leave one. Woah you got that many friends huh? Look out everyone Its the like how the WAGs and side pieces sit on opposite sides of the arena at NBA games. You cant let that shit overlap. So who is the WAG and who is the side piece in this situation? If you have to ask... Touch ?? Cameron I dont know if you know this but Im fairly popular. I have over 700 Twitter followers and even more LInkedIn Connections. ?? Well my 454 Twitter followers are quality individuals Mine are not. Neither are my LinkedIn connections. Quality over quantity - something losers lean on for reassurance I work in sales all of my linkedin connections are pieces of shit I also have many attractive women DMing name on Instagram with messages like Hey whats up or How you doing handsome and based on their 0 followers and 0 posts I can only assume they very recently legitimately joined Instagram and their first order of business was to seek out fine gentlemen such as hmyself. I know we have some Stoolies in here and at the risk of pissing you off and having you send an army of Stoolies at me, this is objectively hilarious https://twitter.com/miel/status/1102688419556159489?s=12 DeHaan make sure you tell Starbucks its your birthday. They might give you a free coffee!!!!! I read that Dubov Its really funny Also it was interesting that seems like something that is more done on Twitter, not just a barstool thing. I found it interesting for sure Yeah it definitely seems like Twitter didnt do their due diligence here. But Barstool definitely has their backs against the wall because of accumulating violations and theyre trying to get out of it. Yes but overall this is an issue in the process and how big sites can get out of it Thats what I see here more than just barstool. This girl is obviously gonna hate barstool I dont like barstool either, I just like PMT But I also dont need to freak out and act like its the devil and theyre all racist and sexist because one or two people there suck I would say that most of the people there suck and if they dont suck theyre turning a blind eye to the behavior and policies of the people who do suck which makes them just as sucky. But the issue here is that Barstool messed up, apologized for it, then later down the road realized it had more impact than they thought and tried to get out of it through some questionable tactics. I mean I see a lot of the content they put out, most of their people are just young kids getting their toes wet into the media world Absolutely. But those young kids entering the media world should probably be taught the correct way to walk back mistakes instead of kicking it over to their Michael Cohen-esque legal team to fix. Yeah totally, Im also guessing this is done by a lot of big organizations This practice seems too obvious to think just barstool does this Totally. But when your big organization has a shitty reputation when it comes to dealing with women, maybe be extra thoughtful. I dont know Miel but Ive heard her on enough podcasts to assume shes generally a reasonable person. She didnt go looking for this fight and Im willing to bet if they had been honest with her from the jump about it being an honest mistake and they couldnt risk another violation, she probably wouldve been more willing to work with them on it. But offering her a $50 gift card to their online store and then going back to Twitter with legal action probably not the best move Yeah totally I mean if she responded no I wonder what would be different It seems like theyd still take the course of action they did lol Yeah fuck Jack Dorsey Miel also seems like she wouldnt like any of us in this group chat or the things we talk about Im gonna be a dick about this but I also hate seeing people complain about something with a massive bias Shes been on All Fantasy Everything a bunch of times and shes generally ok with dumb bro banter But Barstool is a different level Yeah it definitely is To me theres a massive difference between targeting barstool because you dont like their brand of humor and reacting to barstool violating content rights and then harassing you about it Also you see big cat responding to that? The supeliga has matured! I didnt see it, no Hes on the thread pretty high up Said hed love to get her side of this and said people need to chill out on her and that its fucked up what Barstool did I think Big Cat is gonna leave in the next few years ah yes I just found it And hes right, Twitter isnt the forum to deal with it Big Cat & PFT are smart dudes and I like them but I cant justify promoting their brand by downloading/listening. I think youre right, theyre gonna bounce at some point in the future now that theyve built up their own personal brands on a larger scale Ive heard that for awhile tho, you think within next 12 months ? I would hope so. I dont know how much more benefit they get out of staying. I dont think it happens that quick, and I also think Big Cat looks more towards the future than PFT does Doing the ARod Corp pod and going on Dan Patrick and things like that, hes looking at other avenues for sure Blazers cover no problem tonight. Am I right Gundy? Already locked it in this morning Line dropped by a point over the day We are on the Oregon trail, driving a COVERED wagon I also got lucky today, took Celtics +8 before they announced Klay is out and the line dropped 2 points Lucky huh God look at our blazers off to a great start Not as great but we can def get the cover up 2 at half Blazers looking a little tired this half CJ gotta carry us CJ LETS GOOO Terry called a timeout, holy hell were gonna win! Its really a damn shame that Travis Outlaw isnt still on the blazers. He would really thrive in this close game at Memphis. Well fuck Aminu needs to fucking go Im over his bullshit Cant count on him for shit Trade him and harmless for Blake griffin Jesus Christ s/o to mike Conley. Hes a real one. Killing it for my fantasy team Tv has been turned off Yup... the blazers need to come home Reboot time Great road trip Really great road trip Im not upset about this loss I bet we go 13-5 the rest of the way I'm upset. Can't take games for granted! 5-2 road trip is so much better than it shouldve been Im not gonna be Lamar Hurd and make excuses for the team but they just played 9 of their last 10 on the road And Mike Conley is always a beast but tonight he was extraordinary So my point is: ??????? Now, if we drop upcoming games to the Suns, Lakers, Wolves, Pelicans, then Im gonna be pissed. Yeah 5-2 is fucking great. But... we shoulda been 6-1 That's a bad loss we couldve and possibly shouldve lost the Nets and Celtics games too. Its easy to play that game. Yeah but that's all in the past. We won those and had one game in front of us to finish 6-1. Can't piss away those games I mean the Memphis game is in the past now, too. Yeah lol and we blew it I'm just saying you can't win a bunch in a row then say ah it's chill if we lose. We shouldn't have won those others ? That's how you become an average team Oh boy. I have bad news for you chad We are an average team. No shit And you're satisfied I mean, Im not not satisfied. That's a terrible mentality You just said it's cool we lost that game cuz we finished 5-2 Hey man, not all of us are blessed to be nuggets fans lol I never said its cool we lost a game I said that was a great road trip which I think everybody would agree is true Sure I think we shouldve beat the Grizzlies but I also think we shouldve lost to the Celtics, Raptors, Nets, and Sixers so overall Im really satisfied with the road trip Nah I feel that lol. Before the trip I would have been stoked with 5-2. But expectations change as games are completed. Once we're 5-1, that's behind us. You have one game in a vacuum against a bottom 5 team and you lose, which cancels out a win you had over a good team like the Celtics Just saying that's how good teams set themselves apart. Once you're playing with house money you still have to beat the teams you should beat, or the past big wins were for nothing And I feel like the blazers do that a lot. We win huge games against good teams, then lose against shitty teams and end up .500 Ok but nothing in the NBA happens in a vacuum Lol yes it does If you have one team in front of you, beat them It was 0-0 to start the game Lmao There isn't some statistical force up against the blazers that they had to lose tonight to regress to the mean This isnt a video game dude Yeah they were at full strength against a bad team. Good teams win those games is all I'm saying so there are absolutely no other factors at play besides the fact that its a basketball game in a vacuum? That's not what I'm saying at all. But once we're sitting at 5-1 playing a shit team, your expectations shouldn't be "well I woulda been stoked if we went 5-2 beforehand so stats say we can drop this game and be happy" 5-2 assumes we beat the grizzlies and lose to the raptors and Celtics. We beat the Celtics so you have to beat the shitty teams to make that win worth it Or so our win at the Warriors in December wasnt worth it because we lost tonight? Nope. All null and void now. ? Wait so what happened to chuck, Ernie and Kenny on TNT? ITS PLAYERS ONLY BABY They only do Thursdays until the playoffs and they also have to do march madness Ah https://twitter.com/mospeights16/status/1103166106414534657?s=21 JCSL Poll:

Do you feel shame while waiting in line for the stalls at work? Ive never felt shame for that. Im a serial work shitter Whoa I will reroute and pretend I was just in the bathroom to wash my hands If the stalls are crowded x Im with Ian I reroute and get some paper towel to blow my nose then wash my hands Bro me too I feel so much less alone rn Yes Seeing you say that gave me such a sense of confidence going forward Not to wait to shit, thats too scary If I am in the bathroom to shit I dont have time to wait. I have to find an open stall asap Theres a comedian or something that talks about that like oh when I shit, its always an emergency I think Louis CK Wow poor taste much ? When I masturbate in front of my subordinates its always an emergency for them Im actually really bummed he was so weird Yeah I dont wait. Ill come back later. Lol do you ever knock? Everything ok in there? Unfortunately Barstool Sports has idiots in our company much like many other companies and those idiots acted like idiots, Portnoy said. I regret our lawyer offering a 50 dollar gift card to our store not because its illegal in any manner but its just so moronic and makes us look like assholes. Thats why lawyers should not be on social media. Damn Not sure I would want to work for a boss that publicly called me an idiot https://twitter.com/sinow/status/1103375192481382400?s=21 Lmao Pffft I actually think Boston IS a legitimate contender If were gonna call anyone other than GS a legitimate contender No love for the Bucks and Raptors? I think theyre both legit. Barring injury. I mean those are also legitimate contenders Im just saying Yeah I would get mad about Boston getting called a contender but I also picked them to win before the season Oh wow Kylers combine height may have been doctored! I wish Portland could get that respect but we gotta win a playoff game first I mean all Im saying is Boston is a threat to come
Out of the east Def agree Boston also in the east Lol u got swept my the pelicans Makes it a bit different That same Pels team is probably a 4 seed in the west this year Boston smashed philly (better than the pelicans) and went 7 with Cleveland (better than the pelicans) JUST SAYING We literally just washed Boston on their home floor Its easier to compare it now Ian but that Pelicans team was playing really well at that time, idk if Philly wouldve beat them in a 7 game series I dont know but I feel very confident! Thats fair Philly was completely dominant to end the season Remember Im with you if anything Im too negative on the Zers They were on like record setting win streak They also didnt even have Embiid horford owns Embiid seemed like the difference Anthony Davis was also playing out of his mind, along with Rondo and Jrue Literally none of these teams looks the same this year so idk how much comparing you can really do The blazers also choked it is what it is, Im just saying Boston has earned the benefit of the doubt When it comes tot he palyoffa When it comes to the playoffs* Yeah thats what I said. But Portland is better this year than last year. Its not the same team This road trip was possibly the best ball Ive seen them play since the year we beat Houston What are the MAJOR differences? I guess well see IRONICALLY For starters, Dame doesnt have to carry the team on his back to get wins CONTINUITY IS THE MAJOR DIFFERENCE And nurkic is just better #NAME? Lol Thats a pretty goddamn loose definition of different team The scoring is more balanced And the wing rotation is better Its basically the exact same team performing at a statistically similar level But they got better Harkless is finally healthy and Layman gives them another big wing Theyre gonna win more games this year than last year Gundy just revealed himself as an FO mole. I think the blazers are and were better than how they performed in the playoffs last year Also last year their offense was average and this year its elite But the blazers roster is mostly the same and their growth doesnt seem drastic Whats your list of teams zers lose to in playoffs Gundy and Ian In the west Denver, Golden State and OKC I think we lose to HOU Yeah Denver, GS, okc and Houston I feel v confident Yall lose Same Zers could beat denver Same I think Nurkic gives us a better shot against Houston and Ill take my chances with the refs in the playoffs against harden I think Jokic is too tough for nurkic I think Houston is back to form Yeah Houston is clicking We can bully them quite a bit tho It would be a tight series PJ tucker cant handle nurkic if they do that small ball shit Alright man I just dont see it You think Houston in 5? Yeah thats what I was gonna say maybe 6 You guys have two good hoards but they have two better guards I see what youre saying with tucker But capella could also swallow Nurk up I dont think so Nurkic is a battering ram against slight centers He feasts on the Capelas and Jarrett Allens of the world At least he does now He didnt before Lol he also made Hassan Whiteside look like wilt chamberlain Hassan is a better matchup tho Its weird Capela is a better player but worse against nurkic KEEP JAS NAME OUT YO MOUF Hassan Whiteside is capable of being a better player portland could do to portland what no did to them last year I believe I was there for Hassan Chamberlain.

That couldnt have been more ball though Fuck we are so cold tonight We should be up 14 with all these missed 3s Totally agree on that, never said he was good at decision making CJ SURGING AB to the bills lol Just landed in Kansas City Steelers are the ultimate trolls Nurk getting in Westbrook's head lmao Clearly stuck his foot out Def pokes it a bit Who cares Legendary I love it Gamesmanship baby Its hilarious Wow HOMECOURT!

Me too Gotta change my shorts before the 2nd half starts Not saying I agree but recognition feels so nice It's glorious I just took mine off for this halftime show at this point It's kinda like when Hayden was listed top 10 in the Sigep sexy list. We all knew it wasn't true but he loved the recognition BAHAHAHA Lol Wasnt chuck a Reebok guy? Ope. Nope. Ignore me Nike guy for sure I wonder if Rovell has the scoop on sketchers stock after chuck said it was trash Their dig at Nike was trash They love really tan Ken on TNT Where's Nurk rank amongst Centers now?

Yeah Olshey is a cocksucker but he deserves credit for Nurk at 12 mil Is this players only? I can listen to these dudes for hours.

Im high on sports Man Landed in KC Took the Uber to a jazz club As one does Some guy bought me a martini People in KC Love to hype up KC Uber driver was firing off the facts Oh man you ever been to Portland? Lol I grew up in the northwest Im v familiar with the insane sense of superiority, and baseless belief that the rest of the country is jealous However I dont think thats the vibe in KC When are we gonna put Meyers in to close this out Shut up Chad I audibly laughed, well done ? You gotta give me a trigger alert dude Oh good an Aminu corner brick under two minutes. Just what I was hoping for. He hasnt made one all night Those kinds of possessions kill us We have ourselves a game here boys What the fucking fuck Wish somebody would fucking box out. Wish that 13 guy was in black and red Dont think theres been a box out all quarter George Paul? Any relation to Logan> Lillard hitting a 3, 2.4 left. Game. Terry is drawing up the ATO for a Meyers 3 ball as we speak Nurk mad now Is Nurk gone?! Nurk gone He got away with goaltending for sure We getta pick the shooter now? Hmmmm Interesting Meyers I think it's gotta be someone off the bench Meyers! He is a 40/50/90 guy They should get someone from the G league ? Meyers Lmao Reggie playing fast and loose with the term headbutt This would be a fiesty first round. Just saying. Ohhh opposing coach picks This is so dumb. The Nurk trip should have been a flagrant Billy is picking Layman. Little does he know Jake has a 10 inch hog and ice water in his veins Its Meyers Omg Skallllll Anyone on the bench Jesus Christ Cut this guy Wait wait What Wow lol Swanigan wouldve made it What the fuck kinda rule is that lmao Jordan bell would've made it Am I behind?

Shut up!!! Dame time! This is destiny Fuck I hate to say it guys, but we're gonna get some Meyers in OT Dammit housed NyQuil at the start of the fourth anticipating it being over in 4. Good think NyQuil is a placebo effect! NyQuil is the real deal man I doubt a horse tranquilizer would take you down mark. Everything is a placebo. Brock, what actually is NuQuil Its gremlin jizz Hahahaha cam Damn Nurk being out is a bit scary PG or Westbrook gettin Td and tossed. Fuck outta here. Late call I need Collins over Kanter here For the defense Damn Im like 20 seconds behind Agreed Kanter is useless right now Are u sure its not the NyQuil Collins cant fowl out in 2:54 Wanna bet No I do not God CJ is anti clutch Has he ever made a big shot? Welp No he hasnt. I think that if you call And 1! but you miss the bucket you should only get one FT instead of two. Welp Lets hope this OT tired em out and they get blown by the clips Sucks getting swept but what can you do? We swept them last year, didnt we? That we did Fuck this https://twitter.com/oregonian/status/1103906300650414080?s=12 wow talk about salt on the wounds Memphis loss hurts even more now Yeah Dubov remember that loss We'd be tied with OKC right now if we won lol wed also be another half game back if Steve Kerr hadnt tossed a clipboard two weeks ago whats your point Wed also be ANOTHER half game back if we hadnt beat LeBron opening night. You wanna keep going? Gotta win the gimmes! Its the tnt curse guys we hardly ever win when we are on tnt.

Joevon Catron SuperLovitz Tat race: the race for a full sleeve In theatres June Man am I the only one in the superliga with a tattoo? Only on Hulu : has live sports JA Morant takes? Solid player. Definitely a top 10 talent but remains to be seen how he plays in a system. Thats not a take Dubov Cut out this reasonable shit Alright heres your take: hes gonna have a better nba career than Lonzo and Trae Will win a slam dunk contest but otherwise disappoint Ive never seen him play a full game but I love the take because of how hot it is Rengel Good take Rengel Oh I think He will be good, but dont be surprised if he is bad! Hopefully hell be sick but I have no clue haha We need to eliminate but I wouldnt be surprised From take culture Its an auto hedge A maroneyism Most takes are baseless except chuck and Kenny crowning the blazers Thanks Ian Preach God damn the ducks cant buy a bucket right now Or get a rebound They got both there tho Yeah youre right Sco ducks Was gonna joke Darren carringtons sister is on Stanford but she actually is Lol klay calling out warriors fans is great https://twitter.com/dimeuproxx/status/1104959846162427904?s=21 https://twitter.com/thehoopcentral/status/1104953317296205824?s=21 ?

Im praying for a heat bucks series So I can go to Milwaukee for a game Well I think this is probably as good a time as any to announce to you guys that Im also running for President in 2020. See you all in Milwaukee. So jimmy and I are obviously voting for trump again but I think the rest of the superliga should back a candidate now and get some momentum. I think we can really make an impact in this election. I cant decide between getting behind the candidate(s) I agree with most on policy, or the one(s) I think have the best shot at beating trump. Im getting behind the candidate that has the best value on online gambling sites Tbh I might just put money on trump lol If he doesnt go down with this mueller shit hes gonna win Put $20 on Kamala +3200 last summer Barf I dont like Kampalas politicssuper centristbut I think shed do well in the debates.

Fuck those shoes. OBJ Motherfucker sends me the wrong size, every time Send him a blood boy who wears the same size as him i dont work on football anymore so in the words of Leslie Chow... Not. My. Problem. ? Anybody else watch his standup by the way? It was ok. Definitely skippable. Idk I was more of a fan of his work in the masked singer Yeah I thought it was shit Curious if I was just being hyper critical He basically stretched 15 minutes of material into an hour special. And only talked about his experience on the hangover Frank Gore keep getting them checks Crowder getting paid too Classic jets move Apparently the OT the Bengals signed is a bum ? Desean Jackpot Records Jackson back on the Eagles Excuse its Jaccpot** Because hes a crip https://twitter.com/southbaylakers/status/1105211639790415872?s=12 whos picking up Andre for their post season run I mine as well at this point The best Ingram on the Lakers Does the Superliga have any takes on Wofford -7.5? Nba games are uninspiring to me but that line is intriguing 7.5 is a lot in a conference championship but Wofford absolutely smoked UNCG both times they played. I would ride it. Fletcher Magee gonna splash tonight. Lets do it Gundy I fear that I have led you astray. Magee only has 12 and Wofford goes as he goes. I didnt throw down too much Your first reaction was right Too big a spread for a conference title game Questionable travel Highly questionable Hoover getting harden calls We might have a chance here Ya starting to look like uncg is about to implode Lol Marques Chriss just saw his life flash before his eyes Yes!!! Wofford!!! Gundy on bad beat watch I need Wofford to come through, I pump faked a bet on my Cavs that would have paid Hot take: Wofford will be the tournament darling going in but lose to a team like Minnesota in the first round But that being said, I wouldn't be surprised if they went deep is Minnesota even going to make the tournament? The maroney hedge truly is a beautiful thing. Now we can never be wrong They are projected to be a 10 Wofford a 7 But if they lose their first tourney game theyll probably be out I only ask because Minnesota is absolute trash I agree but they have a decent net ranking Nice cover Gundy Net ranking is the dumbest fucking thing in sports Youre right Rengel Im looking at bracketology and theyre projected 10 You were right! I agree Dubov - the committee keeps changing their criteria so they can pick all the power 5 teams ?For posterity's sake Oh my god He's not wrong Not at all! How could he be!? Dont knock my boy he is a big supporter of the tbt team Dr. Hedge Maroney is a god damn superhero Did he think he was addressed in that tweet?!!! Smart draft people I was thinking the same thing lmao ?This meme is made for a very specific Venn diagram of twitter users and I love squarely in that camp Norse wow Zags covered by 1 ? Wow did you get this off memes for Dubov dot com Yes Wowowow ? https://twitter.com/jjsportsbeat/status/1105317021686751234?s=21 Lmao they interviewed the fan. What is going on Dude gotta hear both sides Haha that's ridiculous Never a lack of action in the association ?The other side Haha Im kidding about the fan I definitely believe he said some racist shit I mean look at his hat come on Exactly the hat is all I needed to know Lmao Russ said hed fuck him and his wife up ?????? I didn't know there were non Mormons in Utah Shane looks like he's picked up a hooker at a Pilot gas station before Wow Russ doubled down. This is great. What's the odds on this guy getting banned from the arena for life? Silver's gonna launch a full on investigation ? https://twitter.com/jemelehill/status/1105466987352862720?s=12 The best one is : Ive never met a black jazz fan Ummm have you ever been to New Orleans?? I heard that MAGA tweet may be photoshopped That was my initial thought U know as soon as that guy went on tv he got doxxed to the max Prob would have happened immediately If real Oh it happened live on twitter tho Like as soon as the interview went on people were retweeting his shit and he locked his account Yeah but people can spin up fake tweets just as fast Yeah it seems a little off tbh ?This one I'm pretty sure is real tho Yeah Did russ pay him and this is all staged?? That feels more legit #maga framed again smh Lol lets hope this isnt becoming a thing https://twitter.com/derikstevenson/status/990105426191532033?s=21 Here's the real tweet that Shane replied to too But yeah MAGA hoax again Click the one I sent its a video of all his tweets The Jemele Hill one? She deleted it I think that video was fake O ok never mind I mean does the guy have a ton of MAGA tweets Or does the one time he publicly supported it Just happen to coincide with a racist Westbrook burn ?Look at his followers and following. Fake account Then why did he lock it? ?This is the real one 51 following Sorry Gundy He's not following 1,000 like that video everyone is posting You got got Y'all gotta be more pessimistic when evaluating this stuff lol Thats right you guys are smarter than me at evaluating the veracity of stuff That video is fake But I do think his tweets are questionable and hes an ex cop Did anyone say that? He wouldnt say shit like that to a white player period I bet he would say it to Enes Kanter. That doesnt make the tweet real lol Okay but the video being fake doesnt mean the OG tweet was fake either You have to be pretty evil to make shit like that up ?Everyone is trying to dox his employer and now Utah DPS is on damage control for a employee from 6 years ago Lol The internet is cray Lmao twitter is the best The majority of twitter is bullshit but nobody fact checks and so it spreads like wildfire I wasnt there last night so I dont know what really happened but I will say this - Im much more inclined to believe Russ. He has way more to lose so theres really no upside to him bullshitting all of this. And this is going to be a gross generalization, but dudes like that guy typically do behave like jackasses to players. So while most of the tweets are nonsense, I do believe that dude said some shit to Russ that he really shouldnt have Oh 100%. Russ really has no incentive to lie I think the one screenshotted was real but someone created that video to embellish dudes racism But all the misinformation and attempts by people to fit their narrative just cracks me up Lol i def think Russell has a reason to liehe was on camera saying Ill fuck you up and your wifebut Im a hundred percent with you mostly because this guys frankly just seems like the kind of guy that would yell that shit. I also dont see why hed react like that out of nowhere It really is the hat That's a good point space. I guess I'm jumping to the conclusion that I assume Russ wouldn't freak out like that over nothing. Which I think is accurate But he definitely could be embellishing it a bit since he got caught on camera saying that. So he has to justify it Theres also context that this happens to Westbrook more In every arena But all in all I feel like the dude def said some racist shit and Russ is in the right Im going to a thunder game next month. Anything you guys want me to yell at Russ? I mean arent we pretty much in the know about russels version of what he said? Get on your knees like youre used to? I mean that probably warrants his response Yeah he was emasculating him Its also a trend that fans seem like they can say whatever they want at black players without retribution or punishment. And most of all in Utah. I like how Utah fans are getting exposed Nba players didnt just all get together to conspire to make everyone think Utah fans are racist JR Smith says hes never been called the N Word more than in Utah It was her first jazz game give them a break mannn I believe all this! Im just wondering why were arguing about what was said to Westbrook When Westbrook told us what was said to him! I felt this way since watching Celtic Pride I don't wanna speculate and wave the MAGA flame more.. but Westbrook said the guy said "get on your knees like you used to".. which is clearly a slavery reference. And why Russ said it was a "racial comment" Look If it's "get on your knees like you're used to" that's just emasculating but not as bad I think we can all agree That there are fine people on both sides And that we should probably just move on Its a fucked up thing to say in 2019 Well Any year But there are no more excuses Westbrook prob should have left the wife out of it And then no one would care But he was prob trying to emasculate him back? Is toxic masculinity to blame?! Actually! It definitely is! ? Also I think people have been targeted by racism in their lives, have a good sense of whos a racist Without having to hear specific racist language Racists barely use racist language in 2019 too Its all coded Thinly veiled Man everything has to be so goddamn polarizing The guy is obviously a piece of shit Got what he deserved Westbrook should have left his wife out of it Assuming she wasnt screaming at him as well Is there anything else to this? That is what Westbrook alleged last night That the wife also told him to get on his knees Well fuck her too then! Its just a perfect storm of a price of shit heckler meets someone with a notoriously hot temper. Yeah its like that white girl in Oakland yelling at LeBron and calling him a pussy ass bitch during the finals. Luckily for that fan LeBron isnt Westbrook. ? Oh my god I respect the NFL guys doing more ridiculous shit tho Yah for sure! NFL players seem generally pissed that NBA players are more paid, powerful, and famous Good to see them being more crazy lmao The baseball guys are doing it too now lol Like Bryce Harper tampering with mike trout and shit https://twitter.com/lebatard_reddit/status/1105507556909350914?s=12 Lmao, I just heard about the nick foles contract That ridiculous With Lulu? How you gonna slander a mans wife in the JCSL, thats Utah Jazz fan levels of line crossing Lulu has live sports? Lol No pac 12 network so I cant do Hulu live tv Lulu* Pac-12 needs to get on that - that would solve 90% of their problems You guys see the hotel Larry Scott is staying in this week in Vegas? $7,500/night Ya - pretty bad judgement but I guess Im not surprised. Listening to him promote the conference during the womens ship was cringeworthy Lets hope he will be gone by football season lululemon hes their newest endorsement deal Gotta have comfort for that huge hog of his Whelp Jags are going 7-9 Lifetime ban for that fan https://twitter.com/utahjazz/status/1105570407598321664?s=21 Boom!

They should grab Leveon while they're at it Odell and Jarvis kinda nasty combo LSU gang They're boys Didnt leveon go to Michigan State? Or am I completely off base The browns got fleeced Did you see what giants got in return? Please tell us LMAO SMDFTB ODELL ENJOY CLEVELAND 1st and 3rd this year PLUS jabril peppers Who was a first round drafted safety on his rookie contract still Damn that is pretty insane Worth it If he performs Considering what AB went for I think the giants did good, they replaced Collins for way cheaper and they can get the asu receiver in draft plus haskins But I guess if youre Cleveland what value do picks really have at this point? Yeah its def better than the AB deal for the Giants. How old is Odell? Yeah I mean receivers dont win championships, I think its a win for both sides Im just applauding the giants I guess after the Oakland trade I think 27? The giants did good Odell was wasted on that team And they got great value God the browns are gonna be sick Browns had 2 3rd rounders So it dont matter I'm talking bout jarvis and Odell mark Yeah leveon was Michigan st Yep win win IMO Yeah Odell is way younger than AB. He was always gonna demand more. Browns don't want a bunch more 22 year olds anyway Him and Baker are gonna be sick Getting out of a top WR contract is the best thing they did Because paying that to a WR is proven to not be the way to win a SB How badly does this affect Odells Nike contract? He gets a pay cut for going to Cleveland right? Yeah chad youre right though they needed to swing for the fences and ride out bakers rookie contract while they can The Seahawks, eagles, rams formula Nah I dont think this will affect his deal I'd rather pay a top receiver than a top rb ^ true Id rather not pay either ?Didnt realize he has a deescalating deal too I feel like unless youre Tommy you need a legit vertical threat to win tho, even if its not the way to win. Cleveland didnt have that. Who was Seattles? Before Lockett? At least I dont think they did Yah you could go down the line and say any position besides QB you can get by with fill ins. Bottom line your air attack is the most important aspect of your game Kearse? I mean the formula is basically get a great rookie QB and coach then build a defense and let it ride till your QB has to get paid and start over Agreed Dylan Or have a veteran QB who's willing to take 10 mil a year so you can fill out the roster So basically have Tommy lol Yeah. Or any other smart vets Yeah and then you become the Seahawks and hope you can win thru the draft let all your guys go keep the QB and coach and have a culture in place to be a pats type team...in theory Lol yeah gunz or Russell or Big Ben tho or rivers I think you go after Odell if you can get him Hes such a beast when healthy https://www.instagram.com/p/Bu7XWG4FpyL/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=1cpizx8anynwr How many playoff wins does that get you though if youre 20 other teams? Also watch the giants pick end up in Arizona for Rosen Wow they have a fast photoshop team Steelers shoulda traded AB for Rosen Oh interesting chad Start the rebuild baby I think the last thing you want is a head case in a rookie coaches locker room tho Truuuuu I dont understand the nfl salary cap https://twitter.com/jason_otc/status/1105620673907568643?s=21 I dont understand how you can trade someone and then have them still on your cap? Is that cause of guaranteed money? Yeah I think so, I think anything guaranteed you have to eat. Im not positive though. Chad would know hes a sport biz major Yeah Dylan's right. It's all the guaranteed money NY had to pay. There's some rule about spreading that over the first couple years of the deal so you can't just give someone a massive signing bonus then small cap hits in following years Stay woke https://twitter.com/covers_vegas/status/1105628701956272129?s=21 Yes gunz its guaranteed money Thats negotiable in a trade but in this case the giants are paying it They can extent that out too tho it wont be a terrible cap hit Damn that makes me like the deal a lot less for them but theyre gonna suck so who cares Yeah it wont be a big hit I think the Steelers have the largest dead money cap hit in nfl history after the AB trade They also got a 1 and 3 which is awesome The Steelers got absolutely fucked lmao Dude 3 and 1 and peppers is a haul for a non QB You couldnt get that for Todd gurley or Melvin Gordon or really anyone on a non rookie contract https://twitter.com/glennmoorecle/status/1105627993467166721?s=21 Are the Browns gonna get earl thomas??? ?

Yup Classic Pretty good Coke Non-Florida divisin Soso Id say Idk how D2 did it but he supplied the best coke Ive ever had lmao No on metcalf His size is unreal, but route running and spermatozoon Separation lol Probably a great go route runner Removed an exclamation from Probably a great go route runner His speed is crazy for his size But his side to side shit wasnt so great Yup Thats worth a first round pick IMO But maybe I overvalue receivers Someone that can run a route straight is worth a 1st rounder? Would you take will fuller again in 1st round if he was in this draft? https://twitter.com/fieldyates/status/1105649356366065664?s=12 Never gets old I dont know who he is so no Lol Haha Texans WR Fast guy that runs go routes Also whatever spermatazon is I want it I will say his stats sucked but he was on the team with two other nfl receivers Haha that was a great auto correct Its like the amazon for donating sperm Has field yates never seen that meme lol Wow Doncic is pulling a LeBron. 1-9 at the line tonight Dallas gotta rest Luka and put the tank into high gear Gonzaga 4 min from missing tourney Why does Nurk keep wearing yellow shoes all the sudden Diego montayo game for Seth curry Dehaan no I wouldnt I take nuk obvi lol You wouldnt what? I think he means taking will fuller Draft fuller in the first ?First round war! Leveon to jets lolololol Jets over under 6 wins Lol oh boy. Bad move for him. LT 2.0 Yupp I dont get why a team would ever pay that kind of money for a RB Nowadays Lifes a Gamble! Thankful I dont have to listen to the mixtape ?Oliver Maroney with a rich father (Howard Schultz of Starbucks) Damn dame ain't gonna pass LA in LA Smh but good fucking win! Still got a good shot at 50 wins too CJ showcasing himself for that summer trade too. I love it When we get Anthony Davis for CJ>>>> I still believe we can outbid the Lakers And LaMarcus coming home to play alongside AD? Wow When is LAs contract up? Like when realistically could he come back 2021 as a free agent but we could trade for him Trade Meyers for him All the 2016 guys are expiring This summer You think spurs would want to get rid of him for an expiring?? And if they like Collins Or Simons And a pick or two Sidebar: Has Mason Plumlee gotten his triple double yet? If you dont have to give up CJ the deal is a win for Portland Pop would have to retire for them to do that Is that not possible??? CJ for AD tho let's make it happen He clearly hates his job now Could happen! Too bad LA signed that contract extension with them! ? https://twitter.com/netw3rk/status/826650874390929409?s=21 ^ if were pulling up 2017 tweets Fuck lamarcus And AD RUN IT BACK NIEL We'll channel some 2011 Mavs vibes with Dame in his downward prime and a bunch of old wiley fucks Your right Dylan! I kinda hope we extend ET and Meyers I need Neil to extend Meyers I really do If Meyers logs more seasons as a blazer than terry porter I'm turning in my fan card Retire that number 11 Kids will look back in 20 years like damn who was that legend Meyers Leonard? 15 seasons with Portland? He must have been a beast! Dude chad this has always been my blazers pipe dream We get the right cast around Dame when hes just unquestionably the best guard in the west For 1 year Chauncey billups type shit When Steph and Harden have a slight decline and Dame is in that sweet spot is what we need Gunz I think we can speak that into reality We just need our Rasheed Wallace mid season trade Who's gonna be that X factor LaMarcus baby Lol this is peak delusional blazer talk God you're getting me horny Lol Space must be having a hell of a time This is how we convince ourselves to watch another season Dylan There's always a chance! We do this 11 times a year Dude what if LaMarcus does some Anthony Davis shit Fool me once shame on me guys I know olshey #RunItBack And is just like no Im not playing and I want out Whats the market for LaMarcus on the trade market Realistically Who has the incentive to trade for him? Space can suck my dick cuz that heat team is hot garbage Other than US "Guys James Johnson is really turning the corner!" "Olynyk is an underrated finisher at the rim!" Collins, Simons and two firsts Boom And salary filler Idk if LA has the balls to go that hard at a trade request Probably not so who else? We have 50 million in expirings Or at least close to it Blake could be available I'm cooling a bit on the Kevin Love idea Blake would be epic I wouldnt include CJ for love Hell no He wouldn't require CJ If the Cavs want a first and cap relief tho Cavs fans are drooling over that scenario They would take Just expiring Like thats the goal for Cavs fans is trade love for CJ Jimmy S&T Depends how much and how long https://twitter.com/adamschefter/status/1105864566473396225?s=21 https://chipotlerewardme.com/#/ Man It all worked out for earl Drop in your phone number on that site and chipotle might Venmo you for a burrito I put in my phone number but all I got was E. coli https://twitter.com/denverpost/status/1105806692682551296?s=21 If you guys don't hear from me tomorrow, the bomb cyclone got me Holy shit thats fucking wild Good thing I got my Nike duck boots lol The official shoe of the Superliga Spuds like another day in fever Denver You might as well correct spuds while ur at it. Instagram / Facebook down ? #cowx My IG appears to be working For now https://twitter.com/complex/status/1105873012979625985?s=21 Snapchat is alive and kicking boys! is myspace working? I'm now getting thunder and snow. Don't get that combo too often Sounds like an imagine dragons song Imagine Dragons ft Fever Spuds I heard that Imagine Dragons & Fever Spuds are doing the SBLIV halftime show next year ?Looking pretty warm out there U miss the bay? Oh ferk ?Not at all actually. This was red rocks last weekend. I love it out here That looks awesome Red rocks is near the top of my bucket list We missed chromeo and Rufus there last year! Will likely regret that for awhile Yeah that wouldve been so good Snoop dogg is playing red rocks on 4/20 this year But seriously if anyone wants to hit red rocks this summer you got a free place to stay I wish I could heart that 100 times JCSL Reunion: Denver Oh baby. It is v centrally located The Gang Goes Mile High Denver live out! Rum Ham at altitude will fuck you up ?? ?? ?? Hahaha Did Jussie Smolletts ingenious plan include getting indicted for 16 felonies? Rum Ham is objectively one of the greatest episodes in television history. https://www.redrocksonline.com/events/detail/10360 Anderson Paak June 14? Ducks 4-1 to win the pac 12 247 Sports predicted Ducks over Beavs in the championship lol Would be fucking classic ? Damn New Orleans is breaking up the Ingram/Kamara duo Is Latavius Murray good? No What a dumb move by them For real. That was a fucking beastly duo Cut that meat ! Peyton Manning honestly the commercial GOAT Yeah he and Blake griffin have natural acting ability I cant remember a single commercial he was in that I didnt like All big RBs like that are the same Ingram = latavious Ahhh, I thought Ingram was better but thats probably Saints colored glasses ? Russ Hanneman? Ingram is way better than Latavius imo The difference is small enough to take the cheaper guy every time Truuuu https://twitter.com/bball_ref/status/1105907713018642438?s=21 I saw that Dame is a 96 on 2K now Jesus Christ for real? That's big time His passing has improved a ton this year They just dropped some Dame pack and he posted it with a 96 rating Good stat but definitely falls in that annoyingly specific stat zone for me 25/5 is a pretty round number benchmark tho It's like 20/10 for a big man Yeah I guess it's the 4 or more times in first 7 seasons part They left off the fact that he's averaging the most assists in nba history on Tuesday night road games. Big if true Would prefer to see how his average pts / assists average stack up historically Average average Yeah that's totally fair. The 4 in 7 is kinda cherry picked Dame always rates out in the fastest to counting stats tho Guys arent that consistent from year 1 in the league to year 7 the way he has He was #BornReady Or get the keys to the offense from your first season Dame is the real #BornReady Dame needs to be the first player to lead us to WCF since 99-00 Houman that's the smartest thing you've ever said We have to squad this year to do so... barring any injuries Holy shit Houmie believes in the blazers I truthfully never thought Id see the day I BELIEVE! I do not believe in stotts I dont believe in his ability to adjust but lets pray that in this hypothetical world we dont need adjustments until WCF Murray=ingram Very similar Both in between the tackle runners. I don't believe in stotts either unfortunately. Guy makes zero adjustments when things go wrong The first time he lets a 16-0 run rattle off without calling a timeout im going to break my tv Stats show timeouts dont stop runs Just sayin Gundy thats your buy theyre dissing! Boy* Im gonna run and text terry right now Is that true? No absolutely not Helps you get a bucket on your next possession but doesnt stop a lead build or loss in aggregate other than that Brock I remember this argument vividly lol. That you don't believe in momentum in sports Show me the stats cuz I beg to differ Well I would argue the presence of something should be proven versus the absence But for arguement a sake https://scholarship.tricolib.brynmawr.edu/bitstream/handle/10066/6918/2011PermuttS_thesis.pdf?sequence=2 Ok so all Im reading is the conclusion bc I can only care so much But he seems to flatly acknowledge That other studies have drawn different conclusions. Also, making adjustments seems to at least be proven to be beneficial on offense I dunno why that couldnt be the case with d My main point. If you say something is effective You have to prove it Not the other way around Everyone out here making statements about timeout when theres no evidence they help long term game odds I know but to buy that its this is true across the board Id like to see this study but only amongst the best teams Me too I'm gonna sound real get off my lawn here, but I don't think momentum and the hot hand can accurately be quantified The hot hand is most definitely real They had a paper that confirmed it at Sloan last year Or two years ago Im also a little confused by the the difference between increased short term performance and momentum That said the hot hand is in fact a thing Idk about momentum Yah the trick with studying the hot hand is a good definition that mirrors what everyone feels when they know its going o. The hot hand is just something you can feel when youre playing When youre confident in your shot You shoot more effortlessly I also agree with chad that their are forces that exist in sports that are tough to quantify Sure but that makes it hard to prove statistically Probably true but that makes them dangerous cause theyre just as many that arent real that are assumed true Look at the raptors the last few years lol Like you have to establish the run Theyve been statistically dominant Dont shoot 3 pointers But everyone knew they would choke and they always did Brock if Ive learned anything from being on Twitter its that I can say whatever wild shit I want and its up to you to prove me wrong. I dont have to be right. I didn't realize how close the west got. Houston could grab the 1 seed ?And Denver has murderers row the last 10 games I know Houmans only doing one bracket but for everyone else, could you please sign up for my bracket? http://ow.ly/1CNJ50n4YuL Ill be heading back to Florida this summer to make sure the money goes to good use ?Dubov you should apply! Fuck just got my airplane WiFi working, read through 124 texts arguing about momentum and hot hand and cant google a shotty article written by some college freshman to prove they both are a thing. Im gonna DM ML Brand a picture of my asshole. Hopefully they pick me! Self taken or are you gonna enlist Ash to help make sure you get the right angle to really make your sphincter sing? Selfie for sure More deliberate that way. Dont want them accidentally mistaking the photo for a head shot. TEVIN COLEMAN TO THE NINERS LETS GO That backfield will be a fantasy nightmare Nice pickup I think theyre gonna cut McKinnon Matt Breida is dope And somehow not white RIP Blake Bortles Gunned down in his prime No one played better down 28 ? Brock you just inspired me to gamble Golden State +145 tonight The hot hand! Thats like a band name Is one of the worst jokes But The hot hand Is actually a cool band name https://twitter.com/cosmis/status/1105996445663064066?s=21 Cute streak Detroit! ? You know how they say like 90% of car accidents happen within 2 miles of your house 90% of the time I shart it's within 500 feet of my apartment Just taking unnecessary risks Assuming yall watched student athlete on hbo? I need to still How is it Im diving in face first right now Just started Ill report back 2 more hours on this flight gotta fill the time NBA playoffs begin a month from today What if series is jazz thunder and the banned jazz fan goes to all the away games Lmao that would be amazing if he has any money leftover after suing Westbrook Dwyane Wades last reg season game Is in Brooklyn I know its Wassu, but what Dana has done with this team is absolutely absurd Whats the score? Ducks by 20 currently early in the second half 40-20 Weeeeee Damn Wazzu with 20. Ferk. Ducks held 3 of last 4 teams to season lows in pts, about to do it again to Wassu Will be 4 of 5 Gotta love that Nick Richards do anything at Kentucky? Student Athlete is a meh in my book. Nothing groundbreaking just reaffirming what everyone already knows. Student athlete isnt that good Wish I had seen your text earlier. Wouldve saved you the time. God dammit Oh well had nothing better to do Jesus now Beto is in I think we need to institute a one in, one out policy for the Democratic primary Beto's gonna bring it home I bet you at least 5 more democrats announce haha Rmr when trump got elected and ppl thought it was the end of the world ???? https://twitter.com/caitiedelaney/status/1105521970060259328?s=20 I saw that lol Houman you are MAGA?

Oof When are people gonna realize how fucking bad sports proposals are Unfortunately never Theyre only good when she says no They are all doomed Penn State gonna beat Minnesota today. What happens to Minnesota then, Rengel? They better be out We are only one spot behind them in NET but no one will give us time of day I dont blame them You havent watched a game all yr stfu Yea wait ducks making the tourney or what I mean were gonna win the pac 13 But other than that We are only allowing 50 points a game in our last 5 pretty good D Unfortunately winning the tourney is our only way in I think Ducks have to win the tourney unfortauntely, even tho if they go to the ship in the PAC 12 and lose their net ranking may be in the 40s As was the case with RPI, its just a factor, not everything Houman are you gonna go to the NIT championship to cheer on the Ducks? Depending on tix I dont want Houman jumping on the bandwagon now I do want to go to msg at some point Some of us have been here all year Aka just Rengel and myself I hope Jimmy D gives you the ban hammer at MSG Dont forget Dubov Nah I cant claim to be a real duck fan this year Womens team, sure. But Ive maybe watched 3 ducks games which is very unlike me Lets get the elite 8 tix. Theyll be in Portland for sure Fuck yeah Im in for that Actually, Ive watched a few more than I thought. Iowa, Syracuse, TX Southern, Houston, OSU, Zona, UW, and UW again. And last night.

Sidebar: ESPN is making a massive push with UFC stuff, interested to see how it plays out over the next 5 years The early announcement for ACC network programming sucks lmao The fuck is ESPN doing SEC network works because theyre all Deep South rednecks ACC network is gonna simultaneous market to southern rednecks, mid-atlantic elites, and New England elites Wowowow guys major sports media tea Actually not major Just something this group chat would be interested in Apparently the Big 3 doesnt pay Oliver Maroney to be the Big 3 guy They pay for travel and nothing else Lifestyles of the bitch and famous Sorry, sorry. Rich and famous. My bad. About to get that job You should fight Maroney for it Idk I think hed win Hahaha Maroney is a world class phony Fake news maroney is the enemy of the American people Hes not good chad, but dont be surprised if he ends up good This is true Brock Whos Ja Moran, should I care about him Yes he's really good Hes getting lots of Dame comparisons Like a Westbrook type guy? Athletic af pg from Murray state High flyer Lock top 3 pick right now But can assist and shoot Number 2 pick will be him or RJ Barrett Had a school ever had people go 1-2? Kentucky AD and MKG Yikes Connecticut had 2 #1s in a year Omeka Okafor and Diana Taurasi Thats pretty baller Wait Emeka was #2 behind Dwight When Ionescu and Bol Bol each go #1>>>> Yeah and Ben Gordon went 3 There's actually a lot of schools that get 2 of top 3 which is pretty nuts I think Kansas has Wiggins and Embiid. Which woulda been 1-2 if he wasn't hurt Jim Calhoun back at it low key Coaching D III He kill someone? Jesus God this just reminded me of the time the Baylor head basketball basketball coach actually covered up a murder Any hot takes for first round upsets? Reading a ringer article Love the slow play + bombing 3s math argument Northeastern and New Mexico State Brock - can you explain the ducks current run without using the word momentum? Uh they found a successful defensive play style and are executing it? Im kinda kidding. I was listening to a Pac-12 podcast and were only using the word momentum. You are correct Dont trigger me Sorrrrry I just spent 15 bucks on a March Madness E-Book, you guys better watch out Is the pac 12 podcast the shittiest power 5 podcast? $15 < $2000 $15 = 1.5 Houman brackets They actually have a dope intro rap . Look up mike yam Or 3 foot longs next month!!! I think Spencer invited me to play b-ball at a park without b-ball court Spencer is like one of the few guys I could never get upset with for that I dont care. I just hope its not like Happy Gilmore Just listen to the intro - its par with Dame Dolla https://twitter.com/mike_yam/status/1108149653026025474?s=12 ?Guys feel free to use this when ur bracket gets busted day one Zygi Wilf went to Fairleigh Dickinson. Mr. T and DJ Premier attended Prairie View A&M but did not graduate. (I hope you guys are ready for notable alumni and fun facts for every school that plays in this tournament over the next four days) This next matchup is a really juicy battle of alumni. Belmont University of Nashville, TN vs. Temple University of Philadelphia, PA> Lets start with Belmont. Sco Belmont I threw a 10 spot on Belmont just to give me something to care about Damon Hininger and R. Milton Johnson. CEOs of the Corrections Corporation of America and the Hospital Corporation of America. For-profit prisons and healthcare facilities, respectively. Brad Paisley, Lee Ann Womack, Trisha Yearwood, Josh Turner, Greg Bates, and BOTH halves of Florida Georgia Line Plus a shit ton more country artists. Now for temple. And boy let me tell you, their alumni list is PROBLEMATIC. Dr. Huxtable himself, Bill Cosby. Fellow alleged sexual deviant Diplo ? That potty mouth Bob Saget. Noted racist Irving Berlin. Ted Bundy double dipping in this category as he did attend Temple for a semester. Wow so betting on temple is basically betting on the huskies And the Scranton Strangler himself - Toby Flenderson https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ucla-admissions-soccer-recruit-20190319-story.html Also Jimmy Pop from The Bloodhound Gang lmao Hall & Oates, Noam Chomsky, Adam McKay, Paul F. Tompkins, and Steve Javie also on the list for Temple. Whoops didn't realize we were doing a thing haha disregard my message Oh Im done lol ?

Bernie Sanders ? Troy Brown hands down Anyone want to go to the game tonight? 15 dolla Where are the tickets I was trying to take my little brother tonight but I could only find SRO What famous alumni are playing each other ? Former Mavs assistant Terry Stotts vs. former Barrel Room legend Mark Cuban Oh its an NBA game lol Guys I have a great feeling about Oregon. Last time we were a 12 seed in San Jose we beat the #5 and #4 to go to the sweet 16. Ya youre right Dubov. Never mind Ya buddy Gundy. A lot of similarities between the teams for sure Plus KSUs best player is out if we get them next Sorry I thought Gundy said that haha It's okay rengel making mistakes is human. We all do it. It me rengel That being said I dont want to hear anybody but Clayton praising the ducks when we knock off duke for the chip Oh yeah Im not gonna be claiming that credit Only for the women If you dont love them at 15-12 then dont love them at 29-12 This is going to sound like a bandwagon statement but I actually really do like the way theyre playing now a lot better than the rest of the season but thats because I place tremendous value on defense If they played defense like this st the start of the season I would have been on board Theyd also be a 5 seed.. but whats the difference now I place tremendous value on winning eight games in a row But definitely they flipped a switch and bought into everything they are doing now Direct result of the defense I know I care more than most but I would put this high on my list as accomplishments for the teams I follow I dont disagree with that. I left them for dead back in January. I tried but couldnt haha. They suckered me back by blowing out asu Guys all I'm saying is Oregon is gonna have a hell of a tournament run, but also don't be surprised if they don't Ill own up if they lose Friday. Not like its gonna be an easy game either way. The ncaa gifted them this bracket tho so u gotta feel good. Ncaa wins when the ducks win Table 1 is Houman https://twitter.com/jasondondean/status/1108412062504570880?s=12 https://m.imdb.com/title/tt1302006/?ref_=m_tt_mv_close Deniro pesci Pacino wow Yes You see the Tarantino trailer No I got it shared but been reluctant to reshare content given recent incidents Related - I found the origin of that DeAngelo copy pasta it's on r / NBA with like 250 upvotes right now No one noticed !!!

2nd (20%): 80
3rd (10%): 40 Lol I was just looking at my transcript For the first time in ages Loving this start from my LSU tigers I did not apply myself my senior year! Love a good team with a scandal that led to a coach firing He aint fired yet! Hes just away from the team right? Its too bad cuz LSU is pretty sick Yeah hes on leave. He refuses to acknowledge any wrong doing so the university wont allow him to be with the team until it gets resolved. LSU is the best team in the SEC You gonna say that when Tennessee is cutting down the nets? Brought back a lot of memories of skipping all my classes to sit on the couch at BPP I wonder if I even went to half of my classes senior year They literally won the conference being the best team in the NCAA tournament is not the same thing I know I like them but I think once they get to the sweet 16 the distraction will be too big Oh I agree. I have them exiting in the round of 32. But a single elimination tournament isnt necessarily an indicator of who the best team is. just who is hot right now. For sure Chess is really difficult, I heard. - Chuck Tramont Waters is so nice Gundy why do all the blazers players wear distressed jeans Because theyre nerds Idk Dame is very into true religion So the team follows suit Its my least favorite quality about dame Its also the only thing he and Farbod have in common ? Im hedging my Auburn Sweet 16 pick with New Mexico State moneyline I was worried about Auburn even tho I really like them Bruce Pearl is gonna choke it away Would u guys want the 1 & 1 in the nba? It would make the end of games way more fun But also result in a lot of intentional fouls Elam ending is coming They should make it so you get one free throw and if you make it you can choose to risk it double or nothing on a second free throw Thats bold 4 pt line please and thank you Here comes Louisville Dubov, apologize to the gophers now Fuck no Theyre still trash Looking for that back ?? cover with my bulldogs Jimmer to the sun's yes His TBT team takes a hit too!

I do not University of VIRGINIA Wow I guess thats it then. Virginia is cancelled. Seated at spirit By pop a shot In the back row Houman keeps the hot hand Buffalo-ASU is a stayaway Nah hammer the devils Buffalo is lit dude Mark and I both in 2nd in the big boy group No way Im not In last is all I can say Lmao the guy in 1st place in Rengel's group didn't fill out a Champion. So he's only got 156 possible points left I need Colgate to come through It can get me back in it I just need a few of these upsets to hit Also Georgia state over Houston I saw that Chad I was so confused Jesus Christ gundy You just went for anarchy Kept looking through the regions I'm like "he only has one wrong pick I don't get it" Dude the tourney is that a lot
Of times And the matchup for Colgate was good Per my 15 dollar March Madness e book Also Georgia State 5-out offense Is gonna give houston problems I don't see Colgate winning they're not really fans of plaque Colgate needs to calmate ?? They're really driving at the teeth of the Tennessee defense 4 out of 5 pundits agree Colgate is good for your brackets Colgate came through with the cover at least Guys, Ducks Pey Pey Heck ya! Anyone famous Oregon alumni ? Yo Mark wut u doing next weekend? How dare they cut away from basketball to tell me that some nerd submitted a report to his boss Im around I believe Maybe Seattle? No man Mark did we push on our two bets? Yea You covered the under NYC Me you and Gundy Lmao Next week ?? Fucking lmao ?? (matt Cox and cam were at the same restaurant in Tokyo at exact same time) (I don't believe they planned this) The cam smith Matt cox conspiracy Only one fucked a robot It's crazy because unless I saw this story I never would have known can was going to Japan ?????? lol wait the guy that forgot to pick a winner in Bunkys pool is Glenn Meehan ?? Hes like 70 years old Used to be the coordinator for Beaverton youth basketball Hahahahaha shut up Ducks So much time left Can someone tell me how the game is going Im just watching on gamecast Cant gauge the momentum/emotions Louie the king and Kenny Wooten making big Plays We are grinding Wisconsin out Yeah we are already in the bonus and Wisconsin has 11 turnovers Im happy with the trajectory here Pretty much have to stay engaged on d and aggressive on o? Trust the process Dana > Stotts Dana is a top 5 coach in CBB Ive said it for 3 years and Im sorry try arguing what hes doing Glad we locked him for a few more years ? This is beyond impressive Trump definitely didnt tweet that. That said, theres a good chance he did tweet that. - Maroney, probably. ? Time to put those duck winnings to work Miss st $10 please Is UC Irvine good? ? Damnit https://twitter.com/ramonashelburne/status/1109229920389984256?s=21 Big Embezzlement Brand Holy shit I just read that whole story haha. Lavar is as dumb as well thought "I trust too much" ? Duke gonna lose ?Lavar got this email from their financial advisor in October. What was his response? Fired the financial advisor, then apparently did read the entire email until a couple weeks ago because a reporter asked Lonzo if they knew their business partner served 7 years in prison for running a Lonzo scheme. Lonzo had no idea lmao Ponzi scheme** I think if I got an email that said "urgent $1.5 million dollars missing".. I would read the email Maybe it went to spam That guy is a major character in Ball in the familys He served 7 years in jail for financial fraud and money laundering!! How dumb can they be haha They might as well hire Billy McFarland to be their CFO My Lakers buddy "the Nike route probably would have been easier" Im about to do a meme on this Picture of Billy MacFarland + upgrade button + picture of that guy? Reverse ? Yassss Gundy Dude they're already using Foster as a cop out. Lavar said it was fosters idea to make their own shoe and not sign with Nike Fucking idiots Its time for you to stand your ground on Lavar great father/humanitarian takes ? ? Alright I'm done Lavar did help get the G league to institute a higher pay scale But he cost Lonzo money Both things can be true Cant blame him for Gelo And yall watch LaMelo is gonna be in the league You cant blame him for Gelo? He didnt rob a fucking store in China And hes also not built for school Gelo is a townie in the true sense of the word. Haha gundy don't make excuses. He's not built for school? Matt those both have me dying ???? Idk dude just watching him on the show I can't wait for the American Greed episode He just doesnt have it Its completely on the couch analysis Idk that just seems lazy. What is he built for then? Doing nothing like he is now? Seems like bad fathering to me tbh True Feels like he could have had a nice collegiate career at UCLA Maybe, maybe not but hes gone on the record that he didnt want to go to school Like hes the guy who loves hoop more than anyone but hes just not that good. I wish he could be like the family lawyer or some shit But he clearly doesnt want to do that Well I don't want to work but I need to make money. Sounds like he's just lazy af lol Okay but not everyone is the same idk Im just saying how I see it Idk man. I've been with Ian on the Lavar is ruining his children and this is gonna end badly train Melo is gonna make it Gelo will be fine Bro Like Melo has offers from Duke and Kentucky. LaMelo is already 65 You gotta quit this one Hes only 17 He could keep growing You are blinded by your hatred for LaVars methods that you cant see how good LaMelo Is Thats my favorite thing about the Ball fam Thinks Sean Livingston, before the injury + 3pt ability The complete inability for people to assess the kids as players because of their father Everyone gets a brain cramp cause of Lavar Well so far they've all sucked D Lo > Lonzo Check Zos plus minus And their defensive stats He just got hurt Bro DLo is better right now but Lonzo will be better Im not making up the numbers Their defense was top 5 when he was healthy and bottom 5 when he got hurt ? Last three games. Wheres my love for the billikins I do like his defense but what's he doing outside of that. Will you at least agree his shooting prowess was a farce? Also 76 ??s He shot good from 3 in college for one season and everyone thought he was the second coming of steph Ignoring his poor FT% which is often indicative of overall shooting ability I respect Tacko ?Tacko Cam Juarez Fall https://twitter.com/betmybookie/status/1108028904575561728?s=21 Lol Can I get ?? -1?

Jesus terry my guy That was horrendous What the fuck was that Oh my god That was like the prevent defense in football Why the fuck was dame dancing in the backcourt That was on Dame Totally. Horrible. As soon as he took that nonchalant turn with the ball I knew the play was doomed He panicked when he saw the double team coming and lost the ball Put your fucking head down and drive the ball Why is he catching at the other free throw line Ridiculous Can we please just ride Nurk in 2OT Ed fouled out and JA cant stick him JA is out too ain't he? Oh maybe Yeah centers all fouled out Ride the beast! Even more reason to feed my man Yo wtf Nurk always getting clocked lol He lives in the mix Lol can this fan shut the fuck up? Dude for real Hes a fucking moron At least it wasnt racist! lmao that steal from mo was hilarious This game is a shining example of why the season should be 62 games Nurk done Oh fuck Fuck Fuck fuck fuck Oh fuck fuck fuck Fuck fuck fuck Dude holy shit Wtf Broke his leg Whyyyyyyy Fun season You gotta be kidding Why basketball gods!!!! Wes part 2 Omg What happened Im gonna be sick Broke leg bad Like wrong way Cj not coming back this season either now Was that Hayward level bad? Theyre not gonna show the replay huh ?

Oh guys Its really bad live https://twitter.com/large_professor/status/1110404097092526080?s=21 Oof ? 2-6 weeks Im sorry did the refs just stop reffing after that delay? He had 32/16/5 too Russell is murdering Seth Whyyyyyyyyyyy 32/16/5/KevinWare Seriously though, were out in the first round right? Or does Z-Easy take over? We already were DID WE ALL JUST BECOME MEYERS BELIEVERS!!! But now for sure Seriously can you stop with the Kevin Ware shit Weird the nets fouled there? ? Im not kidding Stop Why are they fouling? Why would house of highlights post it Omar no ?Me watching Mark keep going with more Ware Guys guys guys Dubov said stop twice Listen mark youre Wareing on me Damn I was about ready to book my flight to Temecula https://twitter.com/pinwheelempire/status/1110404856525680640?s=21 I've never felt anything like that tweet Im trying to eat dinner out of my favorite tupperWARE ? Fuck you both Paul George came back and is doing really well Youth on nurks side Thank you! Paul George is an MVP candidate Nurk will be fine Im asking you to stop and youre gonna keep being jackasses? Can we go back and give Brooklyn the win in regular time or 1st OT? Im done, Im going to bed God what a fuck Nurk will be fine look at Kevin Wa...oh shit sorry Dubov How about dudleys arm hugging his back there? was that ankle or leg ? Which one is worse? It looked like lower leg Nurks looks just like PG's Shin area Idk Hayward was ankle Injury tearing the group text apart Didn't see that coming Oh no Did I miss something? Are Ware and Dubov related? Don't know am curious what set him off Yes please tell me I saw him getting butt hurt so I just stoked the flame I think its was when jusuf Nurk KC snapped his leg in half Jesus that was brutal So... is it cool to come back inside now? No but like why did he get so mad about the ware references specifically Yes exactly the Kevin ware references set him off He had some deadstock KW 1s hes been trying to offload since 2013 ?? Well glad I picked this as my one Portland game to watch this year This is unreal So we're not gonna get Nurk back til 2020-2021 So fucking depressing dude Nurk was the key in the playoffs Fuck Gives Zach time to develop Nurk about to come back when his contract will be expiring Meyers time!!!! You guys think its the Avenatti thing? Yeah this has gotta be like 18 months minimum Especially with his size and weight The hippy that works across me says mercury is in retrograde He got so much better this year Yes, but hopefully this doesnt just mind fuck Nurk. Not many come back like PG Lol I dont support you guys being meanbut if you renamed the group to the Kevin ware superliga and invited Dubov back in I would be very curious to see what happened! But dont! I thought sig ep meant brothers for life House of highlights took down the video thank God Bad move on their part Yeah thats insane! Ill text Dubov tomorrow, its my fault You know how many little kids they just scarred So twitter doctors are telling me he may never come back Where's Houman when you need him I mean I feel like thats always a risk with an injury like that Especially for a big guy Actually I blame clay on this one! Wait is this for real? Yes Sadly Don't watch it Yeah I feel like I'm just gonna have to accept that nurkic is never gonna play for us again And hope for the best Apparently dont listen to it either I feel like its my fault too but Im not great at calling out when im in the wrong so Im going to keep playing dumb Yes I think hes done as a blazer He has 3 years left on his contract come on guys Well at least hell still get his 50 million Broy part 2 Positive thing: a break is better than chronically bad knees! Idk man I just don't wanna get my hopes up That's a lot of weight on that leg Look how long Livingston took to come back That wasnt Livingston bad but it was bad Thank god he was wearing leggings Or else his bone woulda popped out Well Congrats on the playoff clinch! I legit felt with the right matchups we could have made the WCF this year And fuck you ian before you call me a homer I somehow knew this would be taken out on me! ? Watch us win a playoff series on pure will That'd be a very dame story line God dammit fuck you space This is your fault I mean Lange could step it up Hes a liability on defense You have to WARE this for the rest of your life Ian Tho Youre a liability in this group chat! I dont need this energy going into tomorrows game against the magic First hit of weed after finishing my game story thought: its time to bring LaMarcus home If pop retires after the season I think we could get him for very little Also dame started talking about nurkic coming over to see Dame Jr after practice just because and I nearly cried in the locker room ? This reminds me of the year we were 2/3 seed with Wesley and he got injured High hopes Just woke up to 226 messages..welp ?? Stay woke https://twitter.com/yahoosportsnba/status/1110548103113986048?s=21 Thabo rocked the air maxs last night Air max day lets goooooo Man for a minute I thought that was a Sonics jersey Me too So is terry gonna start Zach and give him 30 minutes a night? Time to see what he can do Yeah probably start Zach and go small with the second unit Play more Layman The Large Russian is returning shortly! I told him were discussing potential 2nd units, he couldnt resist ? Chad I hear you have some spicy takes on the second unit He said throw anfernee in the deep end sink or swim moment I mean, he cant be worse than Aminu, right? Kanter is gonna get more mins and ZC. More Layman and Simons, less Aminu and Harkless. Honestly I dont watch the blazers much More Hood But Kanter is totally serviceable Theyre gonna have to switch up the way they play And youre gonna get a deep look into the mind of terry stotts The rotation should be Dame, CJ (if/when hes back), Layman, ZC, Curry, Hood, and Harkless probably. And thats it If we get CJ back we have a chance to win a series if we get the clippers maybe If its more than 7 guys we arent winning any playoff games Yeah I mean Kanter will be the 8th guy in the regular season Less whites, thats my vote ?? Sorry, forgot Kanter. Drop harkless. But once the playoffs start, I could see 7 man rotation Harkless is playing his best ball of the year Aminu is shooting 85% from the stripe but only taking 2 attempts per game. The fuck is that? Did I have a spicy take? 30 minutes to Z-Easy? Thatd be dope I mean I hope he gets close to that. No reason not to Dont we have some guy named Skal? Lets get him in the mix That dudes trash Don't waste minutes on him Skal baby! Haitian Nurk! My guy jessie is INNOCENT Hahahaha Lmao charges dropped, looks like hell be heading back to show biz more famous than ever, all according to plan Lolol bro he cut a deal, hes gonna have to come out and say something Is he gonna take a deal and then stick with his story? https://twitter.com/carminesabia/status/1110565943162347521?s=12 Lol god what a take yah yikes ?? Dude theres no deal I dont think This shit isnt going to trial lmao The Chicago police is, unfortunately, not very trustworthy Yeah he already spoke on camera professing his innocence What about the Milwaukee police force? Judge must be a huge Empire fan They said they aren't charging him cuz he already did community service Wait wait wait His name is Jussie?! ^ this took me awhile as well This entire time I thought people were just misspelling Jessie Its pronounced juicy also What the fuck Throw him in jail forever It was all a Dream.. Lol Gundy you have no idea, all you have is a statement from his lawyer In fact the only thing we know is that it isnt going to trial And well yes Or Mitch McConnel in Ians case Chicago pd is a sketchy as sketchy gets Video tapes And interviews from the people he paid to stage this buying all of the things used in the attack arent Hes not going to prison bc he doesnt deserve prison time for a first time non violent offense And the DA is not a sociopath Not bc all of a sudden his story holds up He did community service and forfeited his 10,000 dollar bond the show must go on! Get this man a leading role Lol whats frustrating about your take Brock is that it will take at least 5 years to prove or disprove ?? Celebrity big brother doesnt count Hahaha Damn it That was my backup no joke What you have against celebrity big brother Ian. That is the only good reality show Early surreal life Wow we really gonna pretend like Very Cavalari isnt the best how on television? Bro I miss jay cutler too My bovada bonus $100 just hit the account from a referral. Whats the hammer play boys! Lol speaking of hoaxes The suns sure are committed to this devin booker scam Devon? Nah had it right the first time No nerve or muscle damage !! I really hate to see this mark But magic +5.5 isnt a horrible bet They always play the heat well Have been on fire Desperately need this game And have a decent cushion spread wise However Throw that shit on father prime! Yea not doing that Ill take you for $50 though Magic +5.5 Hahahaha Oh man I might hit that just to make a night out of it But the line dropped Youre gonna do it so stop the mewling and say yes Yeah but the line did actually drop a full point 4.5 or you wanna dance with the ML of +165 Lets just do 4.5 ML is confusing I need to think about it Devin booker is a fraud I'm with you space How can you say that with certainty The whole put him back in the game down 30 to get a 60 piece is fraudulent Hes good But the milestone chasing is a fucking joke Hes only been in one extremely shitty situation And hes 22 years old He aint a fraud in fanttasssyyyy I can say whatever I want with certainty Doesn't make it true But I'm sure certain ? Booker is an amazing scorer for sure But nah I actually am in the camp that his stats are overinflated and he doesn't contribute to winning And his playmaking has improved this year as well Yeah Gundy thats actually what I was referring to But I also kind of agree with chad If he's that good, him and Ayton should get more wins than they have This week playing for the Superliga title will be the most manful ball of his career tho Meaningful * Hes not good unless hes ball dominant and no team built around him will ever be good He has improved in almost every statistical category every season hes been in the league Yeah I mean the Suns are in a historically bad run right now I dont think thats his fault Yeah that's exactly the point Dubov. His stats are great but what has it done for them lol Is he also the GM and I didnt know it? They have way more talent than 17 wins Do they? I dunno I just dont see where he fits into the league Like obviously hes talented Lou Williams Heavy Do you really think they have more talent than the Mavs, Grizzlies, Pelicans, Lakers, Wolves, and Kings? Those are the non-playoff teams ahead of them Mavs yes grizzlies debatable I'm not saying they're a playoff team but if Booker is so special and Ayton is really good. They should be better than historically bad Their team just has a major design flaw; they dont have a point guard Theyre talented but ill equipped to function as a unit imo Look Dubov I think Booker is great, just don't be surprised if he's also bad Wow balance take chad You guys could learn a lot from chads measured demeanor Space you want this bet Chad Maroney! Hey mark You need to take a step back Let life come to you! Space that was a maroney reference if you missed it Hey Ian, your being exposed as a bandwagon fan Cant wait to see you in the Knicks jersey next year I no longer make lukewarm takes after you roasted me for the Lavar ball thing I didnt miss it! Man Come on! Did you guys hear they may fold big baller brand altogether? All Im saying is hes playing at a high level on a shitty team and we cant truly make a judgement until hes in a different situation If he goes to the pacers someday and they just fucking tank then yeah Did Lonzo sign with Nike? Seems that way but idk for sure He signed with Michael Avenatti Michael Avenatti sounds like he could be the leader of one of the five families with that name Who else is ready for BUZZ CITY to smack around the Spurs tonight Hammer play? Wait why is Charlotte 3 point dogs? No kemba? No batum Anybody want to buy a big dog tee? I need a buddy for the 2 for $30 deal https://twitter.com/danegado/status/1110597510232305664?s=21 Why's he putting this kinda expectations on our boy cmon Im hearing he will be back by game 7 of the finals Lmao space rode the line down two points Got me at heat -3.5 at tip Did me like a dog Well you know the saying Dane has also been tweeting mad recklessly Yeah hes about to get muted Dude needs a timeout Yeah dude log off for a minute Any of u guys gonna watch this showtime docuseries about sports gambling Its called Action Dude guys Just had an epiphany They did a segment pre game about how Meyers wore two different shoes which inspired dame to do it and nurk did it because dame did it ...

Idk probably Gordon Chris Bosh was so underappreciated For sure HOF I think maybe outside of Miami Hes pretty beloved down there Good point But at large I think when he resigned after everyone said he was off to Dallas He solidified his place in So Fla lore Yeah signing a 5-year after LeBron left https://twitter.com/grabaka_hitman/status/1110702958117875713?s=21 Showed a lot of respect This guys fights for free on ESPN Saturday, and everyone should watch War Gaethje Great game happening in Miami Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck Fuck Im watching the second Harry Potter animal movie, whats the score of the heat game? Space you're not allowed to say fuck that many times if its not because of a horrific injury That's stolen valor from blazers fans A broken heart is worse than a broken leg Matt Listen Chris Bosh had a great moment tonight Lets just leave it at that Why did he get his number retired? He was there for 5 years and wouldnt have a ship if not for Lebron Are they going to retire chalmers Jersey too! LeBron wouldnt have won a ship without him Without udonis ? And ray ray ? ^ I remember exactly where I was when that happened ? https://twitter.com/yahoosportsnba/status/1110720552405078017?s=21 ^ did anyone hammer this Its Boshs fault if we miss the playoffs He was goofing around with d wade at the end of the game while it was 3 point game They went on a run while he was guest commentating They retired Michael Jordans jersey too... When Ray Allen hit that shot spaceman was crying. Now hes the worlds most obnoxious heat fan True story Life comes at you fast! Guys its gonna come down to heat nets in Brooklyn on the final night Look at Brooklyns schedule ? Look at russells lines Lakers are fucking retarded Look at sponsored links by Taboola! But youll NEVER know how low tickets are Dude most of the teams in the league wouldve traded Russell at that point. Literally everybody thought it was the right move for the Lakers. ? Does this make you itch ? What the actual fuck? I don't think every team takes Lonzo 2nd. Which is why they traded him Also they probably could have got more than salary dumping mozgov and a late first. They got lucky with Kuzma there Boucher had a triple double with blocks in the G league playoffs lol LEGEND Nobody doing it with blocks! *hassan whiteside voice* ? https://twitter.com/nbagleague/status/1110736585652355072?s=21 I love the announcer lol If I made an ad that could potentially be offensive to Amish people Id be in the clear right?

Wooten should have Trevor booker'd that LOUIS KING DOESNT GIVE A FUCK Are college players just really bad? Like why does it seem like the defense is so much better than the nba Like can they just not create space? The court is smaller Dicks are smaller too right? Especially compared to like giannis Except for peyton Tru Im why they dont lower the shot clock and make the court bigger Dylan you're right. It's definitely dick size Pritchard is probably 4 inches hard They did to 30. I think next is reset to 20 after o rebound Yeah but so am I and Im almost 30 You think he calls it white mamba Truuuu me too ??

The buzz around him is incredible ?? Do we think the Hornets can go 1-7 in their remaining games? Can the Heat go 6-1?! The heat wont go 6-1 Some fan you are But they can win that 8 seed Detroit, Brooklyn, Orlando and Miami all have tough schedules I kinda ruled the Hornets out maybe that was dumb All Im saying is Dwayne wades final game is in Brooklyn April 10th And I bet somethings on the line Eastern conference basketball bitches! Get with it! lol Im officially nervous about this Raptors bet theyre comfortably in the two seed And I dont see three wins left on the schedule Shut it down raps! Can pacers go 2-5? Utah 5-2!? @bulls, 9th place magic, @7th place nets, @10th place hornets, 8th place heat, @twolves in a meaningless game Today is the day that molly goes down And she goes down hard I see a lot of Ls When ducks win tonight. Who wants me to buy them a ticket for Sunday? Cant go unfortunately To either ?? Ashleys parents are in town so I have prior commitments that I did not know about or was, in fact, informed of and chose to not remember.

I went 1/4 yesterday and picked the only game I didnt want to happen I think I have most of my elite 8 in tact Hopefully I can win this $50 or whatever the first place total is ?? Guys be nice to Houman. All the ppl that were in his pool last year entered the real competition this year If u take the average of Molly's two brackets tho she's garbage At least gauhar is doing it the right way https://twitter.com/realgm/status/1111677968366141440?s=21 CJ for Beal Leggo ???? https://www.instagram.com/p/BvmfGsWHNZN/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=nvcnzl3tigka Guess what Im being asked to post on @nike on Monday ?? #??? #MLBRANDxNIKE I wish #collab Is mlb a sport still Thought it died last year My old nemesis Odell is back Must be in the same category as nascar ?? I thought I escaped him when I moved to global Jesus Houman hes talking about Meyers Leonard Brand not MLB did you not see the hammer? Whoosh My bad...its the start of baseball season I need to put in my two cents Your two cents is worth nothing https://twitter.com/tim_cato/status/1111670129799110657?s=21 This sounds like a math problem Bets pry of the windy pod was him complaining for 20 minutes about how much it sucked to live in Miami during ultra lol Whose driving the bus? Windy at ultra would be a fucking scene ? Lines for tonight What about the limes Unc Kentucky $10 Each Plz and thank you Mark please post the limes as well ? First time I've ever cashed out ahead on Bovada. It feels good Even tho it was all ducks +8 blood money Orange Vanilla Coke with limes I would rather OD on coke than take a sip of Orange Vanilla Coke Id rather do a lime of coke https://www.instagram.com/p/BvmJNAIj-nA/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=cfqs7mxdd2sy Kuzma hating in the comments but that's not even a weird stat Blake been killing it This is kinda moot now (sorry) but would you give cj and a healthy nurk for Blake? No way I dunno man CJ and pieces yes. Nurk is a top 5 center now. May be more valuable than CJ Nurk and Blake? Blake stretches the floor now. They'd both work Mayyyybe but only bc theres not many great centers CJ for Blake easy Should have done it 2 years ago Top 5? Thats kind of a stretch, no? 1. Jokic
2. Embiid
3. Gobert
4. Nurkic
5. Horford? Jokic 
Embiid
Towns
Gobert
Nurkic Are my top 5 Towns I totally forgot lol Also a guy we forgot Fuck you guys for leaving VUCCI MANE off the list Lol no one would do that straight up ?I realize this is one stat but he's in that group for sure CJ for Blake? Jason Smith
Bruno caboclo
Robin Lopez
Zaza
Poetl Do what straight up space? Def could have been done at some point in last 2 Blakes value has been all over the map Anthony Davis Lol did you sort by RPM to prove your point? Agreed Brock. CJ and picks is just as good as Tobias and avery It's an RPM list RPM... meh I qualified it with I know this is just one stat Ah I missed that I mean, regardless. Hes a top 10 cetner Drummond Drummond is not sniffing nurks asshole Drummond is very good too Or at least hes had a strong finish to the season But gimme Nurk Gimme nurk at that price for sure Yeah the contract makes him even that much better. All those other guys are making twice what he is ?Im sorry but you guys are fucking nuts For 2019 playoffs Im taking Drummond Drummond should be a real rim protector and Im pretty sure hes never even led a top 10 defense Those are huge numbers and hes a beast of an offensive rebounder Swap those two Detroit def gets worse Yah but thats all he does. Nurk helps the offense run Drummond did give Nurk problems in the matchup last week but it went both ways Drummond handles the ball better The blazers would be worse with Drummond But Nurk is a better passer and defender imo I dunno mayyybe bc theyd have to change their style of play But I cant get past the 5 rebound difference Well the pistons rebound better with him off the floor Yeah theres a lot that factors into that tho Drummond might be the best rebounder in basketball I think for the money, most gms take Drummond Ian where you at bro Rebounds is a dumb stat Give us rebound rate Thankfully Neil isnt most GMs! If the teams you play miss a ton and you play different minutes It doesnt compare The guy who was smacked and playing salsa out of his car has now stopped playing salsa Was it Mero? Brock Im glad you had the follow up lol Lol see u in 3 mins I felt like I was talking to magic Johnson when I saw rebounds are dumb Nurk tends to get beasted by bigger stronger centers Whiteside Lol dude Ian I think you're way overrating Drummond The numbers are good yes but he's not that great of a defender. I'm pretty sure Detroit was looking to dump him at the deadline cuz he's not worth that contract I'd still have him top 10 center for sure but he's not a world beater He's great but don't be surprised if he's sucks is what I'm saying Simmons doesnt even have him ranked on the trade value column Yeah but nurkic aint exactly Hakeem Nurkic benefits from being on a good team Put Nurk on the pistons I doubt he had the same impact ? Grizzlies picked Jonas over Drummond from the sounds of it To be fair I said contracts aside Lol should I post this on r/nba I wanted to post to r/accidentalreinassance yesterday but couldn't figure it out ? Dame 50 piece tonight? Watching the real Collins of 2017 hit corner 3's ?? Gundy and Ian r together ! Quick start a blazers heat contentious debate they'll have to discuss in real life We have had many We are going to a Heat game tomorrow Im gonna buy a Noah Vonleh Jersey 2019 Blazers with Nurk beat the 2014 heat, prove me wrong Cavs deserve to retire LeBron's number more than Miami 2011 Heat*** Team he was drafted to + team he got last championship on More important than ring chasing Milwaukee isn't a white city Giannis is making it one tho Heat are jersey retiring sluts I dont care about Lebron era heat My allegiance began in fall of 2014 https://twitter.com/bleacherreport/status/1111824418865479680?s=21 ^ this is absolutely hilarious Fuck KD And fuck bob Fitzgerald Fuck these refs! https://twitter.com/anthonyvslater/status/1111835210969157633?s=12 Curry apparently does not care about the incoming 50k fine Mark were even Unfortunately 2 nights in a row Yea...

What the fuck am I looking at Space A cool meme Only share if u can back it up (I can) I saw that on r/cringetopia Lol I think thats where I got it I assume this is how trump got elected. That and Gunde voting for Gary Johnson ?Evan Turner #4 on Reddit Least Valuable Player awards More like Evan Turnover Did not realize he's 16.7% from 3 r u kidding me Bro that is up from 12% Lol since when He's a career 29% from 3 ? Evan (Apple) Turnover Earlier this season when I looked it was 12% and I threw up on myself Fucking raptors win Gg Dubov Are the heat even going to make the playoffs??? Prob not tbh I dunno I think its gonna come down to the Brooklyn game next wed God it must suck to be a heat fan So glad I cheer for a winning team I really think u underestimate the chillness of low expectations Big shout out to the blazers for helping me recover my losses from the Warriors game last night Ians championship was February 5th and he was victorious So is Evan good now that he has back to back triple doubles against the t-wolves and grizzlies? I say yes I wonder if the real Trail Blazers accounted real timberwolves and real grizzled Grizzlies And if so What happened Has Nurk been holding us back? Will Russel get the New contract by April 15? How much?? I bet a fully guaranteed deal, over 100 million Fully guaranteed?! If Kirk cousins got it, russel will Im thinking like 3 years, 100 million guaranteed Goddamnit I had a six team teaser going tonight and the spurs fucked it up what the hell Damn I didn't realize Kirk got his fully guaranteed. That's wild Aaron Rodgers got $103 million guaranteed. That's the bar to top Ahh then maybe 3 years 105? Would put him top for guaranteed and per year average. Or 4 year 130-140?? Yeah lucky for us Vikings fan lol 22 days until the NFL draft ?????? Ill be there at the draft in Nashville Damn jealous, awesome What round are you projected clay Late 5 early 6 Just happy to be drafted Am the only one who took blazers under Brock?? Lol oops That blazer fan optimism Dehaan Im happy to get that pick wrong Take a picture with Kyler for me clay So if we go 4-0 and beat the nuggets twice. We could still get the 2 seed? Would have been cool if you had beat the fucking pistons Wouldve been cool if we had beat the grizzlies in Memphis right Chad Or the heat at home right Ian Exactly Dubov. You're finally getting it Every win matters Or game 6 of the 92 finals Yeah but that one against the pistons really mattered And you fucked me man Or game 7 of the 2000 WCF Just thinking tho. Were too young so it doesnt really matter but if we beat bulls in 92 would that have shut everyone up that we couldve drafted Jordan? Oh definitely Ian this is just setting it up for you to be in Brooklyn with the 8 seed on the line One win against the damn grizzlies standing in our way of a 2 seed. What a shame Well we still got a shit Shot* Lakers shut everyone down for our last game Everybody poops So bummed we will be playing the fakers next week. 6. 2016-19 Meyers Leonard (7'1"): 2220 https://twitter.com/fromal09/status/1113586869697036288?s=12 Get to the Snap Summit and first thing I hear is Believer by ID You should feel special Dubov I couldnt even get into my own partner summit Its ok cam, you can follow my journey on my instagram stories You dick ?

Was she sick? Damn she did? She had cancer Thats terrible Jesus that's awful Yeah not fun - Super sad When do nba playoffs start? Do we have an idea of blazers schedule like dates they would play? Saturday they start We will be an evening game Saturday or Sunday Almost guaranteed cause we are pacific time The warriors series we had a day game either Saturday or Sunday. It was sick because I got absolutely hammered in our Coachella condo before we went in. Damn we almost had that game too. CJ went ham Second round we might get those ideal tip times if we beat Utah Its basically like 95% certainty we host Utah for the 4/5 MITCHELL V COLLINS: The battle for Chads heart! God Donovan Mitchell is gonna fuck us in the ass Bro he might not even be the third best player in the series relax Dame, Meyers,.... Whos the third? ? Removed a heart from Dame, Meyers,.... Whos the third? Lol who's third? CJ? You could make the argument Its not that clear cut to me when Donovan has been Tyreke Evans 2.0 this year The correct answer is Joe Ingles. Cant believe you guys didnt get that. Whoa whoa that's a fuego take my man Tyreke not jingles Am I crazy to think Dame v Curry should be a conversation for the other 1st team guard spot this year? No thats a very legit argument On the windy pod they did the ballot and couple people had dame first team I would give it to Dame Dame is better than Curry in VORP, Win Shares and BPM And their per game stats are almost identical dame has played 11 more games Which to me is more valuable Then consider what dame is working with and we've only won 3 less games https://twitter.com/dame_lillard/status/1115369837411356672?s=21 Dame should be top 5 MVP also no question 100% I would have Jokic over embiid And PG over Durant Dame, Harden, KD, Giannis, Jokic Im 50/50 on PG vs KD. Im good with either. PG was unreal this year But then I realize how dumb fans are when everyone in those comments is saying Russ should get first team lol PG had kind of a rough stretch post injury Which is really my only knock against him And KD is a bitch. So hes got that going against him in my book. So its a toss up Sidebar: Got promoted today Ayyyyyyy Post injury? Hasn't he played like 78 games this year Yeah he only missed a couple games but my point is his performance in those games was... not good ??New drip Thats 100% must cop for you Matt Oh damn Already copped it Those pants ?????? At first glance I thought that was John Cho Movies aint paying like they used to I really want to win the giveaway on the 13th too, the shanghai air Max's https://twitter.com/lilnasx/status/1115398697242615808?s=21 https://www.instagram.com/p/BwA7ijDh2q6/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=1sqfovs6lpvhp Wow what a true honor for Dwayne Wade ?????? ? OmarHoH is South Florida need Bred* Ya I know still find it lame probably just based off of success envy Oh it totally is Wade is still a dad at the end of the day D-wade farewell tour hijacked our season! The rebuild will begin again!!n Unless Spo gets traded to the Lakers I dunno I feel like its just gonna be same shit new season As long as we have Richardson and Winslow U need a super star It's a super star league By same shit new season I mean scrapping it out for the 8th seed lol Get better through the draft that's what the warriors did If only u had a competent GM like neil "the wheel & dealer" olshey at the helm Lol is Neil that bad? Drafted Lillians and cj Traded for nurk I feel like a lot of teams would kill for that lol I mean he's no billy king that's for sure. Could be worse. The main issues are 

1. He's too arrogant to admit when he's wrong and course correct
2. He uses the "small market can't take risks" excuse to not go after any available all stars during unprecedented player movement 
3. The 2017 draft was a total failure. Had 3 1sts in a deep draft and he fucked us Also if you wanna play devils advocate on the draft. Dame was the pretty obvious choice at the time, and he picked CJ over Giannis. The latter nobody really saw coming but still Its going under These mopes may not score 40 points Were getting a Tony in the first half Somebody is finishing the half under 20 This might be lower scoring than the super bowl If you dont love this then you dont love basektball COULDNT AGREE MORE BROCK IM HARD Key to the rest of the game is working the ball around the 3 pt line until 5 on the clock JEROME IN THE HOUSE Heating up! Onions ! Damn Texas tech subs a lot https://twitter.com/tatefrazier/status/1115436026162364416?s=21 Cease & desist ! And we have an over in two points! Ah men Chad Only REAL blazer fans get that Its hard to see outside he also drafted meyers 11th that same draft dame fell in his lap Hmm Lot going on here Well got damn We got a game Lmao Big shout to the over! Reverse Venmo jinx worked perfect Sorry mark bank closed at 7 ? You can just pay Houman when Tech wins ?? That's so ridiculous. Replay overkill Virginia knocked it out ? Can't beat the team of destiny, well played Dubov Both Ducks lost to the champs. I can live with that. Houman just a heads up don't know if Dubov texted u but we agreed to split it regardless of outcome before the game ?? Never has a lamer team won s championship The spurs? The patriots literally just won the super bowl Double reverse jinx? Say it aint so! I dunno I think its kind tight Virginia won Space with the hipster take Like when do one of the like power 6 or 7 teams not win? Alexis Texas tech really took that one in the ass ?Fuck em Can someone send me the payout from the message board. And I will do payout in the AM. I cant access my yaho for some reason on my desktop Laptop* Uh huh. Likely story. And this really only applies to Dubov to do lol And Matt * So does this mean we could have won the championship? At least its new! ? ?The Real Winner Kind of a cool story After last year Suck a dick Ian u sound like Houman I'll give you that space ? Thank you sir ?Picked this off the ground for u Dubov WOWOWOW thank you Rengel that is better than any cash prize But I still want my cash prize I should have made last place pay an extra $20 or something for being terrible Or charged yourself 20 for running the worst pool everrrr You know whats funny Rengel Im pretty sure Matt/Dubov are happy right now those people had 2 brackets Cause they won more money Who won Rengels big money? Enjoy subway Matt and Dubov! ???????? Dont forget to eat fresh Houman dont expect to be invited to my dirty 30 Ill most likely have to work I was kidding. Ill come to ny just for u LOL... lets do it in Iran I know where to find all the good stuff Works for me First we send Dennis Rodman to North Korea, next we send Michael Rengel to Iran. World Peace is closer than we thought.. What if the JCSL reunion was at the USC game in November JCSL STORMS LA YESSSSS Happy birthday Cam! Happy birthday BISCUIIIIT Happy birthday brotha! Lets go blazers baby!! Clinch home court for camss birthday! Thanks boys! Always appreciate the la liga love. https://www.nike.com/t/legacy91-final-four-locker-room-virginia-cap-HdDJm3 might have to officially celebrate my HOOS Thats a very Virginia hat Hell yeah it is I was bummed that I lost but then I remembered that article about that guy that didn't hedge his 300k Texas tech futures bet and I feel better What an idiot So irresponsible Not hedging isnt cool kids He got offered 125k for it said no If its just daily normal betting then yes hedging is lame and probably wasteful And I understand wanted to let it ride But he should have just placed a counter bet at some point If you get to the point its just two teams right I think I did that with the super bowl actually I had a futures bet on the pats but I took the rams in the game Happy birthday Cameron Happy birthday. May your day be more blessed than Dubov last night winning his cash prize HBD CAM Happy birthday. May your day be more blessed than Dubov last night winning his cash prize So nice he sent it twice. Dubov won both pools Houmie so he could probably afford to buy a pool now.. I only got 3rd in the big pool, unfortunately. Damn and he just won my nba over under So maybe an above ground pool Im pretty sure You bet I did, Brock. like a boss nailing every super pick If I hadnt listened to Ian gassing up the heat I wouldve done even better Ill take full responsibility for picking the Spurs under. Fell for it again.

Wont load Usually a gif is a moving image Yeah I know Added it to my shitty photo collection You fucking disgust me ?Lol ?For your gif collection Matt Lol ucla hired mick cronin How do the blazers play out the next 2 games to not play the thunder Would 100% rather play jazz clippers or Spurs We win tonight They lose tonight I think that seals it Houston 3, Us 4 and Utah 5 What if we get the 3 and play the Spurs? Or would y'all rather play the jazz I want no part of the jazz Donovan Michael Jordan Mitchell just scares me ya know I dont want the Thunder Even if PG isnt rigjt Right Thunder will poop on us with our depleted lineup We gotta a fighters chance again Spurs / jazz , I think we'd be favored against clippers Yeah we can pull an upset against the spurs or Jazz for sure They obviously defend like hell but they also cant score The jazz I mean If the Thunder beat Houston then lose, San Antonio beats Dallas, and we win out.. we play the spurs as the 3rd seed But most likely we play the Jazz as the 4 seed like gunz said Yeah a very small amount of scenarios have us in the 3rd seed ??????? look by Turner Lookin like a prefect So if the pistons lose to the grizzlies and Knicks and we beat the sizers and nets and the hornets lose either to the cavs or magic scrubs The heat are playoff bound! Aww sorry man Pull the lever silver! But Ian isnt it really the most important thing about tonight it being Dwayne Wades last home game and the feelings?

This is the equivalent of a championship for blazers fans lol Blazers in 5 We proved people wrong! Also I think Ive been generally supportive of the blazers this year! Thunder in 4 But it was a good ride Youve been as supportive as Trump has been to Puerto Rico Except when you tell us we can't trade CJ for AD Some please @brocialite for cold take roasting My bet for game 1 is Sunday at 7:30 Man there is a strain on fandom in the Pacific Northwestand I root for Seattle teams in 2/3 sports I care about so this includes methan just needs to feel like theyre victimized/disrespected!

Your words were seems a bit harsh Haha wut I didnt realize he was my owner too? Gotta make fun of Meyers dog Honestly made fun of tuners dog when he/she died and I still feel bad about that Turner* Like when my dog eventually dies I wont talk to anyone for a week Thats different Its YOUR dog Not a family dog And he had 2 It was open season And he was being a little bitch about the whole situation Hes in Eugene, the dog is in Hayward Lolol staying out of this one!

What'd I miss with that tweet Self indulgent Hmm I didn't read it like that at all. He was welcoming him to the club Also disingenuous cause he wanted to get traded True but he didn't get traded so don't count lol Super self serving! Plus just fucking wrong Idk I also love everything Kobe does now. Which is funny cuz I never hated a player more when he was playing Chad confirmed kobe stan Who cares if you work for one company your whole life Doesnt say shit about you Yeah Im with Brock Plus anti Lebron shade These teams will trade your ass for a draft pick the second your vertical goes down by half an inch Yeah basically just capitalizing on the moment to remind Lakers fans how much better a Laker he is than LeBron ? When his boy pelinka has them in this mess How the turn tables Lol wait space what does that have to do with the player staying with 1 team I think it's pretty cool in hoops when you've only played for one squad If anything that's even more of a testament to the player for not getting shipped off for cap room Im just saying you dont score extra morality points for having blind loyalty to a franchise that would cast you aside the minute your production declines It doesnt say a lot about you as a person Yeah I mean that part was kinda lame and self serving I agree right Its cool! But playing for one franchise your entire career is pretty cool in general sure But as space said It does say anything about you as a person Also Its pretty transparent For sure I agree with that But it does say that your talents were high enough that they never wanted to trade you. Which says something about your skills Yeah but come on thats not what he was saying We all know what he meant lol https://twitter.com/ballislife/status/1116308361484615680?s=21 Im not joking if Rodney Hood turns back into a pumpkin come Sunday we gotta play Simons https://twitter.com/nateduncannba/status/1116388822370013184?s=21 Okay dude he won 5 rings Dude Nate Duncan can be so insufferable sometimes #whatsyourpoint That's what we call trying to create a take when one ain't there Chris Davis is 0-53 so far this year lmao https://www.instagram.com/p/BwIE8OulHti/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=qk2ky38of9y4 Where's Zach Collins? ?We got two options:

No faith in the blazers Low key blazers have a cake walk to the western conference finals Yeah I went back and fourth on that That said they lose in the first round None of you will like this But my reasoning was you guys got swept by the pelicans with nurk I got Portland in the WCF cuz why not So yeah basically that Why not is Westbrooks line... bad juju Chad! Damian is a different player this year Ian. And we got shooters in Curry and Hood when they trap Im underselling my hope on the conference finals If they do it Ill still be happy Im just scared of la marcus against fucking Kanter Using his juju against him mark Mark I will take $10 on philly with the 6.5 line please Kanter is gonna be bbq chicken on defense but I bet he puts up a few 20/10 games I mean I picked it to go 7 games Its not that disrespectful lol ?

Steph called it pregame 1. Pop 2. Carlisle 3. Rivers 4. Bud 5. Stevens? Dantono Damn yeah I dunno who I knock out tho You know yeah same same Lots of great coaches Kenny Atkinson Stotts 6. Jim Boylen Yeah hard to judge Kerr too Malone Yeah I'd like to see Kerr without 5 all stars I mean to be fair He brought them to the next level Stotts gotta be like top 8 And like you pointed out early He draws up all sorts of creative next level plays Yeah Dwayne Casey deserves a shout Kerr is good but warriors fans just want Steph to run pick and rolls every time and thats not going to work with that many stars Yeah I mean he's definitely legit. Great offensive mind and definitely has respect of players. Just hard to judge with a team that loaded Yeah def I dunno where spo ranks I love spo Oh shit I forgot about spo But he needs to develop an offense Top 10 no doubt Thats not just having three of the best players of his era Grinding it out God the clippers traded Tobias Harris And just beat the warriors at home In the playoffs Jerry west is a god Lmao yeah what'd they get again? Shamet and 2 firsts? Yeah but they got stone-cold giant killer Lander Shamet in return Shamet is the new JJ redick Shamet is fucking nice But he can D up too ? He did good on Steph after Bev fouled out We picked Simons over him but I'm kinda hyped on Ant now Anfernee is gonna be good https://twitter.com/omaroneynba/status/1118028141845307392?s=21 OMG Hey guys now that everyone is all about these teams, I just want you to know they're my favorite teams.

I picture him working at a jersey mikes or something. Just firing off hot takes at his lunch break Def game followers Fake He works for Comcast I believe Doing cable stuff Wow that says a lot about his character Everyone hates Comcast and everyone hates Maroney My father works for Comcast!

Its their only hope I need a warriors dumpster fire in my life KD gonna walk out on the team Bro its Giannis time! The warriors are fucked if they lose any one of three guys As long as Giannis is healthy He can contend! Hes the new guy! Its happening! I love it. Pass the torch bron Honestly I know weve had our squabbles about the fine city of Milwaukee But then being the new team Is inarguably good for Portland, any small market team and the nba on a whole I've just resigned to the fact Portland will never get their shine hiding in the PNW Half the country doesn't even know where Oregon is And goes to sleep before our games start Dude Giannis was the 15th pick Like bro the bucks were like the biggest joke in the league I completely agree. But I'm just saying there's more eyeballs on them than Portland will ever have I mean only bc of Giannis My videogame teammates only speak Spanish and they're using Google translate voice to talk to me lmao there's Hope for this world And paying in the central time zone lol I mean if the blazers had Giannis... Who cares about eyeballs The point remains the same, they didnt build their team through a-list acquisitions Yeah no doubt. Success on the court is all that matters at the end of the day I'm just saying less people notice what the blazers are doing. But yeah the bucks have crushed almost every move Snagging Brogdon and Middleton in the 2nd round. Getting Bledsoe for basically nothing Lopez for the minimum Yeah I mean I see what your saying but the bucks just made people notice them https://twitter.com/anthonyvslater/status/1118034280519573504?s=21 Still not sure everybody did til pretty recently https://twitter.com/nfl/status/1118102315234463745?s=21 Dehaan you were right.

Cowherd says Thunder are a lock That means put the mortgage on the Zers I had to mute Scott foster on tweetdeck Blazers fans are gonna be insufferable tonight Only the Superliga is allowed to hate on Scott foster I have no time for twitter folks What are the chances we pull an Auburn and wheel Nurkic out Gotta save it for game 5 I dont think he can sit on the bench But it would be tight wow the Lakers didnt even call David Griffin Theyre gonna suck forever Damn LeBron should demand a trade To the clippers Didnt lebron act like he didnt know griffins name tho? No he fucks with griff Basically anybody involved in the 2016 title is gold with LeBron forever Except dan Gilbert God if his disabled son goes up there and wins the number 1 pick again I'm gonna be so pissed Lmaooooo Can I get $50 on blazer -1 if anyones looking to unload some bovada cash ?Sweet suit! First glance I thought homeboy behind him had a case for natty light Thought that was natural light for a minute Anyone else think that was natty light? ?? I agree that it definitely resembles a box of natural light American lager Office secretary tried to say old E 40 ounces were 4.3% ABV today lmao Nah they 7%+ ? Pretty cool ? https://twitter.com/nbablackburn/status/1118330509816414208?s=21 Denver Maroney Hot take the nuggets dont have a first star on their roster. This game is ?? Dame and CJ get no love for their ability (Trade CJ for AD) Dame deserves a way bigger national profile Top 10 player Pg has the most beautiful jumper Who are the top 10 Not lebron! Lebron, Giannis, Harden, Steph, Durant, AD, Embiid, Kawhi, Dame, PG. In no particular order KD, Giannis, Harden, Curry, Dame, Russ, AD, embiid, kawahi No one cares about the actual west coast teams besides gsw and lal regardless of who they have 1.giannis
2. Durant
3. Lebron 
4. Harden
5. Steph
6. Kawai 
7. Westbrook
8. Embiid
9. Jokic
10. Dame ? and then lebron So I traded AD for jokic Damn I forgot ad I'd swap PG and Westbrook space yeah I think that squeezes dame out I dunno PG is not top 10 That ridiculous Westbrook is the heart and soul I know he had a great year He's better than Russ He averaged a triple double last year Also Dame is better than Russ and Kyrie No doubt I think real basketball guys agree I dont think dame is better than Russ but this series will say a lot! I think it's close but I'm biased. I think Dame is hands down better than kyrie tho Yeah agreed All the kids just see uncle drew and think kyrie is god I think hes just so exciting bc his handle is insane That player poll was nuts Simmons and rusello said dame over kyrie without a doubt fwiw Yeah his handle is unreal Like 65% of the league said Kyrie had the best handle Take Kanter out with 2 fouls Ferk Agreed Ian Right??? Bring in Meyers! Cant have Zach have to play 30 Yeah so decisive! Give me all the Zach Collins minutes CJ Bout to have a night He will have to play against the warriors CJ has that old man slow mo crossover He has the stop and go though This is a double edged sword for me cause if we win this series or do well in the playoffs Olshey wins ?? With the floater to finish it off Have to put fandom over hatred We werent supposed to make the playoffs so now it is us vs. the critics Yep Olshey is already polishing his narrative. You think he loved the 3 seed last year? How bout back to back 3 seeds That buys him at least another 5 years! Seriously I hate it Whoever designed that biofreeze t shirt should get fired Damn I gotta get heat raps tix HOUMAN U IN Smh someone gotta call Felton chasing The fuck was the help on that?

These upper 30s quarters got me dry Man you need shooters in the playoffs ? Ah Dylan! Thank you for interacting with a brand! Im a sucker for great advertising! ? Meyers Leonard: 9 blocks in (last) 91 games 

Isaiah Thomas: 13 blocks in 76 games (last year in Boston) ?? ? Meyers looks like he doesnt want to touch the ball The Hammer Miles from deep!!!! Meyers is by far the corniest guy in the NBA Without question. Dude is hyping himself up mid play over a routine rebound ? Hopefully westbrrok can get the triple double here and salvage the series CJ > Jimmy Butler Savage Brock Did Meyers actually do anything tonight? Im having a hard time figuring that out He played good d on one possession. Hit 1 three ? It's a low bar Clayton Yes Im more asking because Cox is trying to say he gave quality minutes tonight and I laughed I watched him fuck up like 8 times tonight Lmao what were Meyers and Adams talking about ? Okcs role players a poo poo https://twitter.com/markbrisbois/status/1118377763352776706?s=21 https://twitter.com/erik_gundersen/status/1118374860256948225?s=21 Gunz no he fucking didnt Lol Dont spread that shit youre worse than trump right now I'm loving all these GIF's Nurk is tweeting Anyone know where I can get a meyers jersey?

Not everything is about made shots Kenny Smith make a White Chicks joke about Currys gf? Jesus energy is the bar now? Its the playoffs Id hope so Lol Meyers swung the momentum right Brock Lol Gunz youve got influence on twitter you gotta be more responsible When he tweeted it I will admit that I was starting to root for Meyers Now Im a proud owner of a meyers Jersey ?In Gundy's defense, there's one +/- outlier on the blazers bench... I literally just asked terry about Meyers I kept him out there cause good things were happening when he was out there. SMDFTB Yeah guns you couldve been out there during that time too Correlation does not mean causation, Terry is messing with you! He's just being nice because you're text buddies ! Dont be a hater Clay I mean you cant tell me you watched that game and didnt see Meyers fuck up 5 times when he was in there. He was a breathing human who was on the court. Thats what he did today for the Zers. Thats the closest thing to a compliment I have. Lillard in full assassin mode right now 

Reporter: "what do you have to say to all those who left you for dead after Nurkic went down?"

Dame: "nothing" CJ fielding questions from all the heavy hitters right now; Kevin Pelton, Jason Quick, Erik Gunderson Brock - your answer https://twitter.com/varoonbose/status/1118378464699125762?s=12 ? Im not liking how big these lines are Dylan loves big lines Ill take Houston When life gives you big limes. ?Check out this huge zit on my nose! Driving me crazy! Space you want a 50 spot? Rockets -7 Yeah Dope Gross Wow space crazy you have 3 eyes Pop it for the gram I did it just bled No huge puss explosion :( Weak Fraud You fuckin puss The reach on the @nike Tiger instagram post was 6.9M... Pussy shit Is that a lot? (Serious question) In terms of % its about average ?I never thought I'd read these words in a millions years Just a really nice number imo Organic reach is typically pretty low. Our paid post went a lot further. Oh I get it Ohhhhhh. Nice. COYS Well fuck. SON! MY SON! MY BEAUTIFUL KOREAN SON! This game is fucking drunk No way is AD coming back right??? https://twitter.com/danielatlarge/status/1118273684500881408?s=12 Chad I have no idea anymore The Lakers are trash dude Maybe even AD knows that now And I think rich Paul might be fed up too Time for LeBron to get traded Is LeBron going to be the new director of player ops for lakers My theory is Kobe is sabotaging via pelinka Sam Amick says Kobe has influence behind the scenes with pelinka and Jeanie Worse situation Lakers or Knicks rn? Lakers Thy have immediate expectations and no pick Yeah I think its crazy to think that even like a month ago but I agree also Pretty nuts Dude no one wants to play with Lebron lol Its amazing I really dont know if thats the case I think the Lakers are more the reason than LeBron Jeannie really seems to not know what shes doing Was it Jeannie or Magic? I haven't seen anything that egregious from her And yeah I saw others say that too Gundy. That she chose Kobe over magic. Cuz magic wanted to fire pelinka and she wouldn't allow it Jeanie Shes incompetent She only trusts people who already are part of the Lakers family And worried about the appearance LeBron is in control instead of the Buss fam Okay well magic made all the idiotic signings and trades Then quit on a whim so he could tweet And I agree with space. I don't think people wanna play with Lebron https://www.instagram.com/p/BwWFfu8ASfD/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=1lzscffhpi10x Yeah magic is dumb but Jeanie trusting him after never running a team or so much as working in basketball ops shows shes just as dumb LeBatard was right about magic having no qualifications and everyone called him racist Lebron nailed it! No blame! Okay but I feel like a lot of this is hindsight comments. A lot of laker fans were hyped when magic was hired Funny thing is when they signed all those guys I was like this is genius because there is 0% chance they can contend this year irregardless if who they sign and they were all cheap one year deals so who cares. No one will blame them because you cant win with that roster and you basically just signed all the nba retards so it will be funny It's easy to say now that it was a dumb hire and he had no qualifications Didnt work out that way lol Figured they gave lebron a bad roster on purpose so he wouldnt look bad When the inevitably lost Laker fans are morons So I never cared what they thought Jeannie is the problem here. Hiring magic was a huge error. We now see that, which directly correlates to Jeannie. It falls on her. Pelinka is also in charge now And thats a Jeanie buss decision The Lakers are literally succession Lol yes Yeah I mean she's not great. And she hired magic who was terrible. But don't act like there weren't people hyped on the magic hire Who is Greg the egg? A younger buss cousin I dont know Who works for the South Bay Lakers No youre right and I overestimated LeBrons durability at 34 I thought the Lakers would be a playoff team And the Klutch Anthony Davis thing was his fault But also the knicks have Jim Dolan so they ain't in the clear either lol Actually clay Antwan Jamison is Greg the egg He works for them now lol Nba bet of the night: parlay all of the favorites I cant see a single good game tonight amongst the spread Who in the SuperLiga will get the Zion rookie? https://twitter.com/richeisenshow/status/1118581117655719936?s=12 He lost me at jee-anis Anyone trying to watch the game Friday? Yea Space youre welcome to come to BK if you wanna catch the game on Friday We can watch it at a bar here or my place... whatever works Im not working that night One time j burr made that joke and I showed up Well youre welcome to Wow cold blooded Houman. I dont think Burger King is the best place for spaceman to watch the game. Lmao Im sorry did Eric Bledsoe think he had 18 seconds instead of 1.8 seconds? What the hell was that? Kyrie has 28 but the pacers are up 11 after 3 Yeah what the hell Boston finally stepped up Bucks should try it Blazers are +7.5 Friday ?? Thats an interesting play You dudes ever had problems depositing Bovada checks? I havent withdrawn in a long time Never had problems mostly cuz never took money out only ever put money in Yes dubov You have to go to bank in person In my experience Bitcoin is so much easier **Bitcoin to cash** Ok that what Im wondering Dylan. Because ATM and app deposit dont work. Same thing happened to me just go to bank with ID and they look at you super sketch like you run a human trafficking ring then the money ends up in your account. Also it took me 10+ minutes to get 5 gallons of gas because this chick working at the gas station was just petting dogs in cars on her break instead of just getting the fuck out of the way so the other dude could pump.

Russ is that shit talker everyone wants to punch in the face https://twitter.com/joesimonssays/status/1119453565708169217?s=21 This sums up my thoughts Give these bitches their pity home win and lets close this shit out Doubling down on blazers ML Game 4 Damn I said thunder by 20 they only won by 12 What's up with this Russ Barry Tramel beef? Russ is being sensitive I heard berry say its not personal but its definitely personal What's the origin I dont know But Berry wrote the infamous Mr. Unreliable column about KD I think it honestly might be that deep Holy shit taking back sunday fucking ripped that was so sick They played for two hours. Cant wait to do this again tomorrow night He should introduce himself as Terry Bramel and see if he can trick him into answering Okay I tracked down the Tramel v Westbrook beef timeline for y'all. 

It started in the 2014 Memphis series when Tramel wrote an article which mentioned Durant being "unreliable" from the FT line after missing 3 FT's in the 4th Q of a one point loss https://newsok.com/article/4744653/memphis-defense-has-knocked-kevin-durant-from-his-moorings? The Oklahoman then changed the front page title to "Mr. Unreliable" which Tramel had no knowledge of https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.si.com/nba/point-forward/2014/05/01/oklahoman-apologizes-calling-thunders-kevin-durant-mr-unreliable Durant took the high road and said the criticism was warranted anyway. But Russ called the story "BS" ? That was in May 2014. In January 2015 Russ tells Tramel he doesn't like him during an interview https://youtu.be/nawEqAz-8-s Then in the 2017 playoffs, Tramel asks Steven Adams why the Thunder have such a stark drop off in play when Russ is on the bench. Russ jumps in and goes on a rant about Tramel trying to sow discord between teammates and says "next question" https://twitter.com/mattravis/status/856280495277166592?s=21 Ever since, Russ answers every single Tramel question with "next question" Tramel wrote that he continues to ask Russ questions knowing he won't answer because he doesn't want Russ to feel like he can win, and block out the media from doing their job. But he says he likes Westbrook and doesn't understand the beef https://newsok.com/article/5627448/westbrooks-next-question-act-is-about-control Based on the facts, I'm going team Tramel here. The end #Spotlight ?My dads MySpace top 8 If this happens in Portland Gundy, you should ask the same question https://twitter.com/vkarapetian/status/1119507458408378368?s=12 Blazers +6 https://twitter.com/meyersleonard11/status/1119652424078241793?s=21 Oh I thought it was for HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA Big 420 Mood https://twitter.com/mashable/status/1119686421189545984?s=12 first theyre gonna fence us in then theyre gonna kill us all https://twitter.com/notsportscenter/status/1119456143695392768?s=21 Mark whats the line on Milwaukee I want Milwaukee and Houston It was at 8.5 yesterday when I bet it but its up to 10 Mark lines now ? 4/20 Blaze it ????

The media should just stop covering it. The media should stop covering him period hes ?? Ok blazers +10 wins me my three team teaser after winning a four teamer yesterday Zers ML *also* wins me monies Why are we so garbage in the paint ugh Cause we miss big Nurk ?? Oh boy early Meyers minutes And yikes ... Why is Meyers already flexing We fouled em ZC! Filthy Meyers is killing us right now Whats new? 24 second violation, bricked 3, gives up Morris open 3, late on rotation and Noel dunks Lillard with only 2 with us being up makes me feel a little better Yeah he's distributing really well He'll get it rolling in the 2nd And he doesn't even know what a mid level exception is ET and Felton guarding each other hurts my brain. Both very similar in my mind. Just different shapes. Need Meyers to foul out asap Is Swanigan even on our bench these days? Bro we traded his ass to Sacramento months ago What a freaking casual fan comment This second unit ?? That was huge! 3rd foul on PG Cj or dame needs to be in at all times When r we going to get nic stauskas in there ! Wow Cam Cmon man This is a blazers chat We need to get some shooters in there.

Great end to the half I just finished! ?? Hahaha I mean lets be real. Dame had a similar game last game then went OFF for 25 in the third. What's hilarious is Westbrook seems like he's on fire. I check the box score. 5-14 from the floor lol Inefficiency is in his blood PG didn't play the last 10 minutes of the half tho. We should go at him right away try to draw a quick 4th foul TNT is jerking Olshey off Bittersweet Is Olshey forgiven if we compete in a western conference finals? Dylan I hate to say it cuz I'm petty af, but yes ? Im going for a skinny Steve Keim look Joke for you football nerds out there Lets just say I drove home drunk from the movies earlier Chuck saying we have the best bench in the nba is too much. I couldn't keep a straight face watching that one Dame hasnt done dick and were up Stranglehold time I agree with chad thats a stretch Chuck is probably driving home drunk tonight after that comment. We have a B- bench which is what you need But lets not get it twisted Lets get that 4th foul on PG Early Hes playing soft d there Aminu needs to be Grant last night tonight If PG cant hit those Or Westbrook now We got this bitch Easy money Bowling pins out there right now Grant and Aminu are literally the same player to me Facts LOGO Heat check? ??

Well it is now Space I don't like this death metal BK commercial why did u make it ?? or this one Dylan ?? Woah rengel too far Logo Lillard def a real nickname Wow 64% Thats absurd It confirms my theory that the all star game matters They should move back the 3 point line The big dicks put themselves on the table at all star weekend So only Lillard and Curry are still sick Dame did that this year The media is over compensating hard this year on him and I love it Dame is a blazer for life How did Adams get to that Supermax this summer Cause they feel dumb that hes been this good for actually awhile and finally notice cause he has a bench and big men Its happening #NAME? The dame Easter night performance is gonna be a story told for ages Nah I want AD KD to the Knicks please Aminu for KD and Harkless for LeBron wow Keep shooting Russel! Were out in boogie right?

If youre a guard or wing shooting is 50% of your grade Yeah also how many times did Russ get ripped by dame Tuesday will be the last we hear from them This shows that Westbrook isnt a top 10 player Is anybody arguing that he is a top 10 player? I mean besides thunder fans. Hes not even the best player on his team. Sorry I just used to everyone here dick riding Westbrook Westbrick He Top 10 For sure Hes having a bad series Kinda like how we got swept by the pelicans last year Giannis
Harden
Steph
KD
LeBron
Jokic
Kawhi
PG
Kyrie
Embiid
AD
Dame

Thats at least a dozen guys better than Russ. https://pitchfork.com/news/florida-prosecutors-to-seek-death-penalty-for-ynw-melly/ Is that like a soundcloud rapper or something? Hes bigger than youd think! Did a song with Kanye Is he in Gucci gang? What stage was he on at Coachella Damn thats fucking crazy Ive listened to some YNW melly tracks Yeah hes a solid rapper! He also ALLEGEDLY murdered his two friends and drove their bodies around in a car for an hour to play it off as a drive-by. Oh my god Pretty cold! Thats so fucked up Yeah I mean I dunno what else you do at that point https://open.spotify.com/track/7eBqSVxrzQZtK2mmgRG6lC?si=fFxMdNxMTDmXe0-gHYTTtA His hit song for the uninitiated No offense Ian but who hasnt done that ? We all make mistakes https://twitter.com/rashadalaiyan/status/1118373655078215682?s=12 My GF gets to meet the Inside the NBA crew tonight Told her to pound Charles and say Blazers to the finals ? Dylan you should advise chief https://www.fastcompany.com/90337130/the-end-of-likes-instagram-follows-twitter-in-mulling-downgrade-to-influencer-mentality?utm_source=Hashtag+Sports&utm_campaign=472f582355-HSD_January_15_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_ebc768df89-472f582355-309860041 sad day for influencers everywhere if/when this happens Ive always thought if they did away with likes and publicly showing number of followers It would just change everything As a non Instagram user, this is great I dont understand how this would help instagram Everyone hates influencers but arent they good for the platform? And likes I was kidding about the influencers piece Get rid of likes everyone uses instagram less, am I wrong? If your brand is hiring influencers based on like count then they should probably fire their marketing dept It gives facebook all the power You have to advertise through them to get metrics now All in the name of mental health If youre advertising with them you would still see your reach which is more important anyway Right, but now you cant go through influencers anymore. You have to work with Instagram directly Or am I missing something If the influencers have a business account they would still be able to share that data with you But you wouldnt be able to just scroll through their profile and see likes, youre right And if they arent willing to share the data with you then theyre full of shit and you shouldnt be working with them anyway The influencers, that is. I think they might just being thinking ahead I kinda feel this is the future of social media Hopefully it improves the quality and the user experience And it would be better to get out in front of it than have some new platform burn them down I feel like its something Kevin systrom has wanted to do for a while but I bet his facebook bosses wouldnt let him https://twitter.com/realcallahan/status/1120395951691190273?s=21 lol Callahan has been fucking on one about Tillman today I always look forward to April 22nd because its the one day a year we get to revisit everyones pat tillman takes. RIP. Are we gonna get a couple sweeps tonight? What's everyone's thoughts on the Kate Smith drama Who? Some singer from the 1930's. Flyers and Yankees pulled her God Bless America rendition because people surfaced some racist comments she made 100 years ago Flyers even had a statue of her they took down Some singer named Kate smith from the 1930s turned out to be racist? wow. Really makes you think. Right Lol yeah I mean your timelines off But yeah So whats the issue here? Some people are offended by shit she said forever ago and some people are pissed theyre taking down statues and removing songs because you cant change history - is that basically it? Spot on You can guess which side clay travis and Whitlock are on lol Alright well then why dont they just move the statue to a museum so the people who get off on Jim Crow era history can still go jerk off to it and the people who are offended dont have to see it when they go watch white Canadians and Europeans hit each other with sticks. Yah idc either way. Def not a confederate statue situation but why she have a statue anyway Yeah idk why she had a statue haha Frankly Im more bothered by the fact that theyre still playing god bless America in stadiums Fuck the national anthem also Yeah they should cut that out in general ? ^ always relevant https://twitter.com/rodger/status/1120391261851148290?s=21 I think my new favorite thing is tracking QB busts in the draft Is Daniel Jones the Duke guy? Also, is the jury still out on Josh Allen? You mean Todd Heap with a good arm? Hes not going to go first round I dont think Josh Allen will be a sneaky fantasy guy next year imo He gets the rushing yards and Tds He loves getting obliterated converting a 3rd and 6 with his legs Who doesnt love that! He should switch to tight end lol Wouldt want him on my real team Dont think you can afford him anyway, Brock. You gave all your money to some other guy already. Its a privilege Russel Wilson sucks Todd Heaps license still suspended? Whoooo000! Wonderlic leaied Leaked* Kyler Murray lowest QB score (20) Baseball players are dummies Theyre still giving these guys the wonderlic? Does that shit have any correlation to football performance whatsoever? HOF cornerback Patrick Peterson scored a 7 FWIW Frank Gore got a 6 and he might pass Barry Sanders for 3rd all time in rushing this year so who fucking cares Janikowski got a 9 but he can kick the ever-loving shit out of a football Ray Lewis got a 13 and he outsmarted the cops Morris Claiborne got a 4 and he was trash I don't think it correlates to anything football related tho. Maybe for QB's but that's it Josh Allen got a 37 and Baker got a 25 CASE CLOSED Lamar got a 13 Brees got the same score as jameis winston Cam newton 20 Jameis scored high CASE CLOSED https://twitter.com/the_coleanthony/status/1119418005560029184?s=21 I find it hard to believe hell pick us at 5:50 in the morning but maybe Im overthinking that Who knows! Hopefully his pops told him how awesome Portland was I listened to an interview where he said hes fine with Portland claiming him as he was born here I actually remember when he was born I think it was during the WCF against the Lakers So hes bad luck? The bucks spread is 13 and I feel like it would have to get to 18 before I wouldnt bet Luke Walton is getting sued for sexual assault Holy shit I just saw that By whomst GF is on the TNT set and said everyone is talking about it Oh wow Broke on tmz I guess Kelli Tennant? https://www.tmz.com/2019/04/22/luke-walton-sued-sexual-battery/ https://twitter.com/complexsports/status/1120487713306763267?s=21 I feel like rn Would be a good time to hammer Milwaukee I just did Damn Gundy you make a buck? https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YwZ2NbvpT50eSKtZlku2KVLQeJ5557H111uTlyHfqMw Yessir I doubled my position at halftime First Bucks playoff win since Ray Allen and the big dawg led Milwaukee in scoring Rockets live is a play Right now Alright Im going to game 5 Chad I remember that series when they beat the hornets What in the hell is chris Weber talking about Big mood https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1120548606392639488?s=21 Lmao what is going on out there Sarver at work ?5 coaches in 6 years.

Not gonna like I didn't even know who Frank Clark was Interesting Chiefs will give all that up and pay him and not dee ford I think its a fair deal Frank Clark was a machine Only at 60% or whatever he claimed too And the Chiefs sure are committed to having at least one domestic abuser on staff at all times! Dee Ford wouldnt fit in their 4-3 scheme they switched to Hence why they wanted a guy like Clark instead Benefit of having QB on rookie scale Chiefs and rams window gotta take advantage Dylans going to have 2 QBs on rookie deals, how fun! Unrest in SF Robby Gould DEMANDS a trade COME BACK TO CHICAGO ROBBIE WE LOVE YOU Specific Prediction: hawks take Jerry tillery 21 has more sacks than frank over next 2 years ? https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1120779790791979008?s=21 ?Vanterpool and Tibbetts interviewing together ??SCOOTERS ARE BACK FRIDAY??

- the same distance as stephs
- won a series and celebrated less than Steph 
- was a step back versus momentum going forward And that Steph shot was still dope Oh and Dame didn't bank it https://twitter.com/worldwidewob/status/1120945876212617217?s=21 Some poor bastard is gonna have to tattoo this photo on dames back Chads*** Hahaha ? https://okcthunderwire.usatoday.com/2019/04/24/learning-from-the-trail-blazers-could-help-the-thunder-figure-it-out/ ?Is this appropriate office attire?

Anyone else have a wet dream last night ? ???????? But he took a bad shot to get to 50 so it doesnt really count https://twitter.com/chrisbhaynes/status/1121075719117901826?s=21 Must read. Chris Haynes always gets the best dame quotes I lost all respect for PG last night. Fuck that guy. ? Hes such a bitch What part of that bad shot was responsible for you being down 3-1? Or you hiding on defense on Moe and Aminu? And he let Westbrook bully him into signing a 4 year contract to stay in OKC. That was a bad shot. Westbrook was hiding too. They kept putting Schroeder on dame You were literally on Russell Westbrooks team all season and *that* was the bad shot you took issue with? Give me a fucking break you clown I had to hop on the Thunder SB nation message board. It was great lol Omg Chad any greatest hits? ? I saw a good one yeah. One sec ? Lillard also told Westboork mid game "stop running from this ass whooping" when he switched off Dame lmaoooo Lmaooo noway Dude read the Haynes piece. It's pure gold Haynes dropped the mic with a triple double comment at the end too Oh guys Also I was sitting next to Casey when he sent the PG quote to dame Dames response: pussy shit lmao Im dying at all of this. That lakers fan in that hates Dames hero ball probably also loves Kobe That's amazing Dame wants all the smoke Gundy, could this potentially sway voters to put Dame on first team over Steph? I know it's supposed to be regular season but they haven't voted yet have they? I think they technically have voted already Gotcha Void all those votes They de voted already A couple more footnotes about the game last night 

- OKC shot 55% from the field and 45% from 3 which makes the win even wilder 
- Brandon Roy's comeback against the Mavs was also on April 23rd ?? https://www.instagram.com/p/BwpQdKmn4Fq/?igshid=rgmw2zxs6dnp If giannis gets mvp this year I think dame wins it next year Where the fuck you finding all this Chad? Haha. Keep me coming Remember when "is Dame a top 5 PG" an argument? Lol Not for us, but for dumb media and people like spaceman Hey now back up off us media peeps Next question If we wanna talk about bad shots, lets talk about the two free throws PG bricked. Jackass. or how the 8 mo missed didnt matter Mo made the 4 most important FTs of the series in my mind He did Redemption I drank a CJ Whirled from jamba today but lets be real it Dames world and we are all living it Game 5 is on NBA TV Oh shit Im putting it on rn https://twitter.com/worldofisaac/status/1121004475471290368?s=12 You know how the warriors have a remix for E-40's "Yup". We needa bring lil flip outta retirement to make a "Dame Over" remix Also I hope yall cashed out on blazers +155 for the series ? Donovan should be fire Fired* Concurred! Zach Lowe said people are sleeping on Lamar Hurd They just picked up his option like 3 months ago lol so they'd have to eat a lot of cash Maybe Presit should be fired?? Ohh didnt know that Chad The mike and mike switch was such an unequivocal upgrade Also Calabros call Look how mangled their cap situation is hoomie So much better than Mike and Mike Not saying I'd fire him, but he deserves some heat as well Their roster sucks man Patrick Patterson was a waste of money They really relied on Felton Steven Adams got exposed this series too. I still think he's a beast, but with dynamic shooters in the pick n roll he's unplayable Can't play Adams And he's making more money than Nurkic, Aminu and Collins combined ?Gross Lol I just walked past jimmy butler in Central Park Was he screaming at birds Paying $26MM for a center not named Jokic or Embiid is idiotic Watching that shit on tv just added a whole other level to it Being in an arena and being united in hate of a single individual is such an incredible feeling The random high fives and hugs with strangers is something that only sports can do Or when we killed Osama I was living in Miami when Fidel died Was at a heat game at the time! And I drove to little Havana after just to check it out People were going bananas! No They were going plantains! ? https://twitter.com/suns_reddit/status/1120815264696819712?s=21 I'm fucking dying haha. Robert Sarver is the fucking worst Funny story, at the company holiday party when I was there. I quit the day before and was moving to SF, so Colby came out and partied with me instead. Turns out Colby won a raffle for $10,000 from Sarver. But you had to be present to claim it Probably the only cool thing Sarver has done. Don't worry I made sure to buy Colby a beer to make up for it https://www.instagram.com/p/Bwpkp2lgUNO/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=1epm6u6g1s0gr With Kyle Singler guarding. He didnt really have an option Does Dame going supernova get us on AD's radar this summer? Chad have you not listened to a word Neil has said? Were not on any big free agents radar. Lol low expectations. He's a salesman But this would be his trade radar to be fair It's a fools errand tho cuz we know Neil won't pull the trigger And AD might mess with the chemistry hes been building for 4 years. I heard he might try and give meyers an early extension to make sure he is a blazer lifer What about KD... Is he still leaning Dallas? Nah hes going to the Knicks Gross Have fun getting stomped on by D Lo and Giannis They could get KD, Kyrie and Zion tho. That'd be an instant playoff contender Gundy I just realized we may have to delay the draft pod this year until we're done playing in the finals Man Id like the knicks to be good that would be fun I just dont see it I feel like we have this convo every 3 years. Whether its Lebron or KD the first time etc etc Totally agree. They strike out every time I hope they get Zion tho cuz fuck Dan Gilbert and his 4 number 1 picks already, and fuck Robert Sarver They have to successfully do like 3 things plus get lucky in one offseason. And they do 1 smart thing out of 10. Mark lines? ???? Sometimes you gotta turn lemons into lines ? You guys Who you got in a fight dame or Westbrook? I think dame would put up a good fight even tho Westbrook is more explosive they arent that different in size I know who I would take in basketball Oakland, bitch. I got Westbrook, hes the stronger dude but yeah hard to know He couldnt back Dame down for being stronger tho That was what made the whole rock the baby thing so funny Westbrook is taking contested midrange jumpers acting like he just overpowers dame Hes so powerful he cant get to the rim ? Lets not forget the consensus baddest dude in the nba is from Wyoming! Just out of curiosity lol Why is Charles Oakley on this list? Misinterpretation of the nature of the question Breakside doing 50% off beers today and tomorrow in celebration of Dames 50 burger I would have drowned in breakside ipas if I lived anywhere near it Im working on it Ive got a chest cold but Im pushing through for Dame Thank you for your bravery Anything for my guy 0 ? Holy shit #VegasSources RosenSZN https://twitter.com/sagesteele/status/1121234383300698112?s=12 Patrick fucking Beverley is the Captain now Id buy a fucking Beverly jersey if I thought hed ever stay on one team Who cares Pat Bev is the franchise 71 at half lol Patrick Beverly Sounds like a guy that plays polo or something And yet hes a pirate looking dude from the southsidrn Southside Damn didnt realize he was from chi Dude hes hard core chi Hes from the west side Garfield Park Oh my b All good Still south of downtown (I think?) Anybody wanna bet me on bucks Celtics I want Celtics Yeah Whatever you want playboy I love my bucks 50 bucks on the series Ill take your money! Jaylen brown and Jayson Tatum are going to show Milwaukee what playoff basketball is like Not to mention uncle drew Lol Giannis is gonna Reinvent what all of basketball is like Giannis has never been here! I mean I feel you but its Giannis and bud Hes too dominant man Whos gonna stop him? Bud? Who cares Wait and see! The Celtics have 5 guys they can throw at him Bodies matter more than strategy in the nba playoffs imo Im glad we bet Bro I cant wait my energy on this Im just trying to figure out how Im gonna spend your 50 dollars Maybe Ill buy like Two beers with manhattan prices lol Or one cocktail ! Yeah and then step on a rat on my way out lol As a fellow bucks championship backer, I'm with space on this one Giannis is gonna dick slam Tatum or anyone who tries to guard him I know right!? Thats the thing Nobody can stop him But Boston can stop everybody else U understand that Milwaukee is better than any of Lebron a Cleveland teamsand significantly better than the last 3, right? Make Giannis score 60 points a game George Hill is washed Who is sterling brown! Bro you need to make peace with the fine city of Milwaukee This hate will eat you up inside! DJ Wilson? Who! I hate Boston But the fucking Celtics Are just deeper When Semi Ojeleye benches Giannis on the post >>>> Bro you're purposely leaving out Middleton (all star), Bledsoe and Lopez lol And they'll get Brogdon back ? The Celtics have a bunch of stars who have actually won in the playoffs before Mirotic could be a wild card too Congrats to Brogdon and Middleton for beating the pistons Gundy youve lost your damn mind With Blake griffin on a bad knee Dubov I will bet you too I have held firm on this take since October Boston is the deepest team in the league Im with Gundy I could see it I think Boston would win but also don't be surprised if they don't. There's just so many good teams My guy the Celtics have hustled so hard this year Happy to see the hard work pay off!!! I think its Boston or Toronto The bucks arent the 77 blazers Celtics are gonna fall apart and Kyrie is gonna have a meltdown Can we just skip ahead to Bucks/Raps ?I think it's one of the teams Greg Monroe played for in the last 2 seasons The best thing about the Celtics is Janos Ok Brock Ill take your money too! Dont sleep on philly tho Bro is Bostons starting 5 even that much better than Milwaukee if you remove Kyrie and Giannis? Yes And what about the second 4! Playoff series are at least 9 deep Yeah I mean Ill give you that But I actually am not sure Youre right about the starting 5 Bledsoe, Middleton, Lopez and Brogdon? Its a risk Thats a fucking squad lol It means betting on the Celtics to think about the team and the bigger overall bag above their own conceptions is themselves I feel like theyve seen enough guys get bags to see winning gets you paid I have no idea what that means The Celtics are mercenaries The regular season shit is meaningless They were waiting for this moment Or they had a fluky run in a wack conference one time But well see Please remember that the pacers are also garbage lol Post-dipo at least Detroit is also garbage I know But include the last two years Detroit is not a real nba team You can not convince me otherwise Detroit sucks so does Indy That would have been a seven game series lol Those two But 2017 Does nothing for me But I still believe the bucks are better than any east team The east was hot garbage And they got obliterated by a team worse than this Milwaukee one And also Man I believe those Celtics teams knew some shit Had a completely different roster lol The way they dominated Philly I also hate Kyrie so I may be biased I know I know Milwaukee has never been there Thats very fair But you're alone on this one gundy Even 538 had a study that showed experience matters About philly In the nba playoffs That was nuts But is time for Giannis to ascend Okay experience may matter, but how about momentum? Dude but LeBron had to lose first He didnt just go from the first round to the finals
 I also think its worth noting Milwaukee went 7 with Boston last year Yeah but Milwaukee has? Giannis and LeBron are the only Nike signature guys I like now Im sick of Lebron Retire already! LeBron should be player coach A la Lenny Wilkens Hes too afraid of accountability https://www.instagram.com/p/BwqjLX4BXRa/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=14hsysqum1szq To ever do that Dame setting the tone for the youngsters Tbh I'm kinda over lebron too lol Hes just smart but bland guy lol Dude the Lakers are just depressing He fucked it Up At least they got rid of that rapist head coach of theirs!!!! By going there Lol fuck the lakers I love it With a bit of a (earned) god complex Just all the drama and ego and passive aggressiveness The lakers are succession The lakers wont win another title in our lifetime. FAX ONLY I love it Dylan Neither will the Knicks James Dolan and his never ending supply of Filipino blood boys will outlive all of us Lol With the Knicks Another? How old are you Dubov..... Dolan will sell the team and theyll be fine The lakers are full on fucked Are they? They should just do what Lebron says Until they get olshey! See if it works Nah. He wont. He would rather watch the world burn than relinquish control. And if not and where will that get them tho? Burn it down Meyers Theyre still the number one free agent destination And Im 28, Ian. I know I seem older, but its true. And its not even close Good building block with lebron I think Jeanie Buss is just a bad owner I bet shes a great lay tho Lebron will be washed by the time theyll have potential they dont have time Assuming none of us die tragically young (knock on wood!) the lakers are like one of the worst teams to stitch that to to That take to* Free agent destination my ass. Ask steve nash and Dwight Howard how that worked out? Lol fuck off Players move to LA and stop caring about basketball Cause its the best place in the world to be rich You dont believe what youre saying lol DONT @ ME I bet LeBron and Jeanie are boning Is Dylans actual take And magic knew about it and couldnt handle it The lakers will not win a title by the time the first one of us is grandparents. So thats like 12 years for me basically LA will never be a successful basketball city be its full of me-first basketball players who are only in it for the same Fame* God damn dude I told you to lay off the cowherd Cowherd loves LA dude and fuck cowherd Hes washed I turned him off 2 years ago MJ will lead the Hornets robs title before Buss leads the lakers to one Lol owners dont matter that much (dont tell that to heat fans) this isnt even a hot take we all just grew up with the lakers being amazing Who would you rather drive across the country with: Cowherd, Rovell, or Clay Travis So did our parent and their parents but hey Times Changin Rovell for sure. Id at least learn a useless fact or business angle Yeah lol Donald trump is president now Ian Throw everything post WWII out the window ITS A NEW WORLD I actually love rovell hes a source of joy and the best comedian on twitter Clippers will win one before the lakers Although a very harsh critic of my advertising Clay Travis would be insufferable Clippers getting kawhi? https://www.instagram.com/p/BwqevKiBOnk/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=l2nxca87ru ESPN getting cucked by B/R Gunz gets it "You're gonna be all over bleacher report now" -cp another NOT hot take Bro the rockets can take them ESPN is basically half ass CNN and is dead.

Afflalo trade still haunting us Lillard getting the Morey whistle! Over ?? Dame. Time. Bitches Evan turner defense! That better be a common foul he just whiffed I hope so Itll be a flagrant 1 They always give accidental shots flagrant 1s So bad So stupid It used to be intent Now it's result You cant stop your hand Nice of the broadcast crew to just call Jokic ugly lol Dont worry youre not gonna be on the cover of any magazines, maybe the sports ones, not GQ Still a lot of time Not feeling to hot right now I feel like Embiid on the shitter pre game Im not either but we just need some stops If we get a few I believe Dame can get us the buckets Damn am I safe to cabs marks 50? Cash* Ugh thats brutal That's a fucking joke Get your face out the way Mo playing like he wants Rodney to start on a Wednesday Dude what is moe supposed to do Im watching game of thrones again Jokic has fat privilege Moe is having one of the worst games of his career God dammit Aminu CJ got the best hands in the league on those strips tho Fuck That was brutal couldnt stop Malik Beasley! Lmaaaaaao Beasley is legit Moe & Aminu a combined 2-6 With 8 fouls Wtf are these fouls Jokic getting every whistle Damn sorry you guys got linked by bootleg monte Ellis Dames turned into quite the complainer Jokic or James harden How is jokic getting prime shaq whistles Jamal Murray is such a pussy Wow Seth come on That was exceptionally stupid by Murray Lol goddamnit if he blows this cover Live line was 8.5 Make our free throws wouldve Please do not foul I should have been there tonight. This ones on me guys Dame needed some motivation I should have too Damn mark this is payback for last year lol Jamal Murray > Kyrie Dames only missed 2 was that open layup in the 4th that shoulda been a foul anyway 8-9 from two CJ just unacceptable tonight The last 4 minutes were sloppy as all hell and our wing players On both sides I also think we ignored him too much We need CJ to run point Just to change things up Every so often Yeah CJ came out hitting. Then got real quiet Instead of Evan turner agrees Aminu and Harkless are the keys tbh. One can be bad, but not both Also why did Terry our Harkless on Jokic in the 4th? That's suicide. He should guard plumlee Put* God it does suck that we blew the Rodney Hood Game Yeah cam Some very fine people On both sides We just gotta be better Dame got ripped too many times by Jokic Cant have that shit Its gonna be a great series This is the most fun the playoffs have been in a decade Can't wait for GS to finally lose Man that would be so dope But I dunno Fucking Durant man Its just up to him If he flips the switch its over Yeah right now Durant is just automatic And theres no option to swarm him defensively with Steph and Klay Hes the best player in the world Dont piss off giannis! Giannis aint ready Game two tomorrow Lol anyway I'm just happy steph is showing is true colors Like all these series are fun to talk about Averaging the same as siakam It's KD's team Yeah I wonder if the league has the warriors figured out more than ever before But still has to face the fact that they have the best one on one guy in the league We really got robbed of some great years when he went to GS He came
So close to taking them down with Russ Yeah that was terrible for the league Kenny with some lazy analysis saying our small backcourt hurt us against Murray and Harris. They're both 6'4 Still so wild to think okc had Westbrook, Durant, harden and ibaka Yeah FOH Kenneh Lol the team have been better without Russ Literally lol Not be Russ is bad But they chose him over harden Lol yeah especially if he's on a down slide Durant and harden at this level would have been the best scoring combo in nba history Or just keep harden over ibaka They were trying to "balance the team" and kept the big guy Yeah but I mean I dont know if he would have ever become what he is now Yeah them choosing Russ over Harden is the one nobody talks about Russ woulda had way more trade value too Since harden was still a 6th man Embiid really rocked a Hulu has live sports hoodie post game lmao He stepped up tonight too Ian who did that ad campaign https://twitter.com/bengolliver/status/1123105312003612672?s=12 Scott Foster reffing Warriors Rockets tonight!!!! Saw that. Cant wait for that to be the storyline all game ?? Im totally gonna watch but Ive never wanted to watch a series less Unreal https://twitter.com/MrMichaelLee/status/1123067426516668416?s=20 Anyone else here think Brett brown might suck? Maybe but he did good adjustments yesterday Maybe Jimmy just sucks Greg Monroe X factor last night Yeah but I think theyre gonna get stomped still Fair When they play inspired on defense they really become different. Simmons did a good job on Kawhi But theyre so maddeningly inconsistent they wont keep it up Yeah I know theyre good I just think theyre good in spite of Brett brown Now the other way around If Simmons could shoot do they become actually good? They are actually good lol The west has the best team in the league but the east has the next 4 Lol what Ian youve been on this east > west all year It aint true Yeah I think. Milwaukee, Boston, Toronto and philly are better than Denver or Houston? Its not that crazy lol But Brock defense! Im kinda with Ian here All the top teams in the west ran train though the east I mean the east was absolute garbage from 4 down Philly is the only team I would argue that isnt better than the Non-Warriors west Yeah but weirdly they might have the best roster on paper Just because their bench is terrible But they also have the best starting 5 To be fair, the blazers are 4-0 vs Boston and philly Im checking to see how these teams did against each other Ill share my results Philly is a bad matchup for the Blazers They have trouble with quick guards I mean the blazers are a bad matchup for Philly Brock does have a point

Blazers 6-3
Nuggets 5-3
Rockets 5-3 Though the Celtics really fouled that up And theyre a different team in the playoffs Celtics regular season data was poisoned Celtics went 0-6 against those 3 teams And I think to an extent Milwaukees regular season was overvalued Lol its been one game I mean that was my pre-series take No I mean with Milwaukee But whether it turns out is TBD Milwaukee went 5-1 against those west teams They lost to Portland tho! Yeah the first time around (And beat Portland by 43) They also beat them by 43 Lol https://twitter.com/mjsgoat/status/1122854593564745728?s=21 Everyone on KD's jock, meanwhile Dame is averaging 34 ppg in 6 games Milwaukie is good. Westerners will concede that Lmaooo @ westerners The Ayatollah of Milwaukee is good, Westerners believe The west values freedom of expression on offense Guards have rights! https://twitter.com/larrydn22/status/1123249015552917504?s=21 Savvy move By Nance? Yeah I feel like the Lakers got to him lol Im convinced the Lakers are the mafia How does that Luke Walton lawsuit not come out until after he leaves the Lakers? That is kinda wild Also funny that it's a civil suit only. So this chick doesn't even want to press charges she just wants money? I think she just knows that she wouldnt be able to win a criminal case Its not that uncommon, she wouldnt have a chance at a criminal case Based on the evidence Civil suits are just more likely than not Criminal is beyond a reasonable doubt I agree it's definitely easier to win. Just seems like a strange move when that happens Im sure she consulted with an attorney prior to deciding lol Aka the Lakers mafia Robert Todd Pelinka Jr.[2][3] (born December 23, 1969) is an American (NBA) team executive, lawyer, sports agent, and former college basketball player from Lake Bluff, Illinois (suburban Chicago).[4] Pelinka is currently the general manager of the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA).

Monmouth is on the rise. ? Brand new Carls Jr. Oh fuck thats awesome Carls fucks Gundy this Venezuela shit is wild Every day man Ive honestly lost the ability to feel any type of way about it My office is right next to the Venezuelan consulate and theres a big protest going on rn This is such a messy situation Gundy can you help me understand? Guaido is the interim president and believes he is the rightful winner of the election? And Maduro is holding on? But the US backs Guaido and Russia backs Maduro?? Yes maduro is holding on because he has the generals in the military as well as support from Russia and China Guaido kind of just showed up, he won a parliamentary election of some sort because the actual elections are pretty widely acknowledged, even among former government members, as completely rigged But Guaido is also doing this knowing full well the people of Venezuela cant take this anymore Yeah I remember reading about this election His politics aside, he wants maduro out because people want him out And Maduro literally releases people from jail To be government loyalists on television Because there are none left gotcha Maduro has also made deals with a lot of motorcycle gangs in Caracas Im not even joking lol Thats wild It all sounds like an insane movie Yeah for real My Uncle got jumped in east Venezuela taking shit to the dump, he refers to the climate as Mad Max So there you go lol Jesus Im honestly surprised that Trumpito and his goons are backing Guaido He can win Florida again if he does its smart by him Maduro gave Trump 500k for his inaugural to try and buy him Interesting But if Putin can guarantee him a re-election, wouldnt he want to align with Putins boy Maduro? I just dont think theres a lot of trust on either side of this Putin and Trump helped each other but I dont think they trust each other Are you suggesting that pathological liars arent to be trusted? Lmaooo ? Mark Lines? My Spurs are looking like butt right now. I havent been watching but Ajax is a team of destiny Yeah and Tottenham are playing like they just learned about soccer Does bovada let you bet team fouls props? BetOnline does not Lol Dubov making this reffing nightmare work for him #Degenius I dont see any foul props on bovada either Lame If mark is really the big dog I bet he could set a lime Lmao its EOM I got 9 calls you marketing cucks ?

Yeee Ive got the Milwaukee Cucks https://twitter.com/_dlew32/status/1122946709628313601?s=12 Gundy idk about that Jokic take. Harkless and Aminu got abused. They're too slight Bruh we cant do anything else Put our best two defenders on him Kanter sure as shit cant do anything At least those guys can get into his dribble And we will see it Jokic gets such a favorable whistle in Game 2 Idk man. He's too big IMO. He got the ball above the FT line and just backed them both down The slightest banging and they called a foul every time All we got his Kanter and Meyers Meyers wasnt too bad except when he could remember to hold his hand up Couldnt Yeah that was bad. Meyers always plays too far off cuz he's afraid of getting beat Put the better players on him period Go down with your best guys imo If we can force Jokic to live on the perimeter im all for it And without Nurk its those two But dude he will absolutely abuse them in the post Harkless is lacking 30 pounds on Millsap. Double that on Jokic Ok you have a problem but what is your solution? How do we force him to stay out there? I have no clue. I don't think we can. That's what I'm saying is if we can magically force him to live on the perimeter, then sure put aminu and Harkless on him But that won't happen so imo all we got is Kanter and Meyers lol I'd love to be proven wrong tho Kanter on Millsap also has bait potential Harkless also needs to fucking sack up and punish them for putting Murray on him Force them out of what they normally do to attack a mismatch This might be a Layman series Mark is the line on Houston 5? Ahh 5.5 Ill take Houston Its 5 now But you took it at 5.5 Ok cool Because Im the nicest degenerate you know LFG MIROTIC Theres gonna be a fight tonight lol Theyre just hammering Giannis when they get beat Thats what Meyers shouldve been doing on Jokic https://twitter.com/MichaelGrant_CJ/status/1123217108589076481?s=20 Haga haha Damn Sorry Matty https://www.instagram.com/malpugh/p/Bw5EsQOH1WP/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=wrp5m0vt7bdp My friends little sister got that Hulu money too I need some of those Hulu has live sports slippers This game is ??

Idk about animal kingdom but claws go hard I feel like Milwaukee wants Tatum shooting as much as possible Definitely Tatum post ups are my least favorite Celtics play Chad loves animal kingdom almost as much as he loves diet peach Snapple People need to stop exclaiming how wild and modern it is for a big man to make a 3 Thats been a thing since like 2000 Kris Middleton god damn Animal kingdom and the shitty tnt shooter series are my vices Animal Kingdom is the shit!

Now its just business as usual They should do one of these corona ads of me drinking Coronas in my shitty apartment I only saw one tweet about it too May every series be 1-1! Were conditioned to it I wish we were only talking about these two powerhouses. - Ernie re: referees. Ok so then just talk about the powerhouses. I dont wanna hear about the refs.

Im rooting for Scott foster to hand out so many Ts that nobody is eligible for the next round so its just another Portland vs Denver series Man I wonder who out of this generation of hoopers Will be a good analyst The fact that they get 7 techs before suspension is outrageous I think Draymond has potential As a new age Barkley Lol I was thinking the exact same thing Draymond is insufferable #FutureBlazer I think dwade is gonna be good Yeah Blake griffin could be good It's gonna be funny when dwade takes Pierce's job after he talked shit lol I feel like Blake would be bored by it Ooh I like the Blake idea I dunno I honestly could see wade as like a Hollywood guy But hes funny enough Jokic would be good Chris liley has a show on Netflix now and he did blackface again lmao Just like slightly less black Blakes gonna get a ring one day Lmfaoooo Hes gonna join someone good Later in his career He's joining Portland this summer space https://youtu.be/FapFfOZ64cE He is an Olshey guy What kinda pick would he fetch? A first His contract is so big The theory is Detroit tears it down and we give expirings, a young guy and a first Who knows what they're doing tho Lol duh a first Yeah but I dont think it has to be a lottery pick is what I mean Theres teams that could give them a way better deal Yeah At his price point, cap relief is a big deal But top 15 I mean it would be that and a prospect Some young player or two that the pistons like Like Simons Blake to the blazers? I was gonna make a trade suggestion but don't need spaces laughter calling me a homer lol Boban would be a great color guy Meyers, ET, simons or collins and our first for Blake? We gotta keep Kanter Were cutting Meyers after the season right? Make room for Skal Or Gary Trent Lmao no way Or some schmuck I heard sign to extension 10 million cap hit Is not worth cutting him NOOO Neils going to extend him before he bounces to the lakers FUCK STEPH CURRY Omg this could be an epic backdoor Wow Sowowowowowow Fuck you space That was too close Hahahaha Omg That was amazing lol God bless gambling That useless 30 seconds of basketball was like the nba finals Space Ill take Warriors from here on out They want the sweeep ?

Quickness!!!! Give the man some minutes!!!! Big 3 draft in 5 min!!!!! Micd up Meyers makes me glad Im watching at a bar with no volume You're kidding He's mic'd? Hes like the great job good effort kid Whats the ratio of good defense vs just missing shots in first half ET clearing out the paint to drive 12 feet and miss a jumper is the definition of his career And butter fingering the ball at half court like a 6th grader right before that Lmaoooo Western conference basketball! Sup mr nugget Freedom of offensive expression! ? Me nugget! Mr Whats the deal with Harkless? Blaze those nugz Harkless done?? It's layman time Questionable Why'd Kanter come out? He got cut Layman defense and rebounding is a thing It looks like Just need a little offense from him But more Collins He's coming back bloody nose for Kanter Maybe he had to take a shit #NAME? Wait dame got elbowed and they gave him a foul? He reached in with his face Chad theyre going to figure out what you did with the rim soon Yeah Chad do you forget to switch it at halftimes ? Oh no Holy shit Jokic has Sabas level vision 12 point lead doesnt feel safe Omg did Jokic just go through aminus legs for an and one 3 I put laxative in Millsaps Gatorade at halftime. Just give it 15 minutes It honestly goes:

Jokic
Walton
Sabonis For the greatest passing bigs in no particular order Divac 4th? Magic Johnson Wilt Ben Simmons So the whites? Cmon Gundy All the film room junkies can pass First ones in last ones out Lol Its the intangibles ^ grit 3 euros and bill Walton But Im talking 7 footers I dunno Sabonis in the nba is still more of a folk hero If your taking all time international hoops career I forgot Joakim Noah At his peak He was elite I respect Sabonis but I his best season he averaged 3 assists Averaged 2.1 for his career Dude all passing isnt in stats, look at Westbrook Wilt was the same way Just did it for the stats Not for the team Kevin Love padded his rebounds when he was on the timberwolves Never forget Yes hes great at outlets but Im not considering him as a goat Divacs averaged 5.6 one year In passing I agree But you gotta do better than that lol To be top 3 Fair Wowowow Also like again With all do respect Aminu hive That iteration of the blazers never exactly dominated Statistically the 2000 Blazers are one of the best teams of the millennium ^ Zero rings **but only one team wins a year** Like theyre right there with Steve Nashs Suns teams as the best to never get a ring Yeah fuck the lakers and those trash refs I dunno I guess most great teams got a title Who are the other contenders? Just suns and kings? Jazz Yeah Jizz Morris with the under 30 seconds points in the 3rd. It's like clock work ET has to claim that foul I mean post mj era Suns were wild They also changed basketball 7 seconds or less The lebron cavs ? Like early Lebron cavs? No they got worked wayyy too much Im getting Lulu Aladdin zales pendant for Mothers Day No doubt Some of those pacers teams Were raw thats some marketing! Take notes space Aladdin copped the lamp at Zales Diamonds in the rough? Arab women like it rough. Every kiss begins with K. ?????? Palestinian Chicken Capitol one sells coffee and Zales is marketing culturally appropriated Disney movies. #2019 The brands are trying! We gotta weather these non dame minutes Man That dribble by Zac Collins Thats the test to who has confidence Like a lot of dudes just go up believing they throw that down I wish masks were mandatory for safety precaution Sometimes they get embarrassed But the one dribble Snowflake legislation Is the worst Greg Oden drafted #7 overall by the aliens KD went #8 How do you charge your samsung when no one else has one? What a fall from grace having to play in a league that employs Oliver Maroney We are 30% from 3 There are only a finite number of Samsungs, once theyre all drained u throw it away and get a new one I mean I guess if youre on international blvd in Oakland maybe you can find someone outside a boost mobile Similar to how apple purposely kills old iPhones with iOS updates Wow turner great stuff Lol u guys are ahead of me so I was looking for turner to make
A great play lol I know it is a hot topic but these refs are trash NFL replacement refs were better That was huge Why is stotts dressed like hes in a six flags commercial Guys we just had a great in arena fight Between fans Cause this game is a roller coaster Dylan! We need to fucking rebound Two 40+ year olds. Blazers fan vs nuggets fan. Then the wives jumped in. Blazers wide threw a mean left hook Love the playoff intensity Jamario Moon goes #9 Poor Jokic on that one man Thats an out of shape miss We got lucky I hope The Rookie and The Intruder are in the same film universe I have a hard time believing the variance in officiating has been significantly better or worse over the last several years. The most notable difference is how vocal the star players have been. The Intruder better be good Its not Rengel ?? Plz god get a rebound Guys.... Rebounds This is insanity Rebounds? So god Hood* This is nuts Lillard lost his handles this game Thats a freaking foul Given that was a foul Its the altitude But still Lillard look tired or am I trippin? Im so sick of these players acting like every whistle is the worst call of all time I love Enes Kanter Animosity is high! Jokic shoves him lol Rodney Hood will knock a mother fucker out These racially ambiguous denver dudes need to chill ET suspended next game possibly, he camenoff bench God I hope ET came off the bench Fuckin Jokic should be gone On that shove Karma Is harkless's injury bad?? Whats the call? Cant hear Who knows Double tech Lmao Terrible call Denver ball Yikes Kanter cant inbound We lose this in ot So lets not go there fuckkkkkk Put turner in there before he gets suspended Thats our ball It's ours Lets gooooooo Dame makes free throws if he can get the ball He just missed one though They do some dumb shit where the announcer goes "who's ball?!" And the fans say "nuggets ball!"

So I yelled who's ball?! Hella loud after they switched the call and some drunk guy was like "nuggets ball?" The Micd Meyers Game! GrooOoOOooOooovy Baby yeahhhhh ? Wow SPLIT ON THE ROAD LETS GO Very important update: Steve Blake still not drafted in big 3 Later bitches see you in Portland ? https://twitter.com/royceyoung/status/1123792806424784896?s=21 ?

Hammer the Dame over next game https://twitter.com/davedeckard/status/1123800098255921152?s=21 Dave Deckard, real fun at parties Stay woke Schedule that tweet about dames 3 for 3 minutes from now Shaq shouting out his hooka shop haha Did we sign Crabbe to a 75 m deal? Or did Brooklyn match or something? We matches brookyn Brooklyn Im mid flight arguing with someone Okay but didnt he end up in Brooklyn? Yes We eventually traded him for cap relief it was a bad match So he signed a deal after that? They dump traded him We traded him for Andrew Nicholson's less shitty contract after 1 year Which we then stretched out over 5 years and is still on our cap til 2022 Thats right Im arguing with someone right now in favor of Neil, which is bad, but I feel like he still deserves SOME credit for where this team is Im curious I know we hate him in this chat And if no one feels that way, does any GM deserve credit in the NBA when their team is successful? Yes but dont know if Niel does with this team More credit to stotts and coaching staff I'll give Neil credit for the Hood and Kanter moves for sure Stotts gave the bench freedom tho Sitting dame and CJ at the same time was a low key big move for now Stotts has been incredible. He needs a raise and extension stat We can stagger them now but our bench feels good and confident now Okay but Im not bringing up now as much Was Neil or dame bigger in getting Kanter honestly? This is the first time weve had a real deep bench and defense is years. Its a new team Also Zach Collins His balls dropped tonight Just an absolute grown man game Could have been Dame dehaan. But I'm willing to give pussy ass olshey a win on that one lol Zach played great but still pissed about that draft Would've rather had JA and John Collins Well Donovan doesnt help us win lmao Love in the moment! Live* Lol true We've come along way from having to turn to Babbit and Claver off the bench during the Aldridge years! Haha ok fair Chad, just hate giving him credit! We literally had the worst bench in the league. Every starter played 35 minutes Lol dude believe me it hurt writing that ?? All the culture stuff about our team is 100% dame tho. Literally every guy we've brought in fucking loves him It could come full circle and get us AD this summer who knows! ?Look how Fucking disgusting that was lol Those days were so frustrating Also Batum was dope but hed just shit the bed some nights and fuck us Jared Jeffries tho Yeah Batum was the streakiest dude I've ever seen Nuggets were 25-57 in the paint. Thats crazy. Did they break a record for offensive boards though? Such a weird game I think they had 14 offensive boards in the 4th quarter alone Lol Insane ? ^ Eric Maynor Is that meyers leonards career arch if Danny ainge was our GM? Meyers isnt good enough to play in the big 3 but somehow has a second nba contract Meyers would be draining 4s https://www.instagram.com/p/Bw8oBg0pg1J/?igshid=dekf9rxf0qs0 This photo cracks me up https://www.instagram.com/p/Bw8n9M0Am7Y/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=5hsljwe22ivw Kanter giving no fucks post game He cant sleep cause of the shoulder pain so hes mad online to dull the pain https://www.instagram.com/p/Bw8mzE1AIB8/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=3n6ev5w3g4j3 Bold post after playing 0 minutes Lolol #leashed Enes Kanter will never stop going in Thats a weird way to spell DNP CD Mom made pizza rolls https://twitter.com/kriskoivisto/status/1123813249919725568?s=21 Rodney is a real one Were gonna need him Mark gimme toronto!

Gundy what's the word on the street https://twitter.com/msinger/status/1123988712134729728?s=21 He said it was a bad roll And he didnt commit to playing on Game 3 Fork God dammit So Layman getting the start? .. ZC Give the man some minutes That makes the most sense, I think terry likes Hood off the bench more than as a starter Layman had a killer month during the regular season starting. He's ready We need a wing Cam Nah This is so weird to have wing depth That keeps the rest of the rotations as in tact as possible Im all in on ZC no matter what the costs If we start ZC who comes off the bench when Kanter comes out? You're giving us major Meyers minutes with that move lol Alright fine We only have two playable big men right now and one only as 1 shoulder Clearly blinded by love I'm loving ZC too but give him 25 minutes off the bench If he can stay out of foul trouble ZC is also 7 foot Cam Tbh Meaning? Means he has a huge hog You guys kinda look the same? Layman can D up Craig. Aminu stays on Milsap ? Makes me look like a shrimp You guys honestly look like brothers lmao Im much more handsome but he for sure has a bigger dick Shoutout to you for the two new followers Slowly building my following of porn stars from asia Also boys ill be in town Friday-Sunday what time do you land Friday is a Brondezvous in order? 9:15 Am or pm pm SHIT Are you flying on an airline with television Yeah man im not happy about that Dont think I will be able to get tnt unforch might pay for internet to stream it Man I hope you can Pray for me bros Ts & Ps Danny Ainge had a mild heart attack?

My nets fan buddy's response to the DeAngelo news lol BK is short for woke Man I cant believe people like that shit lol McHale was raving about the 2 cookies in the real meal Why is McHale calling playoff games? He's worse than mike rice Hes just a relentless blazers hater I dont get it I get it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mejFtEY5faU He also said Torrey Frank last night. Like wtf Fucking Embiid Christ Whats the score Im flying Philly up 15 midway 3rd quarter Man lol T mobile is running that mariners ad nationally Kawhi is such a monster Wow fuck Spicy P for that bush league shit Wut lol he got hammered for no reason Thats fucking bullshit Theres no room for that crap That was not okay Like come on Omg this is so wack Embiid gets away with murder You dont kick a guy like that That doesnt make what Pascal did okay! Lol blazers fans are very sensitive about lower leg injuries a hard basketball foul is one thing But intentionally trying to chop a guy down is disgraceful Yeah maybe we are Lol Especially on bigs Yeah I know lol Theyre getting their asses kicked and he lost his cool Its bringing back old trauma Thats what happened lol I dont want to watch a series thats missing one of its two best players Yes but this is avoidable you know? It wasnt that violent he swung his leg out, draymond does that 9 times a game Yeah and Draymond should be ejected for it Whats your point My point is that you guys are particularly sensitive toward this bc of bad past experiences What pascal did was wrong and deserves a flagrant And he got appropriately punished for it lol nah what exactly are you referring to Cause I cant think of anything similar in blazers games besides when that cocksucker Trevor ariza tried to end Rudy Fernandez Past experiences or the play? Past experiences Oh I mean big men suffering career ending leg injuries Moose is in the game now thats a pretty loose connection No its not lol Im talking about players intentionally trying to take each other down youre talking about guys getting hurt in the run of play I would be just as pissed at pascal if he tried to chop down JJ redick I mean you wouldnt care as much about a cheap shot in another bodily region Pascals play was very extra every NBA player has legs.... I dont get your point Your more upset cuz he hit him in the leg than you are that he hit him Yeah because its dangerous to take somebodys legs out Its a vulnerable part of a player regardless of what position they play Dude you absolutely get my point I see the connection youre trying to make but its lazy and doesnt work No its not lol You can disagree with it Fine Lol its lazy bro Try again Wut? Since were in the demanding explanations mood Do better. Youre smarter than that. Why is it lazy? Because youre relying on a tired theme that blazers fans are still haunted by injuries to sam bowie and greg oden Dude you literally bounced from the group chat bc of jokes about (not mine) leg injuries. To say your sensitive toward leg injuries is basically an observation at this point And you werent wrong to be upset! And trying to draw a connection to this dirty play by siakam because sam bowie and greg oden are big guys with legs and so is Joel Embiid To suggest that someone who watched a player they care about snap his leg in half Might be more sensitive toward a wreck less flagrant targeting a leg Is not a long walk Its fine if you disagree But its not an insane tale at all Lol blazers fans are very sensitive about lower leg injuries It has nothing to do with being a blazers fan And it has nothing to do with legs specifically, this just coincidentally happens to be him swinging at legs. My point is and will continue to be that any cheap shot by any player directed at any body part of another is disgusting and players should automatically be disqualified for such behavior Has nothing to do with blazers fans being particularly conditioned by it If he made that exact same contact with another region of his body, you would have been equally upset? Yes because its disgusting and theres no place in basketball for that every year I have kids on my team that take a cheap shot at kids on other teams because they get frustrated were losing and think theyre being singled out by referees (they watch too much nba) My man you dont get to put a word I didnt use in quotes im not quoting it to suggest you used it or didnt use Thats quotation because I have lack of ab better word But the second one of my kids pulls that shit they are removed from the game and they dont get to participate the rest of the tournament Embiid!!!! Windmill!!! Well in that case we have a different understanding of quotation marks! Because they need to learn that there are consequences for intentionally trying to hurt somebody Consider them finger quotes It doesnt need them lol you picked the right word Ok good ? Look Im not trying to get kicked out of the superliga but its not an outrageous tale at all Hopefully somebody on the raptors coaching staff pulls pascal aside and explains to him why that was wrong Since the referees werent willing to eject him You get bit by a dog, your more nervous around dogs. It doesnt mean dogs are more dangerous or that you should take the threat of dogs more seriously then you already do. It means your more aware of the seriousness of a dog attack. Maybe you become over cautious around dogs!? I dunno maybe not But thats the take And its reasonable If the dog in this scenario is serious injuries, I get it. But I think you were suggesting the dog was wearing a blazers jersey and thats silly because dogs shouldnt wear human clothes. Did I get this analogy right? It is true You can never trust a dog that wears clothes Ok so we agree then That dog would rip your dick off and its owner would blame you and give it a treat No more clothed dogs Score? Ian 1000000 
Dubov -457687 Lol Im kidding Dubov ?"The sixers are now setup for some sex on Thursday" Damn is toronto gonna be ok?

Meyers Leonard Meyers would probably say drop his butt He better be nicer to Enes or else Rodney is going to get upset and maybe try and punch him or something. - Meyers You guys Maybe its my morning wake and bake But I cant stop seeing the parallels between the 2019 Blazers and Sixers and the 1977 versions of them The sixers are the more talented mercenary team Blazers are the better TEAM ? I like that take Dr J aint walking through that door I mean unless he has tickets to the game of course I want Milwaukee and Portland but I understand if no one will give me worth and Portland Superliga Saturday?

Tbh Barr was being a chicken tho lol Of course he was https://twitter.com/nbcnews/status/1124361149997375489?s=21 Lol wait what But eating a bucket of KFC during a congressional hearing as a joke doesnt help anything It's like the Tyreek Hill texts but from our president and a dictator The trump tweets about that call are hilarious. He got updated orders from his daddy. When do the piss tapes come out Gundy explain this boylen situation to me I thought all the players hated him Yeah same Was he just the cheapest coach on the market? But then they started liking him lol They ended the season all kinds being okay with each other and I think the bulls dont really care So bizarre Also hes cheap For sure Who gets fired first. Boylen or Monty? PHX will lose 5 in a row in November and Sarver will get the itch Bulls just a piggie bank for the White Sox https://twitter.com/yourmandevine/status/1124114453509943298?s=21 Is FVF bad now? FVV**** Always thought it was Fred van Fleet lol Whoa Me too dude Thats cray ? Fuck it Mark I want Milwaukee! BUCKS FOR CUCKS You have to take Milwaukee That was the agreement ? Space you got rockets and bucks No fuck that Im not taking that rockets line Yes, yes you are No man Im sorry I cant believe that line exists I think Im gonna be sick Just looking at that Jokic over 24.5 is +110. Am I crazy to think thats a lock? Fine If everyone isnt betting warriors youre a dummy https://twitter.com/suns_reddit/status/1124346500048457729?s=12 Do I still get the bucks? Yes 2.5 Nice ? I dont know for sure but Im fairly certain Zach Collins is rewatching film from last game and he referred to Jokic as filet mignon Is that supposed to be a diss? Sounds more like a compliment It is but it still means Zach is eating Hes eating very fine and expensive cut of meat Oh lol Thats pretty uh, not self aware lol considering Jokic scores like 37 in game one Hes taking about Jokic on defense tho And Zac Collins has never ate in his career lol I know I mean he didnt say it publicly Yeah and Im not gonna do that to him but I thought it was funny But come on, he dominated game one and game 2 was a defensive slugfest Hahaha you should And then text terry Moe available Terry literally said that it was such a weird flex by Woj Lol lol Lol ESPN trying to mute the crowd noise is hilarious This game is spiraling Jaylen picking up 5 is tough Whats wrong with the Celtics!? Let us ask our good friend Gundy Lmao theyre bad And I bet them Patty fastball in eastern conference finals proves were in a simulation with Elon musk Im disappointed in Kyrie https://twitter.com/thekidmero/status/1124501701225058305?s=12 wow gundy you gonna let mero call you out like that? Smh Where did we land on Brooke Lopez being elite? Can this game just end and get us to the main card Boys you will be happy to know your boy gets the game on his flight! Or maybe you dont give a shit. Regardless Im stoked. The basketball gods are smiling upon you Cameron I had a sucky ass day at work so I just popped a gummy and settled in to watch my boy Dame dismantle these chicken nuggets Why are they fouling A timeout?! This is absurd haha The ticker said ESPN2 but its 30 for 30 ? S/O the good luck quart Omg another foul This 4th quarter has taken 50 minutes Its on espn 2... You can watch Portland in the Espn app rn Oh shit okay I'm dumb Kanter already torched his shoulder Goddamnit on YouTube tv ESPN2 never picked it up Fuck finally there it goes Daniel Craig with the mask God bless espn for giving us the best broadcast duo for this one I need 28 outta Lillard Same Jesus espn you gotta warn me when youre gonna get away from the deuce to sports center Millsap getting away with first degree murder on Moe God I love Kanter I love when we get points in the paint ?I put a good fortune in for the zers Dame feasting on long twos Harkless has had a couple really bad post ups against Murray Going from McHale to DB is our biggest upgrade since swapping Felton for Lillard Collins has had an absolutely horrendous stretch This series has been sloppy joes Gimme another 15 from Hood How do we keep getting beat on Dbounds? Seth has to claim that foul for ZC I love dame God you gotta love your first team guard diving on the floor I love guys that sell out for their team Its the first quarter of a non deciding game and hes laying out Passion. Passion. Passion. Bad news, Denver swarming dame forcing him to pass 4 assists in the first. Let them try to stop him. Mike Malone wanted Portland to feel him? Creep. Omg if CJ hit that harden step back the lid woulda blew off the that place Almost jumped out of my middle seat on this tin can jet Wow. Middle seat. I admire the sacrifices youre willing to make for your blazers. Gf got automatically upgraded so had to swindle some delta comfort plus upgrade styles so legroom is luckily in abundance. Shaquem Griffin in the building. He was on campus today doing some workouts with kids. Sidebar: regional MMA fights next Saturday at the rose land Anybody wanna go full white trash? Mark Ive always wondered this. How the hell do they do fights in the roseland? Whats the seating configuration? No but would love if your blood lust having ass stumbled into a bar I am drinking at after. Im here for the violence I dont care what the configuration is, its gonna be wild I saw minor league mma there in like 2006 and there isnt a bad seat in the house. Forget the technical term But like is the ring in the middle? Is it SRO? Balcony is $39 Floor is $39 Then ga $29 It was a little offset when I was there Balcony had the bar though So weird I havent been to the rose land since the chainsmokers in like 20012 Wtf was that fast break 2012 ? Sloppy joes This KFC makes me want to get a bucket of chicken and watch Dirty Dancing. *kfc ad No it doesnt Or maybe its this marijuana that makes me want that We talk a lot about the death of the true center But what about the death of the true point guard? Positionless basketball Ian Lol I guess when you think about it Pg and c meter were the only real positions Hood the X Though I dunno I think its coming back Why we settling those garbage 3s? Ian basketball positions are like fashion. Its all cyclical. Pretty soon we will find ourselves in the big 3 era again PF's were real too. Had two dudes in the paint at all times Gundy honest question Not trying to rub it in The PF position always perplexed me honestly. I feel like that position is the reason centers have slowly been phased out. More production. What is your stance on mil Boston now? Yeah fair chad but I would say there were always kinda flex forwards I think the guy on the block And the guy bringing the ball ip Eh idk man in the 90's and early two thousands you still at 4's who couldn't shoot outside 10 feet It was definitely a defined position If they dont win Game 4 its obviously over, but they just need to win and pressure is back on the Bucks to win Game 5 at home Lol you had 3s that couldnt shoot outside 10 feet Giannis was great tonight Boston bench also was a no-show tonight Hes great a lot to be fair I think Boston still has a chance I respect what youre saying chad the Anthony masons of the world But I feel less good about it now. That was a big boy win by the bucks But I still think the role of the pg and the center were more specialized I think its hard to accept the fact The the bucks are the next mini dynasty Durant gone Giannis the best in the league Man I want to jump on the Suns over next season cause of Monty and their young talent but they still have a sarver problem so I know it wont happen What is up with Lillards handles lately? Losing balls on drives he usually dominates. Yeah Mason, Horace grant, Charles Oakley. All those dudes. I guess I'm just saying that was a specialized role. There was no way in hell you'd call that guy a 3, and they were too small at the time to be a 5 Fucking murray But it's interesting that in the early 2000's those muscle bound 4's actually became 5's cuz teams had no answer for Shaq Suns changes the game Im excited for Dames huge 3Q Amare I know but look
At the good ones? Malone duncan Lets just knock this bet out early with a 20 pt 3rd for dame All those guys could handle the ball Well actually Jamal Murray has a similar game to CJ really but hes just better cause hes athletic I dunno To be a true 4 you have to be slow For sure but those were the unicorns. I'm just saying that jacked 6'8 dude that could bang the boards, protect the center, and make a 10 foot turnaround was a very specific role On every team in the old days* like millsap is a true 4 Jamal is ballin Jamallin Robert Traylor was a 4. Nobody else ever was a 4. I love how ESPN is trying to emulate the TNT crew This is terrible Besides jalen this is absolute trash RIP ESPN Pierce is so bad. And now they're just ripping him trying to make him some lovable idiot ala Charles and it'll never happen Murray is slaughtering us Is Lillard going to show up this half?? I never seen a 7foot 400lb point guard That was a fucking dime from Jokic Hes like Jared Lorenzen Hes probably a better pitcher than Pat Jokic would fucking dominate the Dr Pepper Tuition Giveaway halftime contest Terrible call Were def gonna need dame in this one Flop Shouldve been a no call wtf PREACH DORIS Offensive! He chicken winged em Kanter! Looking like a young mehmet okur Penis! KANTER THE GAWD! I love Kanter and I love how much he loves Portland What time does everyone got? Cant tell if Im behind LOL at Gary Harris stepping in and squeaking his shoes during CJs FT Fucking aminu Dames has had zero off ball movement in the 3rd This is the first time in awhile Ive felt comfortable with our secondary coming in Im buying a ZC Jersey after this series Dame is 0-1 in 3Q How many assists? Hey Ian was that Nissan kicks commercial yours? 5 total He had the one to ZC for 3 I feel like an actual playoff team with our bench Oh. Nvm. 10/5/2005 Fuck What would Nurk even do?? This is wild Collins not having 2 in the third is a blessing Lol he just picked that one up He has 3 Wtf How you gonna call that on Rodney?? I dont like when we have a decent lead but the fans focus on the refs Need to be front runners That was a hook Damn Doris is sexy when she's breaking down a perfect close out Short choppy steps get me hard Damn Doris is sexy. Couldve stopped there Superliga gang bangs Doris would be a fantastic film The Gang Does Doris ? Its always rainy in Portland starring the superliga would be greenlit immediately ???? Bukaki Burke has a nice ring to it Wow mark NSFW When does Lillard come back in? 10 min? God Curry is fucking killing us No offense and shitty defense Adam silver and his back problems in the house! Evan turner is dead weight Why cant he get injured with meyers Meyers inured? Dame needs to come in with 8 left Hes coming in after the timeout right Wheres dame Right Too long of a break Put him in asap Jokic has played the entire 4th. Gonna be gassed at the end Stop leaving him open! Fuck Agreed Hes slow why are we not bodying him up top? I feel like jokic is if we got sabonis when he was 25 Low key Curry needs to sit down for the love of god Curry again Why do we have 3 small guards in The thrill This is stupid put in chief Chief or Hood We need defense Wtf is terry doing Jokic night pass out I actually would rather have Hood than moe Kanter is a soldier What are these touch fouls I feel like he is a ball of pain at this point I hate when CJ tries to be dame In his defense when dame isnt being dame someone needs to try Refs are fucking us right now tbh CJ not even looking up https://twitter.com/omaroneynba/status/1124534073609805824?s=21 During the break I bring you more Maroney "he's a great guy" content Im gonna ask again. What happened to Dames handles? Denver has better hands than OKC Lillard hurt or tired? Tired They are also forcing it out of his hands every time Here comes the natural cocaine The heart is racing RTPK in the house ?? Gotta go 2 for 1 Two for one lfg ??????

Omg Yikes Dame dame dame You have to shoot that Nuggets fucked up You're in the paint Yea Not chief Dame That just made zero sense Yeah they did What the fuck But Jesus how physical can you be 45 feet away? Two hands on is auto foul Agreed Refs don't have the balls to call that tho THE OVER IS BACK IN PLAY Jokic Obesity factor has gotta come into play here We can only hope.

They look a lot worse than they are, usually clear up in 5-15 days and usually of little consequence. There can be rare exceptions eg if there is extreme bleeding or becomes infected. In 40 years I never saw one get infected(eg from a dirty fingernail that caused the tear/rip that caused the bleed). I maybe saw a couple extreme bleeds which responded to lots artificial tears and lots of eye ointment.(Google corneal dellen)" ?That's the photo I sent him Lol this happened to Matt Hanna after he wrestled Neil Callahan at sun river Mark u smoking any meats today ? Was that before or after you were ringing vodka out of a sponge and chasing with mustard? Essentially that scenario is when Space earned his bid.

Nuggets fans getting a little cocky. Can't wait to end this in 6 Lillard, Jokic, Durant, Kawhi So many heroic performances this year Harden putting one on Lou fucking Williams! God after Durant leaves and the warriors become a 6 seed and stephs legacy slowly erodes Cant wait! The west woulda been even more fun if like Durant went to Dallas instead of GS a few years ago. And you basically have just 7 awesome teams and anyone could win every year. Or just stayed in okc Tbh Yeah true But they got PG Hes not Durant! I wouldnt have wanted them to be TOO GOOD tho lol Rockets gonna win The series Blazers best the rockets (in 4) Harden is ridiculous They better mention Sam Prestis ineptness in every article thats about to come out praising Daryl Morey Mark this is revenge for last year lol I dunno man I really think the bux are the best team Mirotic has been so key The war of attrition favors Giannis https://twitter.com/nhlgifs/status/1125591177091268608?s=12 can this dog do basketball? we need a McHale replacement. https://twitter.com/stevejones20/status/1125592906075725824?s=21 Is this the Snappers son?

When the Sonics were drafting the Westbrook year Yes we were still the Sonics At that point I wanted Gordon Over Westbrook Im being vindicated! To prestis credit lol The conventional wisdom from the media Was What a career rejuvenation too. He was toast on the pelicans. I thought the knee injuries doomed him Jarred Bayless That summer Houston gave him 4/48 and Ryan Anderson 4/80 lmao should've been the other way around Better poster? Paul robbing draymond from behind or Steph missing a dunk? This goes to OT GS takes it New York Knicks ! Lillard would have hit that Two good looks Bitches! An unbelievable first look for Durant Opening lines:

Toronto -6 
Denver -4.5 Any gamblers? Ill take the zers Idk what the met gala actually is but it looks like Illuminati Coachella ^ best quote in years ?Lol Ouch Hahah Damn my homie definitely probably wrote that copy too lmao Just horrible timing lol dope collaboration tho Yeah timing was not great I would argue that there have been rumblings off his unhappiness in Boston for awhile though Oh for sure. It's all coming to a head now tho Could have played his last home game as a Celtic Probably should have forewent the whole kit Yeah Game 1 was the time to fire off that tweet lol Yeah he looked a lot like lebron did his last game in Cleveland LaMarcus too For real - except Kyrie hasnt come out and said he loves Portland and wants to stay like LA did That fuck Actually Kyrie did lmao Oh I stand corrected then Ill stay if youll have me At a fan event To me Kyrie did it worse lmao Meh one could easily twist that in to a front office situation But yeah that is not a good look Speaking of that fuck LA - what are the chances we get him this offseason? Lets just say I was told LaMarcus wasnt exactly forthcoming with his guarantee in 2014 That was Neils idea Elaborate for me please We need a big man! Weve always needed a big man Neil tried to get LaMarcus to sign an extension but it was after 0.9 and Neil wanted to keep us good vibes going so he called The Oregonian to give them the story about how LaMarcus wants to be the best blazer of all time Ah - got it. Thank you for that Chris Haynes was pissed he didnt get the story and he hits up LA to see why he didnt get it, LA tells Haynes Neil made him talk to the Oregonian Also love that we can just call it the 0.9 So its all up to how much we believe LA vs. believing Neil and I believe LA lol Do we call this years the 1.5 then? God theres so many good names for this one The wave The last word I mean from what I gather LA was a bit of a bitch regardless so it is hard to pick a side You think it will go down in history for the Thunder as the Logo Loss? I like bad shot ?This sums up our fortunes perfectly Step it up boys! Also dame hitting his 3s would be dope Hes getting fewer looks but hes gotta cash them Dame is shooting 26 percent On 3s Like thats the difference of 3 or 4 He gets just a few more to go and that changes everything Yeah - Dame is still putting up solid numbers but his percentage is waaaay down from what we were seeing in the OKC series He looks off out there. Curious if something is going on behind the scenes we arent privy to I think hes healthy, I just think the nuggets play better defense than OKC As a team And maybe guarding Murray is taking more out of him than guarding Russ He has looked a lot better on D these playoffs Yeah Harris has been in his grill like crazy. He's had less space to operate But he also missed a shit ton of open jumpers in game 4 These are tough lines today Also its not just Harris. When he crosses halfcourt hes got Harris and another guy shading him OKC was lazy with the details Great point I think he's gotta enforce his will early on in game 5. Denver isn't scared of him right now Well if youre feeling confident... Im thinking Im gonna take Denver tonight No officially in Tough spread 4.5 Yeah also him hitting the 1.5 showed his ridiculous range - even moreso than the shots he was making beforehand. Denver is def bodying him way earlier now so hopefully we can figure out how to combat that or Aminu + Harkless can make more than 4 3s in 4 games. I think we're due for an Aminu 6-9 3pt FG game Yes please The pendulums gotta swing the other way Or another Curry cook sesh Listening to 107.5 - Meyers introduces the next song. Only fitting its Wannabe a Baller Yeah Aminu and Harkless need to get some good shots I have a good feeling about tonight This team is just steely as fuck I will never count them out until theyre out I feel like Denver is a little overconfident too Or maybe just their fan base but I put that on the team too lol Denver fans suck Yeah! Chad you suck! As a new Coloradan I feel pretty ashamed. I hoped they'd be the just happy to be here type fans (Are we piling on?) They're already pretty insufferable And they dont even really care lmao Yeah they sound like a bunch of kooks Yeah man that stadium was pretty empty when I was there game 2 It's definitely a hockey / football town That part honestly shocked me Its not like theyre always in the playoffs and theres fatigue You'd think a number 2 seed after years of suffering would get people hard If tickets drop to 30 again tonight I may have to pull up We won last time I was there Do it for la liga Para la liga as they say Maybe we should all get that tattooed Let's do it What would Conor Ryan do Just got the Hulu has Live Sports one but I could get another Fill the sleeve, Rengel. https://twitter.com/chold/status/1125809881791942656?s=21 Low key flex having The Dreams number https://twitter.com/royceyoung/status/1125818222911971328?s=21 What an interesting angle to follow Wait you can't drink water either can you?

Can't wait to run it back 2019 stylez ? https://twitter.com/enes_kanter/status/1125886589270396928?s=21 Class act Kanter Jalen and jacoby both said boogie should stay with the warriors one more year That would be so incredibly lucky for them if that happened #NurkBetter Warriors have caught so many breaks already. Stephs ankles contract, cap spike for KD, boogie Achilles Tanking for Harrison Barnes on the last day of the season Beast coast! Lol notice the stage design for the encore ? Says el dedo Can we please get rid of McHale smh Regardless, let's fuck go boys Seriously why do we keep getting McHale lol Lets gooooo I have a feeling dames going to find his shot again tonight Not a fan of the black jerseys tho Shoulda went rip city Great start! Also were like 0-3 in playoffs wearing black jerseys just sayin Inshallah All these cross matches on D are gonna cause problems on the other end Exhibit A; last play I just blazed some nugs to get us back in it CJ looking like a traffic cone on transition D God Kanter fucked my bitch Would have really loved if Dame had gotten up and gotten back on defense instead of looking at the ref I'm kinda intrigued with Aminu on Jokic. I was against it at first but he's got a block already Jesus Christ Wow Four blazers in the paint and Craig gets the board I take it back. Yes! Five blazers in the paint. Yes! Thats what we need Hey there it is dame! Free throwsssss Wtf is wrong with dame at the line! Lets go! Fucking pisses me off I finally didnt bet the dame over so you know hes gonna get it Chief Weather the storm!!! Make the freebies FREEEEEE 92% during the regular season cmon dawg ? What Gary Harris did in transition is a foul. Its not two hands but if you put your forearm into a guy in transition to divert him thats creating a disadvantage Harkless looking soft tonight If dame shot his season percentage this series wed be down 2 and up 3-1 in the series Oh you mean every night but like 1 quarter? Why is hood not starting the dude has earned it He plays defense too terry! Harkless is like a moody ex gf. You always remember the good times and then every time you get your hopes up, you realize how much she sucks Yeah after we cum we realize Mo sucks Moe is better with dame and CJ cause of offensive rebounds imo Yeah I get the rebounding gunz Except for he hasnt been Moe should be able to post up scrawny ass Murray every play But Id take the corners threes over offensive boards tbhe But he doesn't Fair Let's go chief Little chair pull there Wow jokic lucky These are the up and coming teams in the western conference - McHale about the 2nd and 3rd seed Hood gotta sacrifice the body there HOOODDDD Red Hot Rodney Hood! My boi Our new found son Rodney hood can fuck my bitch Millsap is so solid Such a savvy vet 2 on Murray lets go The ghost of the millsap offer sheet haunting blazer fans to this day We could use him real talk I like that rodney is picking up Murray ? court Als offensive game makes me want to vomit I like that Rodney is so good Hood* both are correct Is Rodney the most hood duke player ever? I feel like Rodney belongs on the 03 pistons Wow great call Dylan like him an Ben Wallace would just play dice on the plane ? Hes like putting peak tayshaun prince in a time machine Wow good comp there Who had the higher ugly to good ratio? Tayshaun or andrei kirelinko Tuff call I know the better ugly bad ratio was darko milicic Z eazy! Fuck yes Zach fillet mignon I love ZC too If hes our 8th best player we can fuck Plumlee is such a cuck Playoff foul by ZC Just imagine Collins and kanter behind a healthy Nurk And then AD at the 4 when we trade for him AD would be so perfect for us And Dame has called him by name every time he's asked who he'd like to play with Like blazers v warriors with no KD and if we had AD would be a beautiful series. Two on Jokic! Jokic has never committed a foul in his life according to Jokic We gotta go on a run here ? Chris Paul agrees These chips are legit by the way That foul on kanter happened so fast! Cut it to 2 by the end of the quarter hes getting eaten alive out there playing hungry Lillard going downhill every time please Questionable non foul call there Seth not getting respect How is that not a foul there on seth Wow that was literally what I was talking about Removed an exclamation from How is that not a foul there on seth Im jaded Not shocked at all If you take an offensive player off his course that is a violation Fucking donahue mafia Blazers need to be attacking the hoop downhill every time Its been working every game and the nuggets have no idea how to stop it Refs choked on their whistles there not wanting to call a foul on a half court heave I know the nuggets have scored I like our defensive strategy Stick Aminu on Jokic and dont double Let's ride with that No more east 3s Easy Jokic has to sit for at least the first 3 minutes. We gotta have the lease before he comes back in Lead Omg Zach Dude Fuck Get turner out Cross court pass at ZCs feet in the corner is dumb Thats not ZCs fault Wow This second unit gives me cold sweats Denver is moving the ball and were going 1 on 1 and wasting valuable possessions Hits your hands shoulda caught it As my coach always said Dude you cant throw a fastball at a 7 footers feet and expect him to go down to catch it Turner is Fucking trash Get him out 3 of 19 in the playoffs! Jesus That was a quick whistle on ET tho If we have to double every post up they're gonna get open 3s all night If theyre gonna keep playing 1 on 1 Im turning the tv off Turner should get waived His PER is prolly -42 Dame back in? Did terry think there were only 4 minutes left in the 2nd? So Jokic sits and the nuggets go +4 Lets go That's not gonna get it done Get a bucket here Pressure is back on LFG Zach needs to stop talking to the refs Yeah chill out young fella Omg Enes needs to eat something Foul! What the fuck Jesus how is that not a foul on Jokic Refs clearly didn't call it cuz they knew he had 2 Shouldve been 3 on jokic but Ill take the outcome That's such bs Omg Fuck dame Wtf is going on Id almost rather have the foul? Two four point plays he's whiffed this is ridiculous We should be down 3! It's all mental Yips Fucking black jerseys Be more like murray We can't win this game if Murray outplays dame 4 on Plumlee lol 3 Dame asking for the shot when he clearly passed lol Oops Dame needs to queue takeover very soon It time Good pass God give me a 3rd on Jokic Make up call Also kanters fast ended a half hour before tip He apparently had a PB and J He's gonna bull over Aminu in the post and get an offensive God bless America Hold the pb just give me the j Was it an uncrustable If you have to ask you cant afford it So they call that on Kanter but not a hip check to the deck on Jokic I believe in Christ James Fuck off Travel!! Are you kidding me Fucking Muslims Murray is a bum Dame pulled the chair that was ridiculous Aminu + Harkless gotta make more than 1 three a game Fuck Trouble Not like this No heart This is the danger zone God dammit We look like we have given up already ? Why are we playing like were the same team from 2017 Guys were still tired from game 3 its ok If dame makes a pair we're winning Murray is such a bitch Omg another miss Welp were ducked Nice dame Welp Playoff hockey is on See you Thursday Bye Ugh It bugs me that guys can take 2 steps into a jumper like that now That's a travel And Hood is hurt I used to always get called for that haha Great Game 6 prices down 10% And boxing out on the shooter Drink every time they mention Lillard and free throws Drink every time Lillard makes a free throw. You'll be dead sober This shitty quarter was with jokic not doing much either Alright 18 is fucked But better than 20 Its the NBA in 2019 18 is more like 12 when we were kids Sorry guys this is on me. I shoulda been there Did CJ miss the plane ride? Not even gonna open a familiar for the second half I drank my first familiar tonight maybe thats whats fucking you Mark if we get it to single digits pop that bottle What did you do with you ticket(s) Chad? I am gonna finish the one I have open But no more until the blazers hold up their end https://twitter.com/reallifekaz/status/1125967906104279041?s=21 ^ good tweet Anthony Bennett has joined the chat I didn't pull the trigger space.

How is that not continuation Wow Harkless got fucked That's what I thought Bitches Okay they called it Kris Jesus Hey guys Harkless and Aminu still aren't making 3's Paging Zach Lowe Ugh Im still watching Taylor Rooks IG story whats happening? Could Ed Davis have been the X factor on Millsap this series? ?? Might have been worth the 4 milly Goddamnit Olshey playing checkers while everyone else is playing chess Olshey meanwhile is bragging about our average age (while signing 3 18 year olds to sit on the bench) As bad as swanigan was, he might have even helped on Milsap We need some beef Lets start a fight https://open.spotify.com/track/3vBv2Tp0kHyBDUBZJr9GXQ?si=YPzkOlKCQiWqxnNb31ABZA Aminu 3 we back baby!! ? Going down swigging ? Damn mark, are you glad you didnt give me raptors and nuggets? IT gonna put 20 on ya in the 4th Honestly I'd rather lose this way than by 2 We're gonna win 6 then game 7 is a coin flip Just tuned back in. What did I miss? Looks like not a whole lot Yeah except when you lose by two you get to watch 47.5 riveting mins of basketball Very true Ian Millsap dominated I didnt bet the dame over Idiot. I dunno Im with you regarding the anguish But I always feel so empty when I wait 3 days for a game and then it sucks This must be what its like to watch the heat every game Last 7 minutes is gonna be Simons vs IT iso's Lol the heat are such a. Weird team to root for That's an odd way to spell shitty Meyers sighting Meyers in. You know its bad Honestly dont think its a coincidence McHale has been on the call the last two games McHale has called every game except the 4OT one hasn't he Fuck kevin mchale Did Zach just get a foul for executing a box out? Great shot meyers Dubov I thought the same thing Im out guy. Gonna jerk it to Taylor rooks YouTube videos then fall asleep in my tears and cum on the couch Literally just boxed him out Get dame out Fuck. Off. Meyers. Look at the bright side. Nobody on the east coast is watching us anyway If youre gonna brick a three you sure as shit better be the first motherfucker back on defense If youre gonna brick a three your house pet better still be living Hahahaha If we win game 6 I will fly to Denver Game 7 pre game at my house If we win game 6 I will watch game 7 Lets buy tickets Chad Man I would really, really, REALLY love Jokic as a player if he wasnt so lazy and didnt complain so much Down We need to step up Like he would be up there with Giannis and Luka as my favorites Idk if we can Also Ive been told Dame is sick Dubov loves guys with soccer names Pray it wears off soon Dame needs to suck it up. It's 79 and sunny in Portland who gets sick lmao Meyers just got sent 5 feet backwards by Barton Man is it just gonna be 1 vs 2 and 1 vs 2 again? White boy three bombs Lets go! Getting us back in it Put Layman in! Ivory towers No Ian we're gonna win duh He hasnt been inside the three point line. - one guy I hate talking about another guy I hate Im honestly so confused why layman hasnt gotten minutes this series. It seems like terry didnt care about shortening the rotation so why not give him a chance? Lets get it to 12 with 6 minutes left McHale is so bored hes talking about hockey Yeah Layman gives us more than ET tbh God I hope we win this game by a bucket and that missed goaltend is why I stopped watching Its bad luck if I start again right Ill take one for the team boys I will publicly retract everything I have ever said about Meyers Leonard if he gets in a fight with Jokic resulting in suspensions Wow great idea Gundy 12 at 6 is still in play Oh boy! Oh hell yes! Meyers Leonard lmaoooo SPEAK IT INTO EXISTENCE You called it haha Dubov say the blazers win by 2 now The blazers are gonna win this game by 2 Gotta love Zach always being down to mix it up Lmao how long are they gonna review this You fucking kidding me Omg the nba is so soft Vulnerable airborne player? Jokic has never been airborne Finally found something softer than Meyers Leonard and its name is Nba At least the nba doesn't have a dead dog tho Simons time Qyntel Woods begs to differ Hahahahaha Great reference Wtf is Malone doing with Jokic and Harris still in https://twitter.com/btrowland/status/1125987840293244928?s=21 When did we turn into the 2009 Memphis tourney team Brett brown gotta go This is fucking embarrassing You really gonna let dudes launch corner threes on you up 25 with a minute left? Meanwhile the announcers are talking about this being the end of the road or them lmao wtf God I wish Nurkic could have been in this battle with us ? Mike Malone > brad Stevens Denver talking about how they haven't been to the WCF since '09. Try 19 years for us poor fans. We need it https://twitter.com/trailblazers/status/1125990429625729025?s=12 Woof Lowe was right. We live and die by how well Aminu and Harkless shoot. We need a 3 point threat in the front court next year https://twitter.com/milescustis/status/1125989510804721664?s=12 Blazers in 7 Jalen rose thinks AD is gonna go to Phoenix to reunite with Monty Williams. I like the idea but he proposed the #1 pick, Josh Jackson AND Ayton No way New Orleans fetches that much with AD basically on a 1 year contract right? Lol I mean if youre the Suns I would still do it I dont lol I mean I get it But weve seen what a team with Anthony Davis and no one else can do And theyre immediately like a 6 seed And stuck there Devin Booker is good tho I dont know if I think that But that team doesnt compete without a third guy Most of the best teams have built through the draft Fair Phoenix has built through the draft for years lmao If it were the number one pick OR Ayton Id say hell yeah Completely bottoming out is overrated Also New Orleans is insane if they turn down the number one pick at all How much better can they really do? I always forget how young Anthony Davis is But I still feel like a super young core of Zion, Ayton, Booker is too exciting to pass up They should dish Booker for a lottery pick if they can The problem is I dont see Booker being valuable unless hes the go to guy Booker for Meyers straight up who says no Like if hes the third guy, and is bad on d His shooting is a problem off the balk *ball Idk about his defense I mean if theres anybody on that Suns roster I would need in a deal for AD its Jimmer ya feel me? Give us Booker for one year of good Dragic and the expiring contract! Homecoming! The funny think is James Jones said the suns are gonna go after "players in their prime" Lol aka Sarver is impatient But I agree with Ian. AD is worth Ayton OR Zion. Not both. He could leave after one year If the suns would have drafted just semi well they'd be in much better shape. Like maybe picking Jamal Murray over Dragan Bender, or De'Aaron Fox over Josh Jackson when they needed a PG Yeah I mean I dunno This worked for the sixers How about Westbrook and Adams for Booker, Ayton, Jackson and fillers Nahhhh I still believe in Russell People are overreacting over one series What if you guys had blown it up after the playoffs last year? See it's not the result of the season so much Yeah OKC shouldnt panic they need to tinker Also one underdiscussed thunder fuckup It's his enormous contract, wreckless style of play that doesn't age well, can't shoot Shopping off oladipo Well actually nvm They got pg In that trade I think he can start shooting better ala Jason Kidd late in his career I feel so bad for
Dipo But the contract and potential athleticism drop off could be bad He would have been an mvp candidate this year How can OKC tinker tho gundy? They're completely capped out with 3 guys Adams, Westbrook and PG take up 90% of the cap lol Add in Schroeder and they're over the cap with 4 guys I mean I think they could also tinker with their gameplan Fair I dunno the west is about to be wide open If you were a playoff team this year, I wouldnt do anything drastic A Kyle Korver/Wayne Ellington/etc signing Would do a lot for them Yeah especially with KD potentially gone Just someone who could space out the offense I really hope kawhi stays east I think it totally depends on how the raps do I think raps bucks will be an insane series If thats what goes down And I think it will Sixers already in full excuse mode Ian I would lowkey want to go to Milwaukee for a game if thats the series Yeah man! Me too I mean go to Chicago Right And take the train up for a game We could go up early though Eat cheese curds drink beer Did you guys know bill russell lives in Mercer island wa? I didnt know Mercer but I knew seattle His wife is also white lol Mark is the sports book back open? ? https://www.instagram.com/p/BxNUNvHFjit/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=1y21qrqg0jc0y Fuck Nick Gilbert I hope he gets the 14th pick ?Greatest return from retirement since Jordan? YES God 14 year old me wants to
Masturbate just from this text For sure. 29 year old me however is going to be watching ebony porn for weeks after that text Did the Swimsuit drop today or just the cover? Do you guys have any draft takes ?I think the whole thing. We got Alex Morgan too That was the last one I swear Jesus Ian I got a draft take. Zion will be the number 1 pick, but he may or may not be the best player in the draft Yes please halt the photos whilst I am at work. My standing desk is not conducive to constant boners At 13 Im hoping for Bol? 1. Nassir Little
2. Kevin Porter Jr.
3. Pj Washington I low key think Matisse Thybulle is a Heat culture player, at least from what draft people say about him We dont need any more Heat culture players We need a player who can hit an open 3 consistently Bonus points if they also know how to dribble Matisse looks like a late first in the mocks. Same with PJ. I'd love if Portland took either I dunno Id be surpised if pj fell that far Yeah he could def go lottery Him and Brandon Clarke are all over the board right now You guys I just stuffed like 10 Heinekens in my backpack from the office i feel like Im a Freshman again Lol I used to do that at Burnett so often My days of unlimited Heineken access are dwindling so I gotta do it Ian I misread at Burnett as with burnettes and almost threw up in my mouth If Portland can get Thybulle or Washington at 25 I would be very happy. Lol I cannot imagine pj falling to 25 He easily could Hes a fringe lottery pick And depending on how teams feel his foot injury is healing/how he does in workouts he could fall if he doesnt get picked in the lottery Talent wise, I would pick him in the lottery Tyler Herro on the other hand is a waste of a pick Id be surprised! But yeah it could happen I guess I want warriors bucks tonight Any takers? ?All these are pretty pointless rn but The bulls should pick Darius Garland Psh That draft is 11 days old Things have changed! Id be happy with Alexander-walker though Ok so Im a really smart guy This whole time Ive been meaning Thybulle is skipping the combine which means he probably already has a first round guarantee Keldom Johnson Keldon Jackie Mac and Zach Lowe talking blazers nuggets SMDFTB AJAX What happened MOURA hat trick Third goal in stoppage to put us through Woah WHAT IS THIS FEELING You know what I always say: 3-0 is the most dangerous lead in soccer Congrats bro Thats insane https://youtu.be/XV-tMFdmwwU Lmao what is going on in this interview Lmaooo James def tweaking off his 4th serving of preworkout WTF? https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1126242657666306056?s=21 What's going on The Real Lakers of Los Angeles!!!!!! ZC getting some love on the Lowe pod https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1126256298025279488?s=21 Lol so it's done? Different coach? Jason Kidd baby!!!! Omg haha. What about his birthday cake?! Im still mad about how the Suns did my guy Igor. Yeah dude that was fucked up Lakers should hire Jay Wright How about metta world peace https://www.instagram.com/p/BxNP-2rlUXC/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=1ct20duyxqm57 Would absolutely love to watch him go ballistic on a ref lol https://twitter.com/mcten/status/1126259947262631941?s=21 Lmao wow shoutout to ty lue flexing on em Lol this basketball court by my house is installing a scoreboard? ? Dude maybe they hoop in the summer ??? Yeah I dunno! I mean to be honest I think the court is prob part of the public housing unit So maybe for some type of league? Yeah probably Def curious the court still basically looks condemned but the installed high beams too? Go make it rain space Lol I would totally play Why not New Yorkers also have a reputation for broke ass jumpers They play physical but they cant shoot Better body up Ian Lol this aint Rucker Park https://twitter.com/shamscharania/status/1126264394550267905?s=21 Lmao murderers row over here I feel like Vogel gets one more chance Potentially. He was ass in Orlando Def Doesn't have the resume or cache of a Lakers coach tho None of those guys do Define lakers coach Because the lakers havent had a good coach since Phil And the team has been ass for the better part of a decade Top 5 brand in sports But also a laughing stock Used to be a top 5 brand in sports They still are Fan base and market ain't going anywhere Their fan base left for greener pastures in Oakland Sadly I can attest Our numbers have been crazy lmao There arent currently any unemployed coaches that fit the old lakers coach persona Yeah lakers still a top 5 and 1 in the nba It honestly sucks they have lebron cuz that's hampering everything lol. Can't have a normal coach with him Its just hard to find a big name coach that hasnt recently been fired I mean if lebron wasn't there I'd go with a young up and comer if they were still a powerhouse name, other coaches would be finding ways to end up there Theyd have to convince an established coach to switch over Thats my point Would they? That happens so rarely in basketball If the Lakers were a top 5 brand in all of sports, you dont think elite coaches would want to coach there? I mean theres so much pressure Since Phil left theyve had Mike Brown, Bernie Bickerstaff (five games!), Mike DAntoni (he got an ass hand dealt to him), Byron Scott, Luke Walton Dude they are for sure a powerhouse name. It's just a zoo for several reasons at the moment. The lakers don't just lose and gain allure on a whim And po essentially the only coach to survive lebron lol Spo survived LeBron because of Riley Not a knock against Sport *spo And theres just not much precedent for a great coach to switch teams Just a fact I agree BRING BACK PAT RILEY Four chips! Lebron is so goddamn high maintenance I can't believe I called him the GOAT at one time But honestly when was the last time an elite coach just up and switched nba teams Idk Not that I can remember Ian. You're right Closest they got in the last decade was coach K Phil Jackson is about to be fucking back But you're both right, who is a big name unemployed coach right now? There's not really my point is, the lakers isnt as attractive of a job as fans think it is Jeff van gundy is the nba's bill cowher You either have to bring someone out of retirement or high a top tier college guy They should bring a college guy in Bring don Nelson off the weed farm Not even kidding I dunno why they dont look at joerger Its not his fault the kings are inept The NBAs problem (all major sports league actually) is that they have an old boys club and they retread the same talent over and over Joerger been fired twice tho Hes good at developing young guys Oh yeah Joeger was fucking trying to get fired in Sac Yeah but should this season really be counted against him? Honestly I think Vanterpool is gonna be a goddamn stud The kings totally overachieved Buddy hield went from busy to potential all star Hire becky Hammon you cowards Who's the young college guy next in line? I dunno I barely pay attention to college hoops at this point Shaka smart doesnt appear to be the future anymore Theres always callipari Yeah Shaka flamed our Tony Bennett? Maybe Chris beard? Jay Wright would be bad ass but he ain't leaving Yeah I cant see Bennett leaving He has the chance to be such a hero And uva isnt duke but its a rich acc school In fertile recruiting territory Not sure his grit and grind style would translate either Id hire him in a heartbeat if I had the chance tho Also We all know lebron wants someone he can push around Calipari is a failed NBA coach And hes never leaving his lifetime UK deal https://www.instagram.com/p/BxNyXa1A8HZ/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=1mqorqg5wkst Jay Wright would definitely leave for the NBA If it was the right job and he would definitely take the lakers job They have some nice ass suit stores in LA You think? Shaka is gonna get fired at UT next year and Chris Beard is taking that job Pinstripes is more of an east cost look tho Pinstripes is more of a 1940s look Haha touch what if the Sixers fire Brett brown and he gets hired by LAL Nah Brett brown is safe for now Man last year there were so many solid coaches available https://twitter.com/sportstalkbarry/status/1126277406543831042?s=21 Bron fed up ?? Lol he quite literally did He joined the lakers He advocated for half the team to be traded He advocated for the coach to be fired He did not have a backup plan Is he just bitching bc the lakers wont hire Tyrone lue? Lmao thats not a real tweet is it?!? Yah what Man someone tell his its Giannis league now Lol no gundy I'm trollin Lmao thank you Lol fucker I am doing so much posting Is this Bostons swan song? Oh yeah Its over baby Kyrie has the LaMarcus look Just jacking up all the shots and not caring about the team I think your karma flipped when you told us to smdftb after game one The Celtics started missing shots And Kyrie lost his mind Well you have your theory, I have mine! What's your theory space My theory is karma was on Gundys side when he did the honorable thing and bet on his season long take that the Celtics would advance out of the east, and even bet the series straight up But all that good juju was erased When he told us to smdftb after game 1 Hence the inevitable outcome of this series Can I just point out how much harder better faster stronger the bucks look than the warriors rn Fair enuf Brock are you in Tokyo? Yeah Just about to hop over to Kyoto Oh nice Is that where youre finishing your trip? Or re you going back to Tokyo? ? Done 6 in Tokyo already. Got a few days in Kyoto then a few at Fuji and back in Tokyo for a last day Nice! Are you eating well? Drinking saki at noon? ? Yah food is cant miss. Love the machine ordering things lol I know lol It so fast paced it hardly feels like a vacation lol Its 3 times the size of New York So insane Fork yeah Brock japan is the shit! It feels like being at Coachella lol Imagine if they allowed drugs there Yah the teamlab borderless exhibit would be the place to do mushrooms The subways are so legit tho So easy to go anywhere Of fuck yeah - did you do that already? Yah two days ago it was dope Fuck I am so jealous. I would go back in a heartbeat the place is the best Have you eaten at a Katsu restaurant yet? Dude I felt that so hard cam If any city needs weed lol Weed is probably worse to them than oxy lol Or heroin or literally any drug Yeah but god damn do they love to drink Pro tip you can walk and drink on the street Little known fact I found out on my last day there Whoa did not know that Mygirlfriend wont let us walk and eat she says its rude Yeah its not great there but I feel it is mostly because there are no garbage cans to throw your trash away once your done so you have to carry it for the next 6 hours Lmao I know! I got this garbage in my hand I want it out as soon as possible You get a Starbucks in the morning and you have that fucking cup for the rest of the day Real American anxiety We started ducking into fast food restaurants and 7/11s But every bathroom is 10/10 Never had a cleaner butthole Uh oh Marcus smart bonked his noggin! Smarf ?? I feel like brook lopez is gonna be such an X factor in the finals Bucks fans going nuts for offensive rebounds lol Damn Gundy You ruined my opportunity to Venmo request you for smdftb Ive had this charted out! I* Damn I wanna look into something Unfortunate If you bet on high seed road team Lol Now all you get is the 50 bucks lol With the exception Aside; you dont bet cash against a team called the bucks (ChaChing!) But anyway With exception to major injuries Huh seed road team Bets Last two years And fuck it To make it a theory Throw lebron out of the equations Im gonna do this math and share my findings And by major injuries I will only include If your hands down best player missed more than half the series To keep it objective Remember last year when people were like "would you rather have Giannis or Brad Stevens?" Lmao Bro you gotta love Giannis I would just like to say I never based my bet on Brad Stevens I thought Boston had more talent smh They literally played better and won more with the same team, minus kyrie and Hayward. That's absurd The guy was born and raised without any citizenship to Nigerian parents in Greece, grew up helping his parents sell watches or whatever on the street, gets drafted outside the lottery to a small market team, isnt even a candidate for rookie of the year, slowly the rashly gets better, becomes the most dominant player in the league doing shaq shit and magic shit, never talks shit in the media but talks fucking mad shit on the court Not to mention hes the best athlete the league has seen since prime lebron Arguably (probably) better as a pure athlete Ian I think that's the most you've ever combined into one single text. Congrats But yes I concur with all that. Just a likable superstar. Feel good story Also I love that story from his rookie year. When he was wiring money back to his family. And he went to western union and accidentally wired back his entire paycheck. So he didn't have any money to get to the stadium for his game, and started jogging down the street to the game. Some random family stops and is like "yo are you that bucks rookie? Wanna ride to the game?". And he casually gets in lmao Hes just the man Weve never had a foreign player as the hands down best player in the league Maybe Hakeem while Jordan was out Lets fucking go Houston Its always fuck golden state PJ Tucker playing center right now lmao Wow slander to dirk about best foreign player ever I didnt say that I said this might be the first time a foreign player was the best player in the league I know dirk and Steve Nash won mvps But I dont think in any single season They were the best player in the league? Dirk no, Nash maybe lol I switched my game day beer from corona to familiar Bc of this group Nash was sooooo good on the Mavs And it hits
So much harder And I guess first few years on subs What year? I dunno 01-02 season Only averaged 18 pts per game, but 45% from three, 48 from 2 and 8 assists a game Ah but not sure hed be better than timmy I guess Yeah Or Kobe or shaq Jk Yeah or even iverson Iverson averaged 31 that year His suns years were his best years Yeah probably not than Ian lol He won two mvps! Yeah, if he wouldve stayed on mavs, him and dirk wouldve been so good I mean Giannis this year Is better than either of dirk or Nashs best season! Dame this year is better than either dirk or Nash too Hmmmmm I dont buy that Regardless Giannis has the chance to become the next lebron Like a different level of stardom The bucks are gonna open up as finals favorites next year Yes he is I dont know for sure if they will, will depend on what happens to warriors If they keep Durant, they are probably still favorites Familiar is next level space. Crisper, Fuller taste and more alcohol content. Sign me up Pacifico till I die I dont drink corona But Ill have a familiar Pairs well with nicotine gum! I have limited immediate options For beer *drinks familiar once*

*becomes warriors fan* Was there one consistent face of the nba post Jordan pre lebron? Like 99-07 Corona, modelo, presidente, Heineken, Coors light Lol yeah not a big microbrew scene up here Gotta be shaq, Kobe, Duncan, Iverson, Nash right Well thats not true I can go to a grocery store Is just not like I can walk to the bodega and get that Yup ?Do you wear a bathrobe to the bodega ala Carmelo? And wasnt that when the Kobe and Denver thing happened? lol Gotta include KG if youre putting Nash on that. Id go Kobe for overall factors Oh yeah I think that was around 03 Dehaan lol Agree Rengel HHa What a headline, can you imagine if that happened to like harden right now? Lol that would be nuts Internet would explode Fuck the sharks Fuck the bay Rengel Did you read our conversation? Ya most of it I think Kevin Garnett wasnt a foreign player? I was talking about chads list Yao Ming was bigger than Giannis in popularity Rudy fernandez bigger than Giannis All Giannis has is live sports and big hands. Yao had a super bowl commercial Yeah sorry space I was just saying who was the face of the nba From 99 post MJ to 07 when lebron cemented it Oh yeah man it was def up for debate back then ?? I guess it still is But like Its been lebron For so long We forget I can't believe Nash won an MVP averaging 15 Fucking points lmao Pretty crazy but that was lowest point of nba Wow looking at these stats is pretty wild now Nash was 18th in PER and 15th in win shares lmao Amare averaged 26/9 and was 3rd in win shares and 4th in PER Kobe and lebron both averaged 27/6/6 but missed the playoffs Honestly shoulda been Dirk that year. 26/10/3. 2nd in win shares. 5th in PER. Team finished 4th He got hosed Hate to say it but best story for nba is kyrie going to LA No more west firepower This is Portland's time https://www.instagram.com/p/BxOZii6oLgn/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=xxb1wqint6r Are they gonna post this after every series lol Presidents is the #1 bodega beer and its not even close Presidente* Man warriors frontcourt is so vulnerable mmmmm Omg KD Achilles Hey Did KD just pop his Achilles Uh oh Might be torn Man I know this is the series everybody cares about but I cannot be bothered to watch these games Dude he's done Bucks rockets Come on blazers!!!! Blazers bucks! Oh fuck Dame just got hyped Holy shit guys this is destiny Well hopefully hes sleeping It's our turn for fortune Gahhhhhh Goddamn I just want one authentic finals! Man the warriors are weaseling out of this counting against their legacy fuck this! Yeah that sucks Built in excuse now Omg what if this is the one thing that makes KD stay in GS now I wanna see the warriors lose more than anything Then they win 3 more when he recovers But this is lame https://twitter.com/cjmccollum/status/1126341684038471685?s=21 ? Is KD really gonna change teams on a torn Achilles? Think about it Yeah that is a good point But will other leave is the question? Yeah I mean Im pretty confident tbh Oh shit man If kd is indeed gone Bucks win Durant Maybe have torn Achilles And next year that could be an epic showdown Well lets bask in the curry draymond humiliation Yes gundy you are 3 min behind Catch up! Text terry and tell him to get the team ready to go! Lol dont flip out But what if its Denver My phone was off lol Lol gundy you watching the game on dial up? Poor warriors tho. Two all stars down and they only have 3 left A true underdog story Guys Steph Is gonna killed murdered Called a fraud He is a fraud Its gonna be so great lol I'm gonna revel in every moment Matt how's that Carlton Steph meme coming? Lol he won a championship, an mvp, and had the best record in the nba Pre Durant However Hes about to get roasted Not top 20! Omg draymond already having a breakdown https://twitter.com/rudygay/status/1126343617231114241?s=21 I mean all time for what its worth Brock Fellow Achilles tear club analysis Lillard top PG in the league After Steph shits his pants Or Jamal Murray https://twitter.com/shamscharania/status/1126345048789065729?s=21 That was quick We need the mamba to speak on this Woj just said Achilles Woj said not Achilles It's a calf Fucking fuck Just realized Im not following shams I bet they're posturing Am I even an nba fan? Update came too quick Curry legacy on the line! In your defense shams is all gated content now that he's with the athletic. I'm a free 99 guy myself Warriors are winning the championship Yeah that was like the three confirmed injuries in the mass death news report Best case, Durant fine but out till finals, blazers beat warriors in western conference finals Durant is still gonna miss the rest of the series Soft tissue injuries dont just go away I love how an injury happens and instantly everyone becomes a twitter doctor I love hard tissue injuries The whole world turns into Houman with an offshore medical degree Yeah but he might have a hobbled curt schilling-esque game 7 Where he just plops jumpers over everyone and slows the game down Wow KD bloody sock game. I love that He starts backing people down above the 3pt line like magic with AIDS I dunno mj getting carried off the court Its just saying kd is one of the few players That could find a way to win When his body fails him If his jumper is on Lol crude references but youre not wrong chad ?KD coming back for game 7 Lmfaooooo Chad I could see it from KD KD = Bitch at end of the day People forget Well ?KD can't wait with them cats Win* Good a time as ever to remember Houston was up 3-2 last year when Paul went down I love how PJ Tucker can be more physical with Steph than any blazer can be with Jokic Really fucking great Everyone gonna day Paul is not Durant but lets also remember rockets finished with the best record in the nba last year! Paul is pretty washed now tho. Harden and Gordon carry the load Lets also remember Eric Gordon is really good again How many familiars have you drank tonight? Ligawide question I had a few heinekens But I stopped like 2 hours ago Lo Lol 2 for me Saving the other 4 for tomorrow I have a 6 pack a night but Im a republican now so thats basically like having just a sip https://twitter.com/profootballdoc/status/1126347323879989248?s=21 A real doctor speaks! Is he a doctor like dr Oz is a doctor? Also what happened? KD get hurt? Are you implying that dr. Oz is NOT a doctor? Says it right In the name Hahaha draymond He just cant be chill Its impossible for him Dr Doolittle, also a Dr Curry so trash Lol goddamnit Riding Klay and draymond Yeah but Well fuck it Harden time Fuck Curry is so bad Bailed him out Not top 20 Dude harden where are you Bro harden had like a perfect possession? Everybody swarmed him and he found Capella in like 5 sec? The whole quarter tho hes been quiet Steph has outplayed him in the 4th Damn They had the turnover Wow Foul on Livingston? He sat on Gordon's head Watching this game with Turner is nothing less than obnoxious God fucking damnit Evergreen text cam They had that steal True that God fuck Fuck curry and his bitch ass Were owed one more exciting play Damnit They had that Damn So rockets are gonna crush next game No Durant And then Durants gonna come back for game 7 Wait if all these series go 7, we get a game 7 triple header on Sunday? I'll be cumming my pants all day Lol yeah potentially On the sabbath no less That's incredible Lol I dunno https://twitter.com/sbjohn12/status/1126355248514256896?s=21 Lol I love how Oracle started chanting MVP for curry again the moment KD went down TNT giving Kerr 2 f bombs Incredible lmaooo Hahhahahaha Omg Espn with an absolute smearing of Kyrie https://www.google.com/amp/www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/26702069/kyrie-irving-failed-leadership-tells-story-celtics-failed-season%3fplatform=amp Omg that article is such an attack its ridiculous lol The best part is its so pre-written lol Tim bontemps or whatever Just couldnt wait to post that shit Oh that shit was definitely pre-written lmao Well whats changed Just read through it dont see whats untrue in there The I texted lebron thing was the most annoying thing to me. Obviously a humble brag and actually just throwing his own young players under the bus Yeah the guys on tnt are calling it this season was an epic disaster for Boston https://youtu.be/mE2i3PlTsvs If you dont know this story its worth a 9 minute watch Dane cook breaks down his brother embezzling 12 million from him on Tom Seguras podcast ?Whoa Oh no lmaooo ESPN talking about the Lakers trading Lebron lmaooo Lol what would they get for him? That would be so funny Evan turner, Meyers Leonard and Anfernee Simons who says no? He just gets thrown on like the wizards or something Im just saying dame needs a 3rd option until nurkic comes back I say no to that Gundy Saw the nugs were mentioned Why would the nuggets wanna fuck up their young core? No way that trade doesnt involve Jokic Lebron is great but hes aging and he cant do it alone He also couldnt even make the playoffs lol It def wouldnt include Jokic So just Jamal Murray and a pick? It def wouldnt include murray either imo I mean whats in it for la Gotta think they could do better than that package idk your boy Tim bontemps said nuggets sniffed around today Wed have to trade CJ for him I'd trade CJ, Simons and Meyers My guy Scoop B was on that too Oh would you lol? Hes still a top 3 player lol Lmao I know it sounds ridiculous But his market would be very unique How many teams actually would trade for him? 5 or 6? Yah Im not sure what he would fetch very weird situation I know it is so weird I mean gms make these decisions based on selling tickets and merchandise too I dunno what to do with that But it seems like it factors in Yeah that's a good point space Also only 2 years on his deal which plays into it as well Absolutely Honestly he should just go back to Cleveland lmao Honesty if I were LA I'd just see if New Orleans would swap AD for Lebron lol I wish we had literally anything to offer Lakers add AD to all their young guys and sign Klay Yeah that would be amazing Can we see some S&T's for once this summer? Disgruntled star swaps or something https://twitter.com/nbadraftwass/status/1126310258626965504?s=12 Neil is probably jerking off to this Im jerking off to that tweet! It is pretty incredible how they've built that team.. but when you find the next lebron that's pretty much all you need Took a bullshit sick day today I know I agree chad Theyre like the pistons or something if you subtract giannis Haha exactly Theyre well coached though I really think bud is one of the best coaches in the league Yeah I like bud I think he was super under appreciated in Atlanta Kinda like DAntoni in Phoenix Ian I'm wfh today too. My boss is in Hawaii all week I was like what am I doing going into the office Work from home boyszzzz I feel like I should go do something ?Also check out this May sun!!! Lol we live in very different places ? Lol I'm a suburb guy now I go to Home Depot and shit on the weekends ? Yeah I would have considered that if I stayed in (or go back) to Chicago The old man life is honestly pretty sweet tbh I scheduled a float for today! I need to zen out before the blazers game ?And I can see downtown from my place. Just a quick Uber to the fun Im looking forward to the old man life Chad. Is there a house available on your block? Lets be neighbors Yeah in Chicago you can buy a house in the middle of the city lol its ridiculous I feel you Gundy I got a massage yesterday Cam, yes there's some quaint townhouses right down the block I'm trying to recruit more bros Is cam moving to Denver? Think about all the snowboarding biscuit! Got offered WCF tickets for $100 from my nuggets guy and almost pulled the trigger.... Then I was like hold up why would I pay to go to an empty stadium? Suck my dick Portland in 7!! I hope that's the juju we needed HAHAHA Ive been thinking about making a change Denver is on the list but Portland is the current frontrunner of course As with basketball I can tell you, leaving California was a breath of fresh air. Both literally and figuratively Ok but like dont you miss paying the taxes? As much as I enjoy partaking in my civic duty to pay taxes, they can smdftb God tonight is gonna be a powder keg at the rose garden I think Im going tonight I will light that fuse Gundy the more I think about it, the more I'm convinced that Blake Griffin is our best chance at the promise land He's the missing piece Blake at 100% is a top 10 player Hes so versatile If he could be on a good team that didnt rely on him to carry them all the time Those clippers teams were really good We need beef and shooting at the 4. Obviously he's kind of a pipe dream but that would be the perfect player for our current roster I dunno if he wants out of Detroit tho He seems to like it there Players love Dwayne Casey Agreed. It'd have to be an ownership wanting to save money move And he might turn them around On a more realistic note; Marcus Morris, jaMychal green, Bobby Portis would all be interesting options Bro dont be a Morris twin team Yeah they suck I'm desperate here. The bar is closing and I'm squinting real hard Honestly this team with nurkic back and no Durant in the west Its gonna be like back when Dallas and Phoenix and San Antonio were competing There are favorites, but like 5 teams could go I agree. We just need one more shooter. We can't rely on Harkless and Aminu to make open shots consistently Space I'm glad someone else stayed home to talk hoops midday with me Dude when I emailed in sick I told them Im happy to work from home They said no, take a full test day lol I have nothing to do at all I'm watching Russilo and Jacoby right now Lol This is the only time anyone watches espn Honestly its just for the nostalgia at this point Every time I watch sport center I always think to myself wow Im watching sports center I watch SVP Daytime ESPN is pretty bad, though.

I know you got them receipts!" Portland to Denver $347 round trip flights Seth Curry called the nuggets sassy front runners Hero Sassy is kind of a pussy word but I'll take it Seth is a man of God Man I'll tell you what tho. I just did a 180 on Jokic after that Nurk comment. That was dope Jokic is cool but Im glad we are hating him Its good natured sports hate Yeah we're gonna beat the shit outta those bitches on Sunday Mother's Day ass whooping Reading b edge and Denver stiffs tho, these fans are hostile af I'm gonna need security in the Pepsi center after Portland wins God I wish I could go I'll represent the liga well. You'll all be with me in spirit Hell yea dude Also Rodney Hood has been on two teams that won Game 7 on the road Jazz over Clippers in 2017 and LeBron at Boston last year When are they going to announce time of game 7?? Its either gonna be at 4 or at 6:30/7 If Houston wins tomorrow Game 7 of that series is the early game Then Sixers Raptors Then blazers after If GSW wins sixers raptors will be the early game and we will play at 4 probably ?Mark doing God's work Lmaoooo This is fucking priceless "well actually " https://www.instagram.com/p/BxRUi-0gywl/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=65cc64v8gidn God I can't wait to get him back. What a quote God I cant wait to repeat next year when we get him back We need to find a way to keep Kanter and hood https://twitter.com/hpbasketball/status/1126862884938498049?s=21 So if the game is at 330 Kanter is not eating or drinking Sick lol Never would I have rooted for the rockets before but I guess I have to now Go rockets! Lolol Thats crazy I mean its just luck Go rockets Shit I really need the rockets to win I got Mothers Day plans bro Yeah dehaan I agree. Idk if we're gonna be able to pay them tho There's a bunch of fucked up contract restraints on what we can offer a one year player, and we don't have the MLE cuz we're in the tax Ask ms Allen for one year in tax to keep them cuz then we drop 38 million next off season, or by trade deadline https://twitter.com/nbcsnorthwest/status/1126784060733444096?s=21 Lol Nah like we can't physically offer them over a certain amount. With the one year deals. We don't have full bird rights Yeah that was so fucked gundy I mean lol it was a joke in poor taste Its the like he was advocating for him to get kicked in the shin Cant we offer them like 2-3 year deals? If this turns into a controversy its gonna be so dumb We can yeah but it's capped at a low dollar amount. Basically like 150% of what they are currently making plus yearly raises. And Curry, Kanter and Hood have all outplayed their deals. I'll try and see what best case scenario we could offer them is I mean Ian, that's pretty bad lol you can't just say that's a harmless joke I don't think it should be a headline, but the dude definitely needs to apologize and probably the team too Its not a controversy its just like dude, get over it with nurkic man Denver fucking hates him They just cant get over the fact he was unhappy there Lulu said her dad used to play basketball all the time during Ramadan. Kanter is being a bitch. #muslimsportstakes Its bad because he did it for a broadcast I that was like on twitter But it wasnt on twitter so what are we discussing ??Dehaan here is the Curry situation. Olshey fucked up my not offering him the full Taxpayer Mid Level, which lowered the ceiling you could offer Curry if he played well this year (which happened) Fair! Yeah Space quit moving the goal posts Lol well what do you propose? Let us hate Denver Ian! Is it fireable? One game suspension Just a quick lil apology? For Game 7 Most we could offer Hood or Kanter is probably the tpMLE which would be 3 years 18 million Lmaooo Honestly yeah I say one game suspension is fair Probably an on air apology at the minimum He should double the fuck down is what he should do! Honestly that's just really fucking bush league pettiness coming from them tho We should feel lucky we got a group of class acts on our side KC, Lamar, Wheels Wheels is on the bench right now ?? Is he sick again? We gotta win this for wheels Yeah hes done for the playoffs Damn. I mean homie ain't in the greatest shape. He needs the Al Roker surgery Fun fact: Matt Cox used to call high school football games with the blazers interim radio guy Wheels is without a doubt the biggest dude Ive ever seen And also the dopest announcer He is massive. Fond memories of listening to him call games on the radio when I didn't have cable in elementary school Hes also the king of shading the other team Last thing on the salary cap, we may have to use our 1st to shed ET and try to duck under the Tax. Then we'd get the Full MLE and the Bi-Annual Exception and be able to likely keep all 3 guys ?Some good tickets popping up. These are row 2 for $120 each When do you guys think is the best time to buy? Now Think the price only goes up from here? They wont drop by more than 20% but they could go up Unlimited https://twitter.com/worldwidewob/status/1125986761681854465?s=21 Yeah but chad A playoff ticket is worth 120 bucks Buy* Also what if Houston wins that will only drive up the price Cause then people will believe the west is wide open The casuals will get inspired Wow good call dudes Okay I'll buy this morning What time dies this game have potential to be? 12:30 and 3:30? 12:30 or 6:30 Fork We will know by tonight but thats not great Yeeeeah please god let it not be 12:30 I swear to god if the Rockets dont win James harden is a fraud So if the Warriors win we will be 6:30 If the Rockets win 12:30? CJ averaging more than Steph in the playoffs makes me so happy Also crazy that the nuggets have done so well putting this roster together while also getting nothing for Nurkic and drafting and trading both Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert for nothing lmao They probably shouldn't trade with Utah anymore https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/08/nikes-app-is-getting-a-new-sizing-feature-heres-how-it-will-work.html This is pretty wild I just met some of the HeadGum podcast guys and talked about our shared love of Portlands son Ian Karmel ?Suck my nuts Denver !!!!! Denver a bunch of fair weather front runners Cam that sizing thing is a game changer. I already buy most clothes/shoes online but not knowing the right fit is so annoying https://youtu.be/NB3mmuPXGOw lmao Fox sports completely ripped off a line from the wire in this spot You come at the queen, you best not miss God thats such bullshit Oh is that from the wire? I Thought Fox copywriters wrote that Huge pet peeve: when people at work say something is going live at 7am PST when they mean PDT. https://www.instagram.com/p/BxSzo6GlxUC/?igshid=r6rbnfqdr90f Shit, this guys cracked the code, the Lakers r back It's called an homage idiots ?????? https://mobile.twitter.com/wjxt4/status/726941052691701760?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fd-35293509274151656284.ampproject.net%2F1904301721170%2Fframe.html Goat ?Hahaha Karmel coming in hot and this nuggets writer is pissed Does he not realize the dude is a comedian Bahaha God fuck the nuggets So fucking good lol I love the nba playoffs And how it makes two random fan bases want to kill each other https://twitter.com/bro_pair/status/1125565127661473792?s=21 I love the hatred with Denver now Dude I had a die hard Denver guy flat out tell me the Nugs are #4 in town behind the Broncos, Avs and Rockies I don't reach much local stuff, but that article was so arrogant and condescending even for local standards Pathetic they dont even deserve to move on After 3 months here I can confirm that sentiment clay Thats crazy Rockies are big business and they suck I guess for me its always weird to see hockey be something people care about Everyone loves the longball Well chicks dig it thats for sur Dude every city I've been in outside Oregon Fucking loves hockey. Hate to break it to you Even Phoenix We're in the minority Totally I know that but its just weird for me to see over NBA I love Hockey thats the best live sport Ive been to a blues game and multiple knights games Phoenix doesnt care about sports dont kid yourself Yeah it's interesting how our biases can play such a role in perception. I feel like it's NBA over everything but the ratings are pretty shit compared to other sports Haha true everyone is transplants so there's no Phoenix fans There all Midwest sports fans for sure This Ben Shapiro thing is hilarious too. He went on BBC to promote his book about politics becoming so enraged and divisive. Then proceeded to yell at the interviewer, rip his mic off and storm out I think Elon is right. This is all a simulation and we're being trolled https://twitter.com/sfkale/status/1126932316008222720?s=12 Wow Denver is really doing this ? When did Denver get so high and mighty? They didn't even make the playoffs last year They got the pillsbury doughboy playing center and were soft? Last I checked, they were getting upset about hard fouls. Yeah they were bitching super hard about fouls last night, yet they shot more free throws? Had to tweet that shit out https://twitter.com/erik_gundersen/status/1126953925888733184?s=21 Hope dame and the boys see it lol Alright guys ya boy is in the building Section 138 Only $113 I was surprised You should get the above graphic on some booty shorts to wear to the game chad. Did Maroney ever produce receipts? Rodney was so hot last night that there are residual effects. Portland set a new high temp today. Yeah chad I was wondering about that Even if it did happen... how was he planning on proving it? You guys see Maroney is getting cucked out of being the Big 3 guy? ? ? You hate to see it He looks like the mad magazine guykind of His follower count is also in the double digits I dont know where this dude came from Oliver Maroney with a mask from mission impossible So he can start his brand over My guy DJ Mbenga Ice Cube legitimately has negative respect for Oliver if this dude is a real person But dude ice cube is one of the most genuinely good dudes I've ever been around. It's amazing to see that guy juggle so many things from movies to music and now a basketball league Chris Paul just said Jokic is the #1 player of the playoffs *Paul Pierce. Wow drunk already And they're all picking the nuggets as the best chance to win the title outside of the warriors ??????? Also the NBA on ESPN crew are clowns And Jalen rose thought the nuggets were the #1 seed lmao Fucking. Clowns. That group is a mess Legit just trying to replicate Inside the NBA And so bad at it Not even bad at it but just bad in general ? Mark https://twitter.com/chrisbhaynes/status/1127013881321283585?s=21 Can I gamble What's ur guys opinion on this pujols 2,000 hit ball thing ? Dunno enough about baseball Pujols himself told the fan to keep it didn't he? https://twitter.com/colincowherd/status/1127013386720440320?s=21 This is one of the stupidest takes I've ever fuckin seen Ya but all that happened after the incident between tigers and fan Moreso that part The whole if u keep it we won't authenticate it and then it's worth nothing part Trying to strongarm him Space has to change his shorts after that tweet I just wanna know who is in the wrong Inject this curry performance into my veins ? "blazers , nuggets" FOH BALL DONT LIE god I hate James garden Harden ^Warriors fan James Garden sounds like the type of place you would find hair in your unlimited soup, salad, and breadsticks. https://twitter.com/omaroneynba/status/1127044615947685890?s=12 then again there are plenty of other great apparel companies out there Ok but that logo??gear is ?? Yeah it is Too bad Maroney just killed Trillblazin ? https://twitter.com/nbcsnorthwest/status/1126784060733444096?s=21 Welp 12:30 it is Houston absolutely fell apart More eyes on Lillard tho It was 99-92 right? Warriors +250 ML ????? ?? God I was ready to roast Steph after that first half but I can't say shit now Fuck. Where do the rockets go from here? Stay the course? CP played well tonight but idk how much he has left in the tank Yeah I dunno this is the most they could ask for I dunno maybe they age well like the spurs or Dallas with dirk Goddamnit Timbers ?Mark found your competition Fuck this SNKRS app I just want the Travis Scott's ? https://twitter.com/joelegacy_/status/1127216591110852608?s=21 Dubov can you confirm or deny that this was a setup SNKRS more like FCKRS God Im so annoyed with the fucking rockets rn The rockets screwed themselves with Cp3 contract Their going to have to give harden big money Theyre Thank you sir The thing you gotta understand about SNKRS is that while theyve made tremendous improvements in the app year over year, its still a really young app and there is a tiny team that runs it. Theres no way it can handle the amount of traffic that it had today. You and literally everybody else want whatever shoes launched today ?Yeah it's the number 1 trend right now lol. Apparently that was the most hyped drop of the year Yeah it is far from perfect, but its not our key capability as a company. Its not funded the way it needs to be to keep up. Thats the No. 1 complaint I would always hear from our web dev/producer Yeah its super frustrating because our leadership team keeps signaling to investors that were a tech company and we want to move at the speed of the consumer but any big launch is total clusterfuck Yeah also it seems like people making choices on the tech arent exactly tech people? Our guy is probably gonna go back to Nike cause he can actually help this with that shit But its hard for one person to change things lol Oh yeah the decisions are coming despite the recommendations from the tech people Ehhh that horseshit Nike just needs to cough up the ?? to standup some aws servers to take care of the app surges for these drops Because its literally on the calendar you can plan for it I agree with mark Also kinda of a side note, but does Nike care one way or another about the whole bot epidemic? I'm sure they dgaf and just wanna sell shoes But it'd be real easy to screen for those and let real people get the shoes They do screen out most bots At checkout Oh really? See never made it that far so I wouldn't know lol All those bots have multiple email addresses set up that use the same payment source so the app recognizes the card number linked to multiple accounts and kills the transaction and puts the shoes back in inventory I don't think adidas does tho cuz I know a guy who wrote a bunch of scripts and buys every yeezy that way I mean theyre obviously not catching all of them but a good number For sure I agree they need to invest waaaaayyyy more in their servers https://www.instagram.com/p/BxVWamDDDdI/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=wfugudymcec2 Wtf is this bullshit Stay east fam I want this return Foh it's Portlands show in the west now Lmao Dame and CJ better I want it too Gotta be honest I need king James back on top The Lakers being good makes being a Blazers fan better I love beating them Its the greatest feeling in the world https://www.instagram.com/p/BxVThpej9Ev/?igshid=1065k7xhcwtr7 Vogel szn baby!

If we had a Morris brother vs aminu taking that shot wed be in the finals Garry Harris is a little cuntnugget ??

ZC getting good contests on millsap he's just hitting everything We are 0-6 from 3 Yes Theyre never gonna call a foul for us in the paint apparently Just the start we needed Cant buy a bucket This, folks, is how you lose by 25 0-8 Jamal Murray is soft I like how Malone's main assistant looks just like him That guy knows what he's doing Kanter is so worthless right now unless he fucking eats Honestly, we should probably be down more shooting 7-25 Get loud Chad!

Ok lets focus on each free throw Lets go Get zack outta there ET back in What is that call Meyers time Lets go Jokic flying elbows everywhere Give me 4 minutes of the hammer Death by a million floaters All poop from Turner Evan Turner is the worst player in the nba There's not a single shot that I feel good about when it comes out his hand Jesus Christ Evan turner what the fuck He had the angle to keep going and he just threw it up ? Looking at the plants on commercial breaks gives me peace Like what the fuck His short arm shot is uglier than Aminu's catapult Go to the rim Im about to drink an ton of wine at Argyle to forget about this Denvers trap d in the perimeter is so frustrating We're Kristaps and they're the Russians that beat his ass Meyers time In Game 7?!?

He didnt fuck up in a Game 7 on the road Neither did Layman then. Based on that. So give him some credit too! Meyers played and didn't do terrible! ET too! Dude he literally dunked on Jokic And defended the fuck out of him I hate those fuckers more than anything but i gotta give them shine when due Gunz youre still trying to defend your Meyers take from 4 years ago Please just stop and well forget you ever said he was going to be good Also, dame last game calling out Meyers by name and saying he provides a ton of leadership meant something to me Im not Im just trying to say give him his due when he earns it If dame fucks with you, I fuck with you Not fully, but still. Give him props Gundy and I ain't letting up on this one Meyers has a dead dog and is a cuck but he's our pussy Also how about Enes Kanter Just stoning Jokic late Dude such an incredible win What did Charles and team say after? I haven't seen any broadcast Also Harkless stepping up after getting benched and not pouting Like just a true team win Harkless killed it. Big time dunk and good D Denver went so cold too They didnt say much when I heard them talking about it but they were praising cj Also Hood isnt seriously hurt text from my mom - "Woke as fuck team??????????????????" ? Was Charles reaffirming his blazers finals prediction? Not really but he may have been doing that when the broadcast started We got him, Kenny and the truth on our side tho Need the raps to pull this out Mark Guess where I'm at?? I fucking love Enes ? Well to end the suspense. I'm at a strip club. Mark loves it Go Blazers Chad there is mass confusion here in Japan as your blazers fueled erection can be seen looming over the ocean LFG Philly!!!!

Kawhi Not Us #1 Gentlemens club in the greater Denver area I fell asleep after the 1st quarter of the raptors game 9 beers and a shot for the Blzers game will do that Apparently Marc Gasol almost had a double double!

Lot of 3s? Man I love watching embiid cry Hey guys, just a reminder that Meyers Leonard scored in a game 7. Anything is possible And was the 3rd most important player in the team yesterday And he dunked on an all star in a Game 7 on that all stars home court God Matt Moore is in hour 16 of his blazers meltdown and its giving me life Who's that HP Basketball Whats the tl;dr Hes on a war path that Portland is going to get swept Because theyre actually not that good And they got lucky against Denver ? Like look at this shade lmao he is so mad Lol what a clown He must have lost money I hope so but he really doesnt like the blazers cause they make him look dumb every year Yeah he's been talking shit about the blazers all year I don't get it. There's gotta be some back story I still cant believe that Kawhi shot As the kids would say "Matt Moore punching the air right now" Game seven buzzer beater off the rim like that Thats like the end of a kids sports movie lol This is the best playoff already since 2016 I fully believe Milwaukee gonna win now Until they play the blazers Lol Lolol Yeah Houman can we get a Fucking update already? That would be awesome tho How many people got the final 4 right? I know I did I know I didnt Yeah I have 3 I had Spurs-Warriors/Celtics-Raps Yeah I just had Denver ?Learn from the pro Damn nice bracket Your first round was great too lol Yeah the hardest is picking the exact number of games tho Like Celtics sweep round 1 Lottery tomorrow I swear to god if the Lakers get the No. 1 pick I dont know what Ill do but Ill be fucking irate Everyone is saying the heat are hot on Romeo Langford Romeo Langford is gonna be a stud I said I needed a day off from basketball today but Im already fiending. I need my fix. Whos got that basketball crack I need? I'd rather the Lakers than the Cavs Im already over the curry brother narrative Same MVP vs 8th man isn't like some epic brother battle Yeah it really doesnt mean anything ?Thank the lord Pffft Steven dont know shit Speak it into existence cam Add Zion and thats a dope squad I only trust Chris broussard this time of year He always has the inside scoops God man I hate all this love for embiid rn Talks more shit than anyone in the league This where we kick him while hes down! Fuck all this what a competitor! Bs Idk on first take they were saying sixers should trade him and build around Simmons Hahahaha No way Tom Haberstroh reported the sixers and lakers might discuss a Simmons for LeBron swap So the lakers would have two point guards that cant shoot? Theyd have to move ball That couldnt be an nba backcourt lol And theyd have to be the best defensive team in the league To win games Lmao two guys would be getting double teamed For you GOT fans who are just as upset with the slowly wrapping outcomes of these past episodes - we have a new starbucks cup. https://www.tmz.com/2019/05/13/game-of-thrones-jaime-lannister-hand-grows-back-cersei/ I didnt even bother watching last night I was too tired after celebrating the blazers all afternoon I mean this season is just a turd swirling a toilet bowl at this point man you guys sure did turn on this tv show pretty fast Meyers Leonard in Game of thrones out SCORCHING HOT TAKE Hahaha 2019 is crazy!

Wow nba Twitter with a great point. We gotta root for the bucks cuz if it's the raptors we play in the finals, kanter can't travel to Toronto Just bet 15 on the blazers for the series +375 Id rather play Toronto without kanter Than Milwaukee I kinda feel like it will be like their last series Can you imagine Meyers Leonard starting in an NBA Finals game lmao Bucks are a bit rusty and lose game 1 And then are unstoppable throughout We split the season series against both but that doesnt really mean anything lol We had a good game at Toronto but that was pre Nurk injury ?Man this is a rag tag group compared to 2000 Thats what makes this team so special Literally nobody expected this The bucks also did win that one game by 43 Yeah but I think we beat them by 20 lol That 43 point loss was also the end of a 6 game road trip https://www.instagram.com/p/BxaJWrTAYK-/?igshid=zigbtczruggy Neil expected this Has Neil been vindicated? I mean what else could you ask for? That kanter signing low key saved the season Youre in the conference finals And yes Have one of the youngest rosters in the league lol Kanter and Hood both. We don't win game 3 or game 6 without Hood Yeah the Kanter signing and hood trade for the spare change in our couch I wonder how this all affects nurks stock I was looking at lanterns stats and hes basically produced at the same if not a higher clip In the playoffs than Nurk did in the regular season I know its a small sample size tho Any hood updates? Has his wind returned to him??? Eh idk space. Nurk's defense is on another level. Kanter has been similar offensively tho Hyper extension Gundy with the best doctor take of the year ? Oh Jesus Christ canzano just picked Portland in 6 What is happening Omg Go home John Cue the blazers in 6 jokes I just listened to locked on Nuggets cause Im addicted to Denver media tears If only Gary Harris had taken more shots they would have won! So assuming those lines hold Wh ya got? Game one(s) Zers Bucks sweep NBA Finals Superliga trip to Milwaukee is destiney Lol one game at a time *destiny Lol Lol I kinda wanna go on Friday Destiney is a stripper Do you think Planet Pat would let us stay with him even if were cheering for Portland?

Or should I say a Miles fan Not so fast my friend I am prepared to eat crow But it hasnt been served up yet Wow I just read the blazers are a tier behind the rockets Did I miss something? Blazers gotta be above them now Guys guess who has the best plus minus in the blazers in the playoffs Collins Meyers Meyers You got it lmao Meyers it is Seth Curry No. 2 Lmao he's the unicorn we've been waiting for 7 years building up his powers Collins No. 3 Woooow Mind is blown Mark can you put $10 on the blazers to win it all for me? https://twitter.com/loganmmurdock/status/1128031183600803840?s=21 Rodney with a left bone bruise Basically its a pain thing Kerr is shaking in his boots KD ain't doing too hot Theyre still pretty sick without kd! https://twitter.com/bball_ref/status/1128037246635061250?s=21 Oh for sure space. Still got 3 all stars and an MVP lol Lol josh Jackson arrested for trying to sneak into the vip section at rolling loud too many times Thats gotta hurt the ego Listening to Chris herring and Zach Lowe talking about how Kawhi has nobody else who wants to shoot and I just thought to myself wow cant relate Im in the nba No dude youre on the suns! Yeah the tweets and memes about that are killing me lmao ? Canzano had a good interview with Mighty Mouse today Made me happy when he said he still keeps in touch with Rasheed, Steve Smith, Brian Grant and Jermaine. We needa bring that team back and recognize em at a game Oh and Pippen Next year is 20 year anniversary of wcf team so thatd be pretty dope Wow good call. Make it happen ?Lmao https://twitter.com/shadikaileh/status/1128016049578758144?s=21 Wowowow Inject that into my veins Oh god. Dame already had a "blazers in 6" type comment and is trying to walk it back now He said the warriors are due for an upset and Royce young threw it in an article. Now dame is denying he said that lol Great! Lmao Royce has no reason to keep the connection so he just ran it lmao I respect it lmao Sidebar: Bitcoin is back Shiiiiiiiiiet Really glad I randomly bought 30 bucks of it last week lmao I'm up on Bitcoin what I'm down on the stock market Upside down day Inverse effects baby. More trade wars please! Royce is a thunder guy yeah? Fuck that dude Hes been covering the blazers all playoffs He was there the night nurkic got hurt Fuck that Oval Office cheeto and his Chinese tariffs Art of the deal my ass Gundy that guy deleted the KD tweet. Lol Ruh Roh Lmao Lol who is that guy. Does he know anything I have no idea lmao ? Series prices came out Serious question, how does Portland not have a WNBA team We did. RIP Fire. Wait wait It went under? Id expect it to be the #1 attendance team Lasted three seasons It was ahead of its time Gotta bring that shit back with one gender fluid teammate 2000-2002 Like Matt Bouldin from Gonzaga mid transition Thatd be fire It was kinda the blazers fault tbh Jailblazers and WNBA dont mix? Gundy and Rengel can probably check me on this, but IIRC the NBA was transferring ownership of the WNBA franchises to the NBA owners and Clyde Drexler and another guy tried to buy the Fire to keep them alive but the Blazers werent interested in doing a deal. I think they just wanted the whole thing to go away. I think their excuse was that the offer for the team was well below the franchise fee for new teams so they said fuck it well fold the team instead of recouping some losses I only went to a game I dont remember that aspect so you are probably correct. I went to a Portland power game too tho Did you ever go to a Lumberjaxx game? WNBA started out pretty hot tho and got too big for its own good. Cuz once hype and comets went away they essentially had to start over. Kinda like mls starting too big I did not Yeah WNBA and MLS had really similar trajectories I went to a indoor game In Minnesota- it was sick https://deadspin.com/dennis-rodman-accused-of-stealing-destroying-yoga-stud-1834736113 I live like a mile away from there lol I dont remember the ownership structure of the Fire lol ? Omg Did u watch the Rodman video Its amazing lol https://youtu.be/ZNdkfMnJy_4 Man I want coby white so bad Oof You for real? Undersized chucker? Steph 2.0 Hell yeah! Hes got such a great first step https://theconcourse.deadspin.com/report-u-s-navy-cracks-case-of-majestic-sky-dick-1834738223 Now these heroes can finally be honored at game 3 https://twitter.com/bleacherreport/status/1128294085452816384?s=21 Oh, he gone. Hopefully its in China Meh I think theyll make him a priority I dont always get the jimmy hate He was generally kinda right when it came to shutting on management lol Wiggins and towns dont always play hard lol Yeah just look at the difference between Embiid and Towns reactions to jimmy. Joel loves him He plays really hard too ?Lol yeah take that L on the way out blazers Guys how great is it not to be a poverty franchise and care about ping pong balls tonight Someones jealous! Nah man we the main show baby Have fun with the undercard I will have a lot more fun tonight then you will! Than* Ian its okay I know its been since 96 for you Lolol Hard to remember the feeling of important basketball for your favorite team Thats so true If you guys get Zion That would be sick Or Ja Lol the heat are doomed dude Our best hope is to try and finagle a big free agent https://twitter.com/bipolar_b/status/1128146041621102592?s=21 Anyone wanna gamble tonight? ? Blazers have come down from 8 to 7.5 Vegas high on the zers stealing game one? Blazers are winning the series Whats the finals line at now? Portland is still +1700 Im still sitting on that +3300 ticket from the start of the playoffs. Lets get paid boys Guys we're 8 wins away from being champions If someone wants to throw $10 on the blazers winning it all for me Ill throw you $15 when we win. The playoffs have been difficult for me so I cant make that bet for you lol Ill check my powder in a bit I cooled off after a great first round lol Ill take warriors tn If anyone wants zers Cam get yourself a subway sandwich with all the fixing rather than blowing that money Would be my first sports bet of the year - I think i can spare it ?

Just loving the propaganda lmao You ever tried to go 10 miles from Oracle to San Francisco, BOB? Ramona is reporting the Knicks #1 priority is getting Zion and Shams is saying its trading the pick for AD. Gotta side with shams on this one interesting Pick 2: kyrie kd ad Ramona might be right but I think shes also probably floating Lakers spin If the Knicks get No. 1 the Lakers are out of the AD sweepstakes AD/KD if I could pick two KD and Kyrie AD. The all bitch team Rodney Hood is AVAILABLE Wow now my erection is also available LETS FUCKING GOOOOOO Can erection is definitely making an appearance in the cloud Cam* Hahaha https://www.pscp.tv/w/b6tPMDFsWkVwb3h3TmJham58MXZBeFJXbU5lemtLbFTzWtRHyupdP-3AHhT4kdgGTz99le455UAE2YFPSMUY?t=4m27s Bs rusillo lottery show https://twitter.com/chold/status/1128452006979391488?s=21 Lmao Gary Trent was one of five people to be at Lloyd center one day Giannis with no respect for the Celtics ?

Fuck this Does AD stay now? Seriously ha all good players end in the west, even Murray probably to Memphis Yeah this is so lame I don't think he does He dgaf about Zion. Just gonna steal his thunder Man griffin loves the number 1 pick RJ and Zion getting reunited! A ping pong ball just saved David Griffins job Lol Griff just got hired Yeah and he was already on borrowed time The AD situation was gonna dig him a grave before he even had one season So whats ad gonna fetch God poor knicks All their dreams dashed Ok last chance for Superliga bets! Lol nah Griffin was gonna have a long leash. They hired him to take care of it Yeah this was the only thing that coulda changed AD's mind tho ? So the Knicks get RJ Barret? And Memphis takes Mike Conleys replacement Yes!!!! Wheres Conley gonna go! Lakers! No where What does Conley fetch in a trade?? For the 4th pick I dunno I mean considering the grizz dont even want him A year first rounder tops What! That's a lot man Whoever Gail Bennett sells the Pels to isnt gonna give a fuck about Griffin if he had botched the AD thing Conley old as fuck Late first* They can play together then trade him next year Also RJ and Kevin Knox are the same player Yeah youre prob right He should go to a contender Imagine if he was Lillards backup? The longer they wait Conley is gonna fall off a cliff I would trade him this summer Def They're not winning anytime soon so why keep him Yeah exactly Send him to a team that needs a good backup pg I honestly think hed be sick on the blazers Lets gooooooooooo Just so they have like that true of option Would be able to slow the game down with the second unit Lol isnt his contract like 25 million a year? Alright boys let's fucking go!! Yeah but for one year? He would work on the spurs I mean I dunno I know nothing about their cap situation but maybe its possible Him deroxan and LA could work Good call on spurs Put patty back at backup Or phili and trade Simmonss And Conley seems like the kinda guy that could work with pop Philly is all sorts of fucked That team is going to be so diff next year Lakers trade kuzma ingram and 4th for AD? I think the Jazz wanted him to replace Rubio. Seems like a Jazz player I can see that also chad Conleys not going somewhere to be a backup Indiana would be another good fit I think we can get AD for Collins and Simons probably What about Nurkic straight up https://www.instagram.com/p/BxdsvgVBaoN/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=1wib97rs5kn87 All the sales reps lmao. "We're gonna sell so many tickets fuck yes!!!" Lol yeah all those dudes on commission Ya and in a week theyll be introduced to their new commission structure Justin Lehrbaum worked for the Cavs when they got Lebron back. And he said that they switched to fully inbound cuz the phones were just ringing off the hook "Oh you wanna spend $30k? I'll send over an order" Lines were off the hook when wolves grabbed tyus I thought we agreed on no more black jerseys? Crazy that the most ethical pro-worker approach to handling a massive windfall came from fucking Juul lol https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2018/12/20/juul-to-pay-2-billion-dividend-to-its-employees-after-altria-deal.html Well this is an L Were 0-4 in blacks Whack Draymond was in the restricted area DiscoverOrg better do this shit What a terrible call That's old news space lol Haussecker's buddy works there he got 250k haha That a kid Aminu No I know We're getting to the rim well! I just still think its incredible It is Not a bad take I cant imagine any company I work for Worked Wtf was that moe Elfrid Payton and Zion???????? Giving me a dime of that lol Zion at Bourbon Heat Not a great start for Moe and Chief Nope Moe getting open at least. Chief has to make the bunny What else is fucking new Shams saying AD still wants a trade Kanter needs to get that rebound He should try drinking water We own the offensive paint with this lineup they have out tho Kanter drawing doubles? Lol This is epic Keep doubling kanter! Do they think he's shaq? I'm confused That's 3 times in a row they've doubled him 2 on draymond?? Gimme zack and hood Now Wow that was a gimme for Zach Feeling out period Meyers would dunked it Probing Even the dish to Harkless Sloppy tho Ugh we need to capitalize before they get hot fuck Aminu already with more minutes than last game lol https://twitter.com/draftexpress/status/1128468721843036160?s=12 Did he call that garbage bank Trash ass 3 Story of the first was turnovers Boom! Good ending tho Ill take it Rodney the god Dames gotta slow down If we make 3 turnovers instead of 6 we're leading Ill take that first quarter, tons of turnovers but probably the jitters Yeah he's kinda pressing Lets ride with kanter and Collins vs Aminu I have a good feeling about Zach this series. He's gonna eat Oh for sure We need more dame time God that full court pass was beautiful by steph Loving our defensive approach so far Make things difficult on the splash bros and make everyone else beat you Theyre doing same thing tho lol I think our bench is better Agreed The fact that they start bogut is wild to me Isn't he a vet minimum guy Yeah they picked him up like 2 months ago lol Arrogance! Zach vs bell They should swap doris with mark jackson Australian League MVP Mark Jackson should be banned Nooooooo That was a great move Fuck Jesus Leaning in off one foot Hood played great defense Jesus Jesus two banks!!! Wtf is this Luck Jordan Bell for meyers who says no And theyre only up 7 We good The warriors Us I mean theyre up 7 with curry on the bench And we cant stop turning the ball over They were up 4 when he went to the bench tho and Jordan bell just made a circus shot We're in a good spot Given our track record in the playoffs we are in a great spot. https://www.instagram.com/p/BxdrwzTBmeo/?igshid=bsk8ztpnbnv5 This guy looks like that guy that was on Florida 3rd and 4th quarter team for sure Is CJ on Klay the right thing to do? I think so CJ can chase him Goddamn New Orleans At least we know the leagues not rigged No one wanted that You can crate a theory for every team tho lol Like oh New Orleans got it cuz the league felt bad AD wanted out What would the theory have been for Memphis lol The league did it to give Elfrid a #2 FUCK ET why does he play ? He just won us Game 7 Jesus we can't make easy tip ins How is that not a moving screen I thought the same things Also draymond using both shoulders on post D This is where we gotta make sure this doesn't get away from us If the blazers must die, let them die for the over Its time to grift Take away the two circus bank shots and we're right there Force shots thatll work! Man wide open 3s I mean Bells wasnt that bad Aminu has to shoot that shit Cant let Jarebko go off tho One foot fade-away after his shot got blocked. That was accidental The more he dribbles the worse it is I agree aminu needs to shoot it, but when do we move on from aminu, he hasnt made shots all playoffs Aminu cannot shoot threes right now If we are having that we are done Play Zach over Chief High key ugly ass half Sonya curry could absolutely get it I would love to get her Hall pass candidate for sure right behind TR Turnovers Our defense is on point 3 on klay! 3 on Klay let's goooo If Ayesha doesnt want it Sonya will do Oh wow they gave us the shot on that Fuck Wtf dame Welp Here we are Wow Wow Fuck Great end What a turn of events time to pull your fucking pants up boys 12 turnovers? No more training wheels this is the warriors cut it the fuck out We're a second half team. We got this! https://twitter.com/ericg_nba/status/1128480312089108485?s=21 ^ not great Go home Warriors fan 13 turnovers is the difference https://twitter.com/chold/status/1128482800464580608?s=12 Paul pierce with some great analysis Lmao theyre clearly half and half jerseys Nice tweet Casey! Shoulda passed it to bleacher report you bum! Thats the point, Mark... ? ^ Dubov the consensus from Big J journalists seems otherwise I just wanted Sonya to know how much i care ?? What? God fuck amazon but what a genius ad Gundys tweet confirms my point Yeah mark I think you're still missing the point lol They said they were each picking a side and neither did Thats some polish polisher type shit I didnt realize amazon sold bacardi I stand with the dawg Guys, the jerseys. Front and back Swapped em Say whaaaat ? Like this But hamburger not hot dog No those are both pippen jerseys Mark we know what a double sided jersey is But they said Sonya chose Portland and dell chose GS. They both wore both Neither picked a side I kinda like what they did. The half and half is normally cheesy Well when you pick the front youre making a stand low key Sonya is more of a flip-flopper than John Kerry in 04 They couldve just did what they said they were gonna do instead of being liars who tell lies Jesus fuk Right where we left off Perfect! Thank god dame is cool with the cops I mean refs Dame is the Nipsey Hussle of superstars Building bridges with the cops to build a better world ? Mark you are making me feel dumber than having to read the box to figure what this name meant Yeah I dunno They had opposite fronts Which is what matters! Andrew Bogut is a Proud Boy Nice transition d dame God the margin of error against the warriors is so small Yeah lets not act like weve let it be small Theyre playing like shit lol The warriors should be up more Why are we letting the double work! I mean we're playing pretty good D Were the ones playing like shit Theyre also missing open threes Klay is especially This is just so fucking lame how theyre playing Jesus Fuck You could see that charge coming the second Aminu put the ball on the floor Well be at 20 turnovers soon fellas Lol Jesus Drink every time we turn it over Why are we just sitting back there like kanter needs to get his ass up I cant Ill black out this quarter Pretty disappointed with terry on the game plan there. Every year we've played the warriors we hang back on Curry pick n rolls and get roasted. It's not rocket science We need Moe on him Fuck this dame shit Take a shot! What the hell is dame doing Hes had like 5 turnovers doing that Run it back https://twitter.com/marcjspearsespn/status/1128473063409049600?s=21 Lol he didn't look too happy in the interview after New Orleans won Trade it to NYC and throw in AD for 11 future 1st round picks Cut it to 8 by the end of the quarter and we're gucci Lets fucking go ? Needed that from Rodney Shit swings so quickly Why are we not adjusting on currryyyyyy Especially with Looney behind Steph. He ain't even rolling Guys we could steal this game Yes we can My god lets go I want to fuck our off-ball defense Rodney Hood gonna fuck Sonya curry tonight Which way the jersey gonna face when he does? Well he's gonna fuck her in the ass so he's gonna see his son Steph Guys we're only down 6 points. We can win this motherfucker The warriors blew a 31 point lead. We can do this Love when we make a run once aminu gets taken out! Mark Jackson just compared klays last shot to Ray Allens game 6 shot Gundy can you please text terry about this defense Fuck quinn cook Who is this guy Fucking system guy Dudes trash Let's get caught on more screens And have the screeners defender step up *not JVG makes a good point. I don't see the advantage of playing 10 feet off Bell and Draymond and allowing them to make an easy pass to shooters God you cant win the game just shooting 30 FTs alone. We need to make shots. I thought draymond used to shoot 3s It's not like Collins is doing anything productive when he's sagging off https://twitter.com/dkurtenbach/status/1128495312799068161?s=21 Fade on sight That guy is such a hardo. He wants to be like the losers who do the light years podcast so bad Well could you imagine what this game would look like if we only had 10 TOs instead of 20 So maybe got fuck yourself I feel like this could be a good spot for layman over harkless 30* Dame almost looks in his own head Space why did u make this commercial of this lady laughing at her phone I hate it I hate when I agree with Johnny. C https://twitter.com/johncanzanobft/status/1128496320828755968?s=21 Dude thats it Im done with Dane Delgado. Mashing that unfollow button forever. What he do Smh why even jump at that Is it not a moving screen if you are sliding and moving your ass into the defender as hes running by? They dont call that on them That's definitely a moving pick Aka the Bogut special All of his tweets are just bitching about players bitching at refs or about his students loans i fucking get it dude ?So true Alright time to get the boys some rest I think we still gotta shot Cut it to 8 with 2 minutes left First to 110 wins Can't trade 2s for 3s Goodnight Alright that's it Wow Shitty ass game That sucks Well Im going to bed But honestly I feel good about game 2 Sage is tired of this bullshit It was like the Denver series. We were never taking game 1 on the road let's be real Lets hope terry changes the defense and we learn to value the ball It's only up from here! Game 2 adjustments - "don't let Steph and Klay rain hellfire on us" I honestly thought we were okay on them On the screens with the big sitting back? No not that But off ball ?Put this on the screen and say don't do that next time I thought our attention was great Out help on their little screens in the corner was good The pick n roll coverage is inexcusable tho. Like I don't understand how that ever was a thought, and how an adjustment was never made Laymen time Before the season no one wouldve thought simons would be getting minutes in the wcf That makes me horny Rengel TMI I think we can still win We played like shit We'll be fine Adjust the pick n roll D. Take care of the ball and we're in this shit Game 2 is ripe for a win Blazers in 5 The weak spots are in the armor Whats that called again Chinks! Trump2020! Hahahaha ?????? We got this you guys We played like shit And still had a chance to steal that game I'm 100% with you gunz So is tanking officially over?? Dude huge moment I love it It incentivized the blazers way of team building And the Heat, Ian Even if Miami didnt benefit this time Cant wait till Miami drafts Bol Bol I'm hoping his medicals scare everyone and Portland takes him at 25 Everybody is flipping shit as if there werent an 86% chance the knocks didnt go #1 lol Dude but not just that Bucks are gonna win That was a really weird Klay SVP interview Well at least the blazer fans in Turkey didnt have to endure that loss ?Tighter pants: Ronaldo or josh Boyd? Zion needs to pull an Eli All the players will back him lol Just move the pelicans to Seattle and be done with it This wu tang doc is so good We all watching Stumptown on ABC or what https://twitter.com/cobiesmulders/status/1128397391269388288?s=21 https://twitter.com/anthonyvslater/status/1128514221178671104?s=21 Spicy Terry Shoutout Portland gear https://twitter.com/nbcsnorthwest/status/1128519874123304960?s=12 Lmao I saw that too Rengel Marcus probably cumming himself ??Look at the difference in Bogut defending the pick & roll vs Kanter defending Idk if you can even call what Kanter is doing defense https://twitter.com/errickm3/status/1128482947324088321?s=21 Oliver Maroneys #1 source agrees with us I think everyone in the universe except for Terry Stotts agrees on this Stotts just wants to be a good coach not a great one Prolly a D+ grade on adjustments this playoffs I think he knows too but wasnt going to admit it. If there is no adjustment tomorrow then we got a problem Agreed He's played that same D for years tho Rengel. What makes you think he's gonna change now? Optimism Lol I wish I had some If we are gonna drop we gotta put Moe on Steph I don't get how dropping is even an option? What's moe gonna do to stop Steph in that situation? He still has to fight over a screen in no mans land Thats what he has to do tho and hes better at that than Dame There is no scheme for stopping them and we are not Houston Dude I disagree. If GS can hedge with Bogut, we can do the same with Kanter and Collins Steph will go back to averaging 5 Heres the thing about defending those screens. If youre going over the top (which you have to do), you absolutely need a second defender within arms distance. The BEST case scenario for the guy getting screened is he blocks the ball from behind (maybe 1 out of 25 times? If that?) otherwise its an open shot or a foul on the recovery attempt. 100% Dubov When you go over the screen, you're still a step behind the shooter at best. You need the help defender to be close enough that the shooter pauses and the ball defender can catch up If its Steph on the floor with Klay, KD, and another shooter, that makes it harder. But if its Klay with fucking Draymond, McKinnie, Jerebko, Livingston, Cook, etc. you gotta make him pass/make a play I mean, shoutout to Jerebko for knocking down open shots last night but thats not gonna happen every game. Draymond is the one guy I am scared to hedge on Agree with you on that Gundy Hes a great playmaker from the free thrown line area But I would rather make Draymond beat us then continue to give the Warriors wide open threes Unless they changed the rules, three points are still more than two. https://twitter.com/stevejones20/status/1128651243101085697?s=21 Yeah thats kinda what Im trying to say. You dont have to hedge the screen. Especially on Draymond. But you have to be up and active Steph probably cant even believe theyre letting him have open looks Apparently the players were pissed with terry too Dude he made the most uncontested 3's in playoff history. Lol that's absurd Really? Gimme more deets gundy ?? Wow https://twitter.com/dkurtenbach/status/1128564966947078144?s=21 I really don't like this guy All warriors media already calling the series over Dieter dieter penis eater I even read a story about Jordan Bells new mindset Thats how much theyre feeling themselves Because he banked in a stupid shot yesterday Everything about the warriors makes my blood boil The fact that a team can rattle of a few threes in a row and then heading to timeout go track down a ref to bitch about a perceived slight is so obnoxious This entire us vs the world narrative theyve constructed over the last five years is tired Literally every time I go to New York I see more warriors gear than anything lol But everyone hates them lol Well guys I just logged into synergy to see how we played golden state last time we played them in the playoffs Drop coverage in all three games I watched Told you man. I have images of Aminu standing at the free throw line while Steph hits pull up 3's burned into my brain Terry never should have came out with that coverage and that just makes me even more sure he ain't gonna change it Yeah man Im not sure what theyre gonna do Terry was super defensive post game when they asked him too Can you add him to the group text? A superliga burn room is precisely what Terry needs to change his mind right now Im telling you They just need to move the scheme up the fucking floor They can have the same principles But they cannot be at the free throw line anymore Kanter just has to be in Stephs face coming around the screen but he can still hold him off until Harkless or whoever recovers What made you change your defense for game 2? - reporter

Well I got added to the Sunday Funday SuperLiga, and they were adamant that we couldnt sag off Steph Terry ? If Kevin Love can get up to the level of the screen and recover I think Kanter can too 1000% ?Dame wasn't happy either Zac should start Better perimeter defense Wont foul the smaller looney 5 blocks a game Blazers in 6 ? From Game 6 I just dont know how we didnt get that in the gameplan for Game 1 Stubborn captain at the helm of the ship Aye Terry's been doing this for years man. It's completely inexcusable. Steph is the best shooter in history and you think you can just "force him into a midrange shot". FOH Cant happen in Game 2 Adding Terry now.. ?This is the 2016 playoffs. Look familiar? I was watching the first quarter of that Or no the 8-1 series ?2017 playoffs. Sensing a theme? https://twitter.com/ryan_cortes/status/1128715106936938501?s=12 lmao this gives me life ?This is how we should defend it every time. He made a ridiculous shot here, but that was great D But kanter cant defend like that Was that vonleh? A. There's a middle ground between that and standing at the FT line
B. We could play Zach more But yes Kanter isn't ideal. That was vonleh yeah Kanter can exploit them on the other end tho If we dont turn it over and miss every shot He can be marginally better defensively And it would make a difference Yeah dame was v reckless going to the rim Jumping to pass and shit Mark and I just threw 100 each on the bucks Houman who's winning your playoff challenge Yeah what made Dame so good in Game 6 was he let the game come to him He got into it defensively first Got a few steals Then he got going Whats the line Ian? For the championship? Yeah I mean I assume we won't turn the ball over that much, and Dame and CJ will shoot much better game 2. So if we can shore up the defense a bit, we'll be in good shape We also gotta give dame a break from guarding Steph Its an unnecessary waste of energy We got them at +230 Pretty solid imo I put like 20 on them on bovada after my blazers bet cashed just to hedge lol I have Toronto at like +600 https://twitter.com/draftexpress/status/1128725369224335360?s=21 https://twitter.com/erniep35/status/1128444283332255744?s=12 Wow crazy stat. Dame is the highest drafted player left in the playoffs amongst all stars Dame (6)
Steph (7)
CJ (10)
Klay (11)
Giannis (15)
Kawhi (15) (Minus the injured bums on GS) Wasnt Bogut #1 overall? Not an all star When was CJ an all star? O sorry lol Chad stop making up facts to support your agenda Lmao He's in that tier now Doesn't change the point tho You forgot Brook Lopez (10th overall) how could u Terry Stott's G1 defensive scheme of crazy stats amirite fellas ??? Zach Collins 10 Current all star level players fam cmon This ain't hard Collins not a star
Lopez not a star Bogut not a star "amongst all stars" U taking away Brook Lopez's tremendous 2013 season just like that? All stars or all-stars? Lol All stars means current all star level players Thats subjective Nobody is talking about Vince carter rn when they talk about all stars Technically 1 of Dame's all star appearances was due to injury replacement Just saying And him crying to the media Any other qualifiers we should mention? Can I include draymond or no since he wasn't an all star this year? https://twitter.com/chold/status/1128768840207196160?s=12 https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YwZ2NbvpT50eSKtZlku2KVLQeJ5557H111uTlyHfqMw Ians buddy tom pretty much has it locked up for 1st Damn lol He could still lose tho. If the bucks win I dont think he can I dunno how everything is weighted But youd still be one series (point behind) Oh actually nvm it is possible Space you could win too If the bucks win it's between you and I Anyone want the bucks tonight Yeah Sure Of course $10 each of you. I want raps +7 I believe thats the line... someone double check that Nah that line is too big For me Nah Im good LOL Yall were all about the buck slol Yeah I know but I think toronto covers, maybe even wins tonight Oh I think were getting our brooms out FEER THE FUCKING DEER sweep But 7 points is a lot Fair Houman Gimme them buuucckkkkss Eastern conference finals means $20 minimum Its time for you to act like a doctor Im drawing a line in the sand ? Also the lines 6.5 you fucking goof Lets do $15 Im a poor student still... do you have 300k in debt LOL Oh I didnt know that student loans were due in 6 figure sums and not locked in at a low interest long term rate That said, youve already cracked. $20 at +6.5 it is Low interest rate my ass I wish it was ?? Fuck it mark Let it ride Ill take raps 6.5 $20 Boom That much debt should make your more not less willing Houman What better way to disguise gross gambling debts than rolling it into medical school loans I mean daddy trump only gives me so much to use at a time Need to wait for my next lump sum Toronto just completely flustered right now Bucks are massive And throwing up absolute bricks from 3 Lets go raps God Kawhi is like Jordan Yeah I dunno the bucks always do this First of all the suck in the first half I kinda feel like this is like the Boston game I do too but they were able to stop Kyrie, idk if they can really stop Kawhi Relax Its gonna be way more competitive Yeah Then Boston Lol but Boston was your pick! I know Pascal is showing up early They cant guard him with Ilyasova God bless brook lopez The bucks just need to start hitting shots Raps warriors Warrior in 6 Having Marc Gasol as like, your 5th best player, is pretty sick Someone bet me the series straight up! Okay! Bucks in 4! Bucks gonna cover this game Ill give anyone raptors straight up for the series Up to 50 Dumb question Is TNT and ESPN rotate daily? Like they just split 50/50 days of week for their contract? TNT has ECF and ESPN has WCF But we were on TNT? a bunch Especially during the thunder series The blazers are in the western conference so they cannot play in the ECF ?So what the fuck was this? Not the eastern conference finals Its been like this for like a decade now I think they switch off who has what conference but ya No I know I get that this round Im more talking about whats the sequence in general I get WCF and ECF are their own thing but first two rounds are just random? I dont know how they determine that but I feel tnt has more of the early rounds https://twitter.com/magicstweets/status/1128837404427636742?s=21 Wow brook Lopez! Wow Kawhi with 0 in the fourth Kawhi has 2! Called it Pay up Doctor ?? Zero points Raptors blew that shit damn Fuck me Best defense Ive ever seen Brook Lopez play Any Game 2 plans Portland Superliga?

Yes Watch the video, fought a twitter troll. Caught him full on in the face Guy walked away 20k richer for the same thing? Yea Yah bu were talking about you standing there and he gets a perfect windup And he was PISSED at that guy Lol without gloves would be better Cant hit as hard Without your hands wrapped That guy had a costume on for protection Bare knuckle boxing vs regular boxing. Way more KOs in gloved fights Yeah mark I dunno I bet youre going to the hospital Yeah hands behind your back just standing there while Wilder winds up like DK in smash bros You're fucked No way you just walk away after that Im not saying its going to be comfortable But you aint gonna die Ok And you get 20j You might not die You probably wouldnt die If it was the face? No If a horse kicked you in the face Chest? Yes More people survive than die lol Jeez like not to sound the the biggest snob. 20k is nothing to shake a stick at. But its not worth do anything that will be potentially debilitating Guys hes not the fucking mountain Pussification of America right here boys ?????? I would punch deontay wilder in the chest for 20k easy Wait people are really saying Zion could go back to Duke so he doesn't have to play in New Orleans?? Haha I hope he pulls an Eli Manning and demands a trade I want chaos Is NO really THAT bad? I just think its worse cause he had the chance of LA or NY And all the AD drama happening right now. It's easy to equate the two players and see things ending poorly for Zion as well If the AD stuff wasn't happening right now I don't think it'd be as bad AD will get traded to LA and NO will get #4 and a few others Dont forget Boston has 3 first rounders to fiddle with Windy made a good point tho. He said Ainge has never gotten into bidding wars. That's not his style https://1080thefan.radio.com/media/audio-channel/bonzi-wells-dusty-cam-051519 Great listen Has someone like AD ever been on the market tho? Good interview Rengel. Man first Damon now bonzi. We needa bring that team out in game 4 Maybe it'll give us the spark we need Theyll do something next year and espn will drop the 30 for 30 coming 2021 That would be pretty sick If you get punched in the sternum like that video you could damage your major arteries in your chest coming out of your heart. Its basically like going through a head on motor vechile accident Kobe avoided a head on motor vehicle accident by jumping over the car Can you jump over Deontay? Whats a Deontay Very large black man Whose angry Some would call him a killer The doctor has spoken. Mark you is dumb Doctor has raptors last night, not sure I trust his judgment Anyone want blazers +7.5? Ill take it Mark! 10? We did establish the $20 minimum for the conference finals Even Houman paid it Just dont eat lunch today Then I will bet the minimum ?? Blazers got steamed from +285 to +255 So they got money coming in on them The sharps loved Portland in Game 1 too ? Anyone want Portland? Begone thot! So whats the deal with KD anyway? I think hes hurt You mean besides being a bitch? I think he could miss the series They still havent announced his timetable? He was supposed to be re-evaluated today and Ramona shelburne said hes not close Oh fuck If we get Swept by non KD warriors I'll fucking kill myself They really dont think they need him Who already said they were going to kill themselves this series Suicide pact ? I think it was hoomie I aint worried They are 27-1 without KD when curry plays. I almost would rather have him back to hold the ball and throw off their ball movement. 3 fouls?!! Did kanter go to McKay or what?? Kanter definitely went to McKay Meyers went to Sprague Dame went to South Salem Haha I was waiting for that Dame went to McKay too cmon Evan Turner went to South Medford CJ went to south Did anyone catch Jennifer saying she's been a Warriors fan since 2014 Enrolled in the IB program and ran the school paper Was best friends with Xavier cannefax Zack Collins went to West no doubt CJ was in leadership Rodney hood also went to west. He transferred for sports after he got kicked out of north Blazers hitting Stephs fucked up hand Giving me life Layman definitely went to McNary Were only down 1 guys We got this I officially have a boner Half chub for me Layman lettered in 4 sports Boner wont engage till were up 20 Fucking chief Lock him in a gym and fix that shot Dylan get the lines ready for halftime! Yeah I have a boner But its cause they keep showing Sonya Let's go!!! Its a tie game now I feel good now If ur gunna foul there u gotta clobber the guy ! Its the fucking playoffs! Dame fucking dolla If only we could go 11-21 from 3 every half God Aminu haha Wow. Aminu needs to fucking go Replicate that half Im over this shit What a fucking half tho. Great work boys We look incredible outside of Aminu Gundy text Terry and tell him to keep it up! Aminu looks like...well aminu Aminu also somehow got 9 points Meyers is the only guy on the team with a negative +/- Yeah hes negative 1 house pet https://twitter.com/sportstalkbarry/status/1129209165967237120?s=21 Dylan is that you? Beadle has never heard 3J before? Real knowledgeable host She was being sarcastic Guys Im Barry I cant hide anymore Does Charlie Murphys character from blackish produce these sprite commercials? Does wieden still do sprite tvc? Kanter outlet to Aminu Can't draw that one up This is vintage Lmao ?? Just completely folding Well fuck If only the game was 26 minutes Now were down 6 We got this Drive at Draymond Up 17 Big lead they said The warriors dont have KD were fine they said This isnt good defense ! Bucks in 6 4th quarter Meyers baby Love&Loyalty Leonard he can shoot the three! NOT Meyers was shitting his pants on that 3 Hate is a strong word And then he shit on the dubs Meyers is a fucking pro But it did not take me long to strongly dislike Jordan bell I used to love that guy! Back to hating Olshey: bell would look real good off the bench for us right now instead of Skal glued to the bench Did Meyers wife commandeer Gundy's phone Remember when that guy gave up two consecutive offensive rebounds on missed free throws and ruined our chance at the last shot? Im drinking I believe again Fucking friending for the nicotine gum I left at work You better say excuse me if you bump into me rn! Get the hate out of your heart Meyers is laying it on the line for blazers basketball Lol damn Best leader in basketball Sorry space its not goran dragic I know that hurts to hear Lol seth Wow just give me the sound bite of Van Gundy saying brother on brother crime McChokeum Seth! Sonya is so wet 1 point game This d is atrocious Jesus Christ Why did CJ okay hero ball? Dame with the 4 point play Dame needed to help on that What time is it though? I dont have a watch on Why is Meyers still in? Dame ?? Why was ET in Omg Fucking fuck Iggy yikes I feel like deontay wilder just punched me in the chest What a way to lose HOF defense right there. Fuck This is fucked Man that was frustrating Brutal Were playing with house money Long day at the office today, fell asleep halfway through the first quarter and woke up to that final possession. Wild. Series was going to be 2-2 going back to Oakland no matter what Were still forcing 7 Any games we win its a win... but lets be real we didnt really think we could beat this team. They are the same team basically as the nba highest wins team https://twitter.com/worldwidewob/status/1129233548895019008?s=21 I mean ya but we can dream This came down to the warriors have been here before...like a lot This aint their first rodeo We have the talent to compete Lakers 100% signing Seth We dont have the stamina to compete dylan Good run boys How many times did the guy shooting the ball get his own rebound. How many times did klay/Steph pass the ball away and the defender sagged off then Steph/klay did a juke move off ball and got a good look on offense We dont have the fight in us Too emotionally invested in this team Im not getting off until after Saturday We were down 0-2 in 1977 Until we are down 0-3 we will not relent Nba wants more money and more content of the Currys. Home team will continue to win ^^ love that take ?Me every time Jordan bell scored Zach and enes have to step up Meyers playing better than both is unacceptable! Maite Chadzorla Or never mind that was someone else ? Lmao Wilder once knocked out a guy fully blocking his punches So guys Im about to rewatch the game but my first thought for Game 3: Start Meyers Kanter has been bad in both games He cant post up Draymond Gundy Did you fall an hit your head last night Idk it was hard to watch him down the stretch and Ive been trying to give him benefit of doubt Those alley oops and layups were gimmes at end which he couldnt contest I just dont know what our other option is given Zachs propensity to foul Maybe Kanter will play better at home I just want someone to take advantage of that fucking trap on dame Meyers was good at that last night I'll throw Meyers a bone. That last pick n roll with curry and draymond wasn't really his fault. Every warriors players went deep in the left corner, and have the entire right side of the court for Steph to string out that pick n roll Blazers have to help on that He also had two fuck ups in the first quarter Overhelping on a Draymond drive and missing a box out on Looney on another Yep We can't give up 3 pointers on second chance points. That's debilitating After the missed Looney box out, Klay hit a 3. Then the rebound Aminu fumbled out of bounds in front of the warriors bench, they inbounded to Steph for 3 Yeah I think we are also learning the hard way these guys arent the nuggets and will make us pay for any small mistake Well the good news is that Zach probably couldnt play any worse https://www.instagram.com/p/BxkQC2hl5pM/?igshid=1lud3ieicdxb6 How has he only shot 79 free throws in 3.5 years is the better question Harden shoots that in one series He doesnt get to the line Its one of the weirdest things about his success https://twitter.com/truehoop/status/1129423141846036480?s=21 Wow. Sign me up for that That is the dumbest trade proposal Ive ever seen lol What a great young core to pair with Zion Also canzano called out CJ For going 0-6 in the 4th Lol space what do you think AD actually fetches? I'm thinking it comes down to LA or NY But remember he's on a one year deal I actually think LA has more leverage now than they did during the season How? Well now that their 1st is #4 instead of a late lotto pick. And AD only has 1 season left versus 1.5 Idk I feel like they could get him for something like Ingram, Kuzma and #4 And I don't think Boston will be a player. Ainge doesn't like bidding wars, he didn't want PG on a one year deal, and if kyrie leaves there's no point in trading their young talent Dude the blood clot killed Ingrams value tho I forgot about that. I mean honestly the play is just sell the house for AD, try to sign a big FA. Fuck the young talent when you have lebron Even if they got a tier 2 guy like Kemba to pair with lebron and AD they'd be in good shape Or maybe a D-Lo reunion lol NYK could also trade #3, Knox, Robinson, Dennis Smith and they have two unprotected picks from the Mavs I totally think Boston will be a player I'm calling it now. It ain't happening I mean I guess if you get the field I agree But why not? I don't even think they'll make a serious offer. If Kyrie leaves there's no reason to trade for AD correct? Yeah but what if Kyrie stays? And yeah I still think they do Teams have proven to take risks on guys with one year left Hes a generational athlete Theyre in position to make the best offer Without completely rearranging their core Also The trade machine is so stupid ? What a steal for the pelicans! Th RETURN of ryan Anderson Damn they can trade AD for three core pieces from the 9th seeded Heat or pieces from a team in the conference finals hmm Lol mean they arent exactly your best pieces Maybe they should trade him for Kevon Looney! Simons is sick! And so is Collins Hahaha he played one game And Nurk Dude he scored 38 How many dudes on the Heat have ever scored 38 Collins is fine lol come on you know youre being ridiculous Both of you are ridiculous Dude he played one game! Theres a reason for that He hadnt played a minute in the playoffs He didnt even play college basketball! Those are terrible trades. Why would the pels want any of those scrubs Maybe hes good! Hes a child Oh yeah and Kyle Kuzma is better? Yeah Houman the difference is I know my trade is terrible And I made it as terrible as possible to make a point Id rather take my chance on a draft pick than these guys lol Kyle Kuzma is pretty dope actually Wait Wut? Hes fine Anfernee Simmons is better than Kyle Kuzma now? No Collins is Kyle Kuzma is better than all these players Oh god Youre out of your mind dude Kuzma literally cant defend anybody Can Collins score Not like kuzma but I think Collins contributes more to winning Ohh no he can get 5 fouls in 8 min Ok dont misuse literally and no one else thinks that but ok Put it on Twitter! Zac Collins has more trade value than Kyle Kuzma Ill wait until he has 5 blocks in Game 3 Just like he did in Game 6 against fucking Jokic Collins isnt a theeat... hes a average player. He plays his role but he isnt both physically and offensively at any level of kuzma. And theyre basically the same age if Im correct Collins is younger By a solid two years Fair but I wouldnt compare them. Kuzma is the caliber of Tatum and those up and coming stars Defensively its not even close Hes also getting outplayed by kevon looney He had two bad games Dude he played 8 minutes last night And looney is gonna get paid this summer Collins has had zillion bad games this year Yeah dude this is nuts And? He also looked bad in Game 1 against OKC and Denver? Ohh and lets not forget when he just doesnt play... that has to say something when your coach doesnt play you And then he fucking dominated in both of those series He was in foul trouble It happens Jesus dude Im not gonna lower his trade value off of the first two games of this series after how he finished the last two One question Fine base it off the entire season lol Right now. Youre in the WCF... who cares what team you are. Youre able to pick up Collins or kuzma off the imaginary waiver wire Who do you take Youre literally only basing it off like 2 playoff games And I mean literally Dude he played well in every single win The blazers have had Do we not care about the loses Sure but they had fewer of them! Any team in the league could offer an equivalent of that package or better lol If you want Davis The wins werent a result of him. Lets be real we win if dame/cj go off You have to move McCollum Or if hood does as well Game 7 he had huge blocks and 3s Sure man Collins could drop 20 and If dame /cj have 20 together we lose guaranreee ? Well no shit Thanks Houman Im aware the blazers revolve around dame and cj But they dont make it to the WCF without Collins We dont make it without hood We dont make it there without curry And hes gonna get a huge contract because of it Both of those guys Should we say that curry is better than kuzma And Collins trade value in the league very high I aheee with that Based off what? Well obviously Ian doesnt Potential is very high. Hes young Dude no one is saying he sucks or has no potential Based off of David fucking Thorpe thinking he would be a piece in an AD trade But youre massively inflating his worth Hes a young player, knows how to play. Can shoot, and play D. He needs fill out his body more and he will be good With Nurkic, a borderline All-Star and Simons, a baby who scored 38 points in an nba game already But to say hes basically equivalent of kuzma is absurd Hes pretty close to kuz LOL In value ??????? Yeah nah I think this is ridiculous If kuz didnt play for the Lakers You wouldnt believe hes god Oh Better than Zac Collins Equals god now Collins has won playoff games and Kuz has never been there and you look at me like out of my mind I get scoring is more important But the gap is not as wide as you claim it to be Winning playoff games is a matter of being in the moment. Kuzma hasnt had the chance Whose fault is that? You think Collins could do what kuzma does ever night Kuzma is the Lakers 2/3 best player Hes a great scorer Dude Collins isnt even on our top 5 But he needs to become a better 3 point shooter Winning a playoff game Doesnt mean shit for role players There are plenty of dudes whove won a playoff game Dude but thats how perceptions change Playoff performances mean more to nba people like it or not When youre a star lol Who made this rule? Lol Brook Lopez doesnt matter? What? That game doesnt get him another year or two in free agency? Brook Lopez is a vet whos been an all star Who just signed on a minimum deal And scored 29 in a conference finals game Yeah he signed a minimum deal because hes old Who is a role player on the Bucks And wants to win As players do His career is winding down Brook Lopez is not fetching Anthony Davis lol Are you suggesting that he is? All Im saying is Collins has improved his value and you guys just think shitting on the blazers players is a stand in for actual analysis That package is good You are wrong Lol Well Thats insane But sure No one is shitting on the blazers role players How is it insane if they want a youth movement in New Orleans with Zion? Because they can do way better lol Thats a young package and it has a lot of upside if you believe in your program Gundy I'm sorry I love Zach, but giving him credit for playing sporadically in playoff wins is equivalent to Olshey touting us being the youngest team in the league by having 3 19 year olds on the bench Dude Boston isnt gonna do the AD deal Yeah but you dont think they can do way way better? Success by association The wizards arent I agree there! Boston ain't doing a deal They wont deal with the Lakers Any team could offer at least as good of a package You heard it in the liga first space Name a team Give me a package Throw in two firsts With Portlands And find one that is better when you include Ingrams blood clot and Lonzo not wanting to go to New Orleans Kevin Knox, Mitchell Robinson, Dennis Smith, #3 (RJ Barrett) and a future unprotected first from Dallas Blows our trade outta the water Removed an exclamation from With Portlands Dude any team could Thats one It just depends what theyre willing to give What if Charlotte gives up Kemba and miles bridges and a pick? Kemba is a FA Can't combine players in a S&T Its really not that easy considering Bostons instability and the Nets courting Kyrie/KD and having Russell as a free agent And the Clippers going after Kawhi Ok miles bridges and two picks I guess Toronto could? I mean if young productive centers are so valuable Siakam/OG How about Gary Harris, Millsap, MPJ and a 1st Why not bam? Hes efficient Rebounds Plays great d The rest of the trade sucks is why Oh I know Again that trade was suggested to point out how stupid the trade machine is Portlands aggregation is talent is better than that But fine Jalen Rose is calling Phoenix the winner in a wild card move Booker? Give them bam, Richardson Winslow and a pick First rounder Now thats a trade They could trade Ayton, Bridges, Josh Jackson and they're first But would Miami really do that? God josh Jacksons value I mean I would? All time low Why not? What do we have to lose I mean hell yeah then What's funny is Phoenix had a chance to trade Bledsoe and #4 (josh Jackson) for Kyrie and passed lol If he leaves were in the tank but this roster is always gonna be a team fighting for a low playoff seed at best But Winslow is about to get paid right? But honestly I think if it was jut Richardson and bam and a pick Its still a better deal than what youre offering And Richardson soon? The great thing about Portlands trade is all those guys are cost controlled except Harkless who will probably get less on free agency Someone is gonna take a risk ok Anthony Davis Fair enough I just have to think two guys on rookie deals and a good center at a fixed cost is pretty good but if the Knicks move No. 3 that wins Along with Robinson I dont like Kevin Knox lol And DSJ is still tbd I think we can at least agree The trade machine is not reliable If I can make that trade lol I mean its reliable insofar as the salary cap stuff But not at telling you whats actually feasible Yeah thats true It was like what I used to draft like the top 10 tight ends and centers in Madden 2001 And then trade everybody so I had like randy moss Chad Johnson and Ricky Williams Fantasy draft Madden Was so epic Mike Vick, Randy Moss and Tony Gonzalez all on the same team Winslow bam and #13! Its happening Watching Desus and Mero react to the Knicks lottery made my day Whoa what kinda drugs was Tyreke doing Coke or opioids It wasnt PEDs Crazy that they take blow so seriously I'd never be able to play in the nba Despite the obvious lack of talent I would have a 5 game suspension every year He signed Lamar odem... WHO WAS ON CRACK Holy shit https://twitter.com/kgwnews/status/1129497424114794496?s=12 Damn he's a hero Holy shit that's incredible Sco fucks feels inappropriate Sco ducks Damnit But fuck yeah, thats incredible Oregon Heroes ?Taking that shit to heart HA You seeing shaq starting the Barkley sucks chant??

Goddamn guys A 13 point lead is only safe with a minute left Weve scored like a combine 35 points in the 3rd this series Blazers conditioning coaches clearly were not prepared to be in wcf Dame used to show up in the 3rd Without dame back were fucked Everyone needs to contribute bench cant carry a whole game Dame is exhausted... hes been like that since the 4ot game Are ice baths and 12 hours of sleep just not enough? Hes had 1 good game since okc Nobody was prepared to go this far. Hopefully they now know how much energy it take to be able to play in June for next year We were pedal to the medal all season If were gonna win this game they got to make a run with this lineup Dame needs to call Kyle Lowry after the game Quinn Cook getting better looks than kill Lill ? Jesus Christ please make these CJ ?? What the fuck happened to cj Dame and CJ are shook by the splash bros We are straight up shook across the board Were tired When the best option is a meyers 3.. GS is second half dementors life just sucked out of us Stop Houman theyve played the same amount of games Yah take that take to 750 the game Houman Curry/Klay havent played the same amount of minutes as CJ/dame. Splash bros have been here before 4 yrs in a row. Theybknow how to handle their energy levels Just look at the rbs, lose balls. Blazers dont have the fight they had vs okc Or every player down the entire roster is better than okc Agreed. But if you know that dont you think youd want to work harder. Cause you know lose balls mean more Go home ET youre drunk Thanks for the money space I actually agree with Houman Warriors literally take quarters off even in the playoffs. and we played a 4OT like 10 days ago They have more joy with these type of wine Wins Whelp Cant believe I talked myself into that If we made free throws Yah the bucket brothers dont have that luxury We missed 14 free throws! We getting swept boys 20-33 Welp it was fun while it lasted Jesus Christ We had to make sure we still ended the season with a sweep! We beat the thunder and the nuggets without nurk at least I guess Dieter is my dad now Fuck Durant gone I wish we had a draymond Well KD is 99.9% going to the knicks Yah season was a major success Dont sleep on the 3-1 lead curse Kd leaves and green curry Thompson stay with golden state for career? This series has to be killing Nurkic If green was younger I could see him leaving for his own team but yeah prolly rengel. I agree Rengel God how do they do this Green wont get max but something close to it. Klay gets max The warriors were down 18 This is why the warriors are so fucking good. This nucleus. KD and Boogie just fucking gravy I wouldnt like this team by this point regardless but for them to dominate without them is ridiculous I want Portland to give draymond a max Hed look so good in a blazer uni Hes EXACTLY what we need. Like even a poor mans version is what we need if that existed. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbssports.com/boxing/news/deontay-wilder-obliterates-dominic-breazeale-in-first-round-with-emphatic-knockout-punch/amp/ Dame wanted game over quick too so he could catch the fight Damn tickets will probs be cheapppp Monday God Paul pierce is the worst lol Be interesting to watch considering most were buying at $200+ Monday easily worst night to see a game Plus even if you see a win its still depressing Monday worst day to do anything but go to work. Come home jerk off and cry yourself to sleep Guys I think Dylan is asking us to make Monmouth Mondays a thing https://twitter.com/dkurtenbach/status/1129967205016166400?s=21 Gundy this is the last straw He's stealing ur bit ! Dame has separated ribs ! I knew something was wrong https://twitter.com/shamscharania/status/1129983680489893888?s=21 Fucking looney landing on him in Game 2 But hes also tired Yeah its both If we had fucking nurkic man ? Omg lmao Tim is actually a friend of mine but he totally deserves to get dragged for that shit Thats pretty fucking lame What did he expect against this team? Hes also just doing it for the clicks Its completely shameless And it also alienates fans Its dumb https://twitter.com/oregonian/status/1130021839999082498?s=12 This helps. But if youre the O maybe fucking dont run that headline then.... Kinda cowardly to retract like that either run it or dont Yeah man its like just maybe consider that people are bummed And dont troll them When theyre bummed Yeah exactly Lmao let me know when Tim loses his job Lol the trash brothers is a funny name H should stand by that lol Live by the click bait die by the click bait Law of the jungle baby Fuck that guy. I hate local writers trolling for clicks Lololol Not the best way to keep whatever ACCESS you have. Mark Mad respect for the 5:30 am text Also Do the honorable thing and give me Milwaukee tonight Lol crazy theory here Tell me what you think ?? Warriors intentionally lose game 4 Give Durant more time To heal Take the flop I could see it but I think their series will be over before bucks regardless- so idk why theyd risk injury to others Will it? Does this mean youll give me bucks tonight? I dont bet but I feel Toronto will win 1 at home Nah they got the call from David stern Who still secretly runs the league Time to pack up So whats he telling Portland? Dont matter The warriors went rogue Thats why the wheeled him back in He slowly planted Giannis on the bucks Couldnt make it too obvious Lured kd to the Knicks Come on dude open your eyes Im cool with a good nba conspiracy theory but that aint it Lol Thats what you say at first Until it keeps you up might after night From the warriors side sure but bringing David stern into it is crazy talk Anyway Im fine with the sweep if it makes kd feel unneeded Im sorry Rengel But I see zero proof that Ada silver is an actual human being David stern is def more involved than EVER right now Rengel ? Yah he a gay robot Ive held a door open for adam silver and he didnt say thank you He wasnt programmed to be polite Lets go dubs!!! The nba recruited him from the set of men in black II Brock Please confirm This ear was made in a lab ? You guys I am in a dark, dark place right now Some people just cant handle Nashville Im going on 2 weeks. Help me learn from your mistakes Ill tell you what you shouldnt do. You should definitely not consume alcohols until 4am. Also dont go to the strip clubs. I tried to tell these idiots the strip clubs here suck and they didnt listen. I can do that ? Dubov my theory on Nashville strip clubs was correct? Woah Dame got hurt game 2? Nvm Matt said that last night Yeah dude So shitty Warriors wont have Iguodala so I hope we can get at least 1 Yeah mark ? Live bet! The bucks dont start games well offensively its just a thing ?Ready to run thru a brick wall My enemies Lol I thinks it's like a Navy Seal code or something. Cuz Meyers is totally a seal This game is ?? ?? ?? Yo if youre not watching 2 point game with 8 secs left Choke-akum Brook Lopez game winner? Middlecum V scared of Kawhi rn Bruh Siakam is like a rich mans aminu Lol Like what the fuck What a terrible play I know lol I love this defense tho by both teams This game is for the changemakers No Lowry no Powell Siakum should wear a hijab ?? Go bucks Also low key hilarious the bucks jersey patch is Harley Davidson George hill the god Everybody on the Cavs last year just got way more athletic and way more clutch LeBron really is a drag lmao Also I think Giannis and Dame are the best leaders in the nba Draymond + Steph is a combo deal God I love the WNBA... these ads make me love it Hate the patches . They should at least match the color scheme Whoa Nice. We deserve game seven Game of thrones was dogshit Shut up Dont fucking talk right now My god It was a good ending Fuck yall my power is out Brock spoil it! Dehaan you dont even watch it Im on season 7 now Every scene was brutal. F- ?? Im in sfo Gonna have to watch it tonight at like 1 am ? My reaction to GoT This is what a late term abortion really is https://twitter.com/thekoq/status/1130217564293009409?s=21 Im watching always sunny to reset after I was fine with it but it was no longer appointment viewing after the battle of winterfell imo https://twitter.com/marcjspearsespn/status/1130446291476000768?s=21 Wow Dame killed the tradition smh I used to live right by that, almost went once but decided not cuz the appearance of the outside haha Its honestly fine lol Theres so many other good breakfast places Okay but the fact the players have been going there since 84 is cool. It's the nostalgia factor Meyers is probably putting his order in right now I like that he had to include that pippen is a good tipper lol Pip definitely tipped him to write that Probably haha Magic is just dragging pelinka right now haha this is great drama Dude The Lakers havent played in almost two months and we are about to reel off our best two months on the site lol Magic is a national treasure Also he doesnt even know how much hes owning himself in these interviews I felt like Rob Pelinka was backstabbing me by telling people I wasnt in the office when I wasnt in the office Kenny Wooten leaving ?? Damn. That blows He's a 2nd round projection isn't he? He might have a promise Ya it seems like someone will take him 2nd round and if he has to play g league or overseas for a few years so be it https://twitter.com/JMoneyMikita/status/1130543817508003840?s=20 So hard to watch. Damn I'm Fucking crying hahaha That was cringe inducing haha Dude could barely even get the question out he knew it was so disrespectful Great content for gundy tho Hahahaha Busy day on the content field today boys ? https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1130609253272760321?s=12 That would be a bummer No iggy tonight ? A real pic Holy shit haha https://youtu.be/QoQZ0qmf-mk Mark can you put $20 on meyers being an all star next year for me please G-League all star* $40* Worst nightmare: Meyers plays great in a blazers sweep and gets an extension Grizzlies series 2.0 Dont even put that into the universe Mark. Theyre not gonna do that this offseason- not to upset the masses here but he probably gets 2 more years with us after next now tho They have to at least hold onto Meyers next season cause of nurkic What about skal drogo Meyers sits out the first third of next season demanding an extension, Olshey caves for the chosen one Hes still technically young. Crazy Kanter only turned 27 today too Someone on twitter said Meyers is our Nick Collison. And he's gonna get his number retired lmao So help me god if the blazers retire #11 for Meyers instead of Sabas I will never watch another minute of blazers basketball the rest of my life Haha holy shit so true I mean if they havent done Sabonis yet then who knows lol I dont think Sabas will be ever unfortunately We have the most embarrassing retired numbers. The whole 77 squad got their numbers retired just cuz we won a ship Dave Twardzik: 9/3/3 - 280 games
Larry Steele: 8/3/3 - 610 games 
Bobby Gross: 9/4/3 - 486 games Larry Steele camp is epic tho ?Bobby gross Lillard has to be the next one besides PA Whos the last good wing the zers had Brandon Roy played more games with Portland than Walton or Lucas. Might as well retire his Viktor Khryapa LA will get 12 retired Gerald Wallace count? Maybe Can we retired 30 for Sheed since we already retired it twice? Why not make it 3 Batum and Matthews Specifically 2013-14 Batum and Matthews I dont think sheed would want that Steve Blake better get his retired! The only players I can think of that deserve it are Dame and Roy Mighty Mouse! KAN NOT play kanter Lets push this lead to 13 before half https://www.instagram.com/p/BxtPe_3pU5r/?igshid=1n9r0gs19ctmf Confidence goes a long way Meyers is getting laid tonight for sure Retire his number!!! Write up that extension Niel Its supermax time Moving screen into the shooter BS Well u havent been an all star or all nba so we cant give I the super max but how does 17 million a year the rest of your career sound? Pretty cool honor for Keanon Lowe but you know what honor he didnt receive? Turkey Bowl MVP back in November. That went to yours truly. He couldnt cover me. His beard is so gross lol Keanon Lowe trucked the shit outta me in high school. D1 players hit different Cant wait to blow this lead next half! He picked me off a few times I hated playing Jesuit! He probably never picked off Jack Lorax *lomax I like lorax Step backkkkk What the fuck is going on with Meyers?! Meyers 50 piece?! Omg I'm buying a Meyers jersey rn He just needed to start all along? Mine was already in the cart Chad Dude dame is so lazy with these turnovers Get me the camo one Chad Terry has been holding him back this entire time! They are chanting Meyers Leonard Next time you guys see me Ill be wearing a love & loyalty hoodie Meyers chants Im putting duct tape over my Sabonis jersey This is unreal I never thought I would hear this Bella has risen! Its Easter for dogs Im buying the blessed shorts now Nice job dame Bs call Were gonna score 70 in a half an be up like only 4 ?? Is this Myers team now? 70 in one half, 35 in the next! Meyers might be the leagues best new leader Classic Meyers trade value is gonna be at an all time high this summer Just like Neil drew up Trash Brothers ?? Still funny Ive always seen him in New Orleans..... Never thought Id see Graphics made for Meyers in the playoffs let alone the wcf Meyers is breaking big club traditions Gundy what's the name of the bar right on the east side of the river w good food we went to with fridell NVM slow bar I remembered Slow bar is dank Feels like we should be up 20 Hows that not an and 1 for dame Pelinka is gonna be looking for a stretch 5 for Lebron I think we could part with Meyers for Lonzo Kinda feel like its below steph to be trading 3s w Meyers From 17 to 10 in 30 seconds The classic et to Meyers oop Deja vu Evan Turner needs to fucking die in a fire Its like the warriors need to be down by 15 before they start turning it up 17 to 8 in one minute Dope Terry letting it ride out Love no cj and dame WAKE UP TEZrRY Thank god the warriors Turned it over so much my god This is crazy, 3 games with 15 or 17 pt lead Game Damn so worried about the three Steph wake to the basket for a free lay in I was gonna say something when they got up 17 but didnt want to jinx it Feels like thats the series This just shows how good the warriors are. Welcome to the dynasty. Warriors are gunna easily win the finals 1-Apr You wait and see! Ian I will gamble you rn that warriors will win The finals* Check Bovada I doubt its up Too early Should be tomorrow morning We could do $20 on winner of finals Ill take Warriors Why would I give you odds? When I can get a bigger return on Bovada Which I literally did The hammer!!!! ?? time Im dead ?? ? Meyers game winner. It's only right Here we go Cj Let's go Gotta be Thank god I thought they werent gonna call it Give it to Meyers off the pick n pop He had a shot Lol classic NBA wants a game 5 they let that shit slide all the time I mean that was a clear travel Dylan lol Even though its blatent Guys travel every god damn possession Fair enough though Why arent we going at curry when hes covering cj or hood? I am surprised they didn't call a foul on stephs layup tho Which supports your game 5 point Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh Fuck fuck fuck CJ HITS THAY I thought that was going in Lol damn draymond almost got it That would have been the most brutal ending Lolol Get cj involved. Meyers and ET will lose this game Lol yeah I heard van Gundy too mark A defensive rebound would be tight Why is ET even in? Hes played like shit all game. Completely worthless Cuz ET is our super poor mans draymond Guys, ET plays great defense on Paul Milsap. Hes in their to disrupt his rythem! ET is homeless draymond ET is even liberals dont feel bad for him cause he deserves to be poor Draymond Lol is this about to be warriors ball? Omg this is gonna be another one of those replays Warriors ball No way That touched Klay Nah blazers ball That wa da foul By geeen Or dramond Dame 3? Klay was straight Draymond smushed him Dame needs to pull up from half court Meyers 3 Blazers ball. NBA Illuminati Plz God don't let Evan Turner touch the ball We need to feed ET in a back door to the hoop No iggy !! Gotta be Hood HES OUR GUY Rather have an open Meyers 3 or a deep lillard Only one with the balls for this shot ? I'm thinking Hood game winner Good call mark Pick whoever will fuck your bitch Welp lol what a retarded okay play* Did we want to go home? Why Why was that the best shot dame be like fuck this shit Im tired Yikes Yes Coaching was garbage this series Lol thats ETs fault he shoulda hit CJ flashing Man fuck the warriors Im kinda glad its over rip the band aid off Def a good thing rip city the band aid off. Yikes I wouldnt really want ppl to add that to his playoff highlight reel Lol glass half full! That was a Russell Westbrook shot Floor half swept! Lol Jesus guys dame got a corner 3 for the win lol His drive was way worse Man what a season tho. Proud of this squad ??? If the Golden state media has any guts theyre leading with warriors sweep up the trash brothers Proud of meyers. Lets run this team back. Im sure the pelicans, lakers, clippers and Mavs will all be worse! Exactly like the GoT finale. Wasnt fun to watch it end but you had to. Unbelievable unrealistic character turn for Meyers. Ended will a thud. Meyers was Bran https://twitter.com/bleacherreport/status/1130681243610173440?s=21 Bleacher report coming in hot with the slander Thats just disrespectful with kd How are the blazers getting chirped for losing in the western conference finals Thoughts and prayers Cam if youre with turner Appreciate it brother. Watching that 4th quarter with him was nothing less than unbearable. Kanter/Curry/Hood all gone right? And Aminu Turner Hoenig: Warriors fan since 2013 Tough scene Matty: I just saw dieter chest bump a fellow media member Aminu and Hood are staying IMO Let curry and Kanter walk Turner would be a good trade piece since hes expiring We can pay Aminu whatever the market dictates. Hood I think the max we can pay is like 6 mil but I doubt anyone offers more than that Hood/Harkless/Meyers for Blake Griffin Wait We kind of need Meyers next year man Turner not hood Nurkic isnt gonna be back until 2020 Lol, no one needs Meyers ever Gundy stop First you say Collins is better than kuzma... now youre saying Meyers is needed ET played great against the nuggets for like 3 games, we do not need him So our centers will be Zach Collins and.... Do you just throw our 85/95 games And look at a small sample size Meyers played great for about 100 minutes this playoffs, we do not need him For over 60 percent of the season Houman are you unaware that you need five people to play basketball I agree 100% Nurkic will be back in February wait for it But Myers isnt needed Oh my god Hes going to be on our roster You guys need to look up what words mean If we get Blake griffin we're going to the finals They do need him to start the season like it or not They have no other centers except zach cause Kanter is gone Bill Walton was on the bench tonight doesnt he play center? Guys you know who we really don't need. Harkless I dont mind harkless For 10 mil its not the worst thing He brings some hussle/ size and defending skills that dame/cj dont have Plus Aminu is walking cause Id expect him to get at least a 10 mil deal Im not sure why terry did so much Evan over moe down the stretch ET does create more... maybe he wanted dame/cj off ball I dunno if Blake leaves Detroit He seems to like it there What exactly did ET create besides bad shots for himself? Turnovers So are they better without Durant? I mean the clippers got 2 So did the rockets Then Durant goes down ... Nobody is better without a top 3 player I know but like Whats the other explanation! Theyre a better team with him, theyre also just lazier. They know they can rely on him to get buckets and some nights it doesnt necessarily work out that way. This is real ball vs with Kd its iso ball I dont really like KD tbh, but I definitely want him back for the finals. The $200 Ian and I have on the bucks @ +230 would prefer KD to stay on the sidelines Its a contract year, you cant risk a worse injury! Gundy do you know Corbin smith? Yes dude Corbin is the homie Did I meet him? Was he the guy in Chicago? Did you read his deadspin piece? I did! He was not in Chicago but he hosts a podcast with the guy from Chicago Chernobyl is a very good show ?Dame dropping hints ???? Damn chad https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.hollywoodreporter.com/amp/news/jason-mitchell-dropped-chi-netflix-film-misconduct-claims-1212454 What! Brandon is the best character How's Emmett gonna run the food truck by himself That ig post could be considered tampering right? Two deflating stats for your Tuesday morning 

1. Warriors are the first team to overcome a 15+ point deficit in 3 straight playoff games 
2. Blazers led for more minutes than the Warriors this series The last ones crazy - it was like 100-82 min I think One other thing, when the blazers make the conference finals they usually go back the next year.. Didn't the spurs dick slap us in 99 too And Damon said no team with Avery Johnson as their pg could win a championship lol Ya without looking I think it only went 5 - I only remember Sean Elliotts shot But then we came back as a favorite the next year. And hopefully the parallels stop there I just watched the clip of his shot - sounds like we blew a 18 point lead in that one too haha Damon missed some critical free throws right before that shot God dammit Rengel hahaha Didn't Elliot just comeback from a kidney transplant or something too? Or was that after that series Something like that but ya I cant remember exactly What's sad is how quickly that team was dismantled. We go to back to back conference finals then trade Steve Smith, Jermaine, Bonzi and BG for Derek Anderson, Dale Davis, Wes Person and Shawn Kemp And the magic was gone That minutes led stat is crazy Blazer led for 101 Warriors 83 Yeah chad lol the show is fucked Especially since I think season 2 is done filming So theyre gonna have to kill him off off-screen Damn. Sad day space. That's a dope show https://twitter.com/chrisbhaynes/status/1130849145109880836?s=21 Blazer 4 life When does Meyers get his supermax? **45 million at 35** Worth it Definitely worth it CP3 is getting 45 mil at 36 years old. It's the new nba Uhh so terry might not be back unless he gets an extension And Dames shooting will age his game v well Is what that Haynes article also says Wait would he leave for another team? And longer deal Or is his contract up The team has an option But hes apparently pissed he wasnt extended already I mean terry has his warts. Buts there's not really a better option ? Unless they elevate Vanterpool hire Becky Is this a Toronto dwane Casey situation. Great team but need a new coach to get to the next level https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YwZ2NbvpT50eSKtZlku2KVLQeJ5557H111uTlyHfqMw Google doc has been updated Chad and Tom with the lead. Need to figure out a tiebreaker for the finals Any ideas? Well I picked the Bucks and he picked the Warriors. So that's the tie breaker Well the other series still needs to happen houman True And jimmy is still in it Brock any ideas tho? Well its nice to set thse things before hand I agree but I couldnt think of any Could do pick the total series deficit I like that Youre not really supposed to figure out tie breakers a month into your competition lol I said on the spreadsheet... if you read it. That tiebreakers will be determined if needed If dame really cares about winning, shouldnt he turn down the Supermax so he doesnt take up so much of the cap? Its said that since the beginning of the tourney Its also important that the tiebreaker doesnt have anything to do with your existing picks so that one should be fine Lolol Well I think Im out anyway It's a fair question dehaan haha Giannis turned down money on his current extension to save cap room. CJ meanwhile did not Yea I like it Brock. Pendings ecf Ill message ppl individually Yeah like if we have 70 million combined between cj and dame.... He should just take $35 mil a year and call it a day. Stop being greedy dame Yup He still has his endorsement money... Dehaan I heard you did the same thing at Macys Took a 30k cut to get another person on the floor Lol I wasnt making 40 million a year And dont think theres the cap space like sports Thats not what my managers tell me lol Lol well your managers are full of shit Always love that: if we give you more we have to take it from someone else! They have a person headcount Oh man Ive never heard that before Lol I know I always just get the lost we can do is... Lol maybe Macys did that and thats why I left! And then you always get just like a little more Yah had multiple manager pull that crybaby move. there likeim in such a tough place I only get so much Not my problem I just tell em cut the check Yeah Id be like sounds like you should go talk to HR or your boss, or you shouldnt have posted the job to hire me Straight cash homie But yeah for real it's super easy for us to tell them to take less money but they're making so much it's not a major lifestyle difference Durant took 10 mil less this year to win But this will be dames problem when we cant get other players and he goes 3 for 20 every game Hes already taking less than he could Tom Brady takes less every year, seems to work out for him If he waited until next summer His wife may make good money but still He could get the Westbrook bag Only by like 2 mil gundy Maybe he just wants to make sure we really dont have enough money for LA to come back What's he make from adidas and Hulu? Prolly like 10-12 million? Ahh I thought he could get past 200 M Oh no I was saying he's only taking a 2 mil pay cut per year right now. Idk what his extension would be next year He would unlock another level of payment next years With 8 years of service Im pretty sure #thankyouforyourservice It cracks me up how many casual fans are ripping the blazers for getting swept. If they watched any games they'd know we shouldn't be there. We were playing with house money I'm not a moral victory guy but context matters. Put some respekt on dames name I mean, yeah it sucks to get swept but ??????? How depressed were we after Nurk? I could sit here and make excuses all day for the blazers but we definitely had the opportunity to win those games. We just didnt close them out. Yeah its super annoying when a team overachieves And then gets shit on For like losing to the warriors Yeah literally weve run into the warriors in 3 out of the last 4 years its like running into the bulls They should have got one tho I agree but In defense of the haters They had like 3 huge leads The lakers looked like FOOLs during those come backs lol Blazers* I mean, yes but how is that different than any other team who has played golden state over this era? Erasing big leads is one of their hallmarks. Yeah I know Yah I said I agree But also I think our series in 2016 with them had a similar outcome in 5 games, we had the lead for longer Yeah we definitely should have won at least one of those games probably 2. But still The rockets/clips managed to get a w I can't get myself to be that angry at them Woulda been good to get one Totally but I also cant be mad they didnt Yeah Wear and tear caught up Honestly we are getting back there next year Anyone want raptors tonight? I agree gunz Yeah I think its between you and Denver now? I dunno Houston isnt necessarily going away I think they were prob #2 in the west I wonder if we could get a serviceable player with 2 years on his deal for ET. From a team that just wants cap space the following summer Houston actually did a pretty good job They never got blown out I think thats actually a good chance of happening Chad ET hates Stotts Dragic? I dont support that btw Sucks so many expiring deals But I do feel like hes up for grabs to anyone who will pay that contract I dunno apparently the heat want Conley I dont get it Heard Lowe say Riley will be damned if he lets that unprotected pick be a good one lol Yeah Brock everyone signed the 4 year deals in 2016 lol so not a huge advantage there That theoretical trade partner could have Crabbe or Bazemore instead We discussed an ET for Baze deal Last night after the games That would be helpful Like the ideal guy is a veteran with two years left Conley? On a team thats building around a younger window Yes like Conley Another one I like is Kyle Anderson I dunno Memphis seems to feel they can get a First for him Or TJ warren Would you give a first for him? For Conley? If Im Portland no No way Only because the market is limited Like your competition for him is zero Is it? I mean if you wanna make a run at the warriors Conley still has gas in the tank Youre picking at like 27 yah and not many teams are in the spot where they want to make a run and need a guard Utah And want to spend a first Is basically it Yeah I mean I think this is nuts And Utah already didnt make the deal But people were talking about Miami dealing #13 for him So if im another team im like no one else is giving you a first, have this instead Miami is a little bit different tho cause I think he helps them be in playoff contention which is what Riley wants??? If Miami trades their pick Ill throw my phone in a river Also guys I got a Shaun King RT today cause I put kaepernick in a headline The east or the Hudson? #engagement Wow thats pretty #woke of you Gundy Also I feel like a lot of teams could use him Memphis is so dumb for not trading him earlier lol Yeah and their leverage goes down the second they take Ja Indiana maybe Man I hope dipo returns to full strength People dont realize how good they were before he went down Also I dont think I can pick against the warriors in the finals Its gonna be 7 Against Milwaukee and I think they can still beat them Yeah I mean if like You put a loaded gun to my head Itd be hard to pick against the warriors Yeah But Draymond is better than ever??? They havent been THAT dominant This post season So far the bucks have only lost two games Yeah true And one of them went to triple overtime And its Kawhi The 3rd best team in the league https://twitter.com/joe_sba/status/1130601064363958272?s=21 This is the greatest thing Ive ever seen https://twitter.com/hontheboys/status/1130735469195603968?s=12 ? https://twitter.com/nuggetsnews/status/1130906063299997696?s=21 Am I missing something here? Why the hell would they pick up a team option? Can't they just decline it and workout like a 3 yr 40 mil or something He isn't worth close to that If they dont pick it up hes an UFA, right? Yeah but they'd have his bird rights. They could decline and re-negotiate Just seems odd for Milsap to have that much leverage. I can't imagine any other teams wanting to pay him that much Who wants Toronto tonight? 3.5 ?? Low key thinking about getting an Anfernee Simons jersey I thought he was part of that AD package? If we have him into next season Then I will get a Simons jersey Gotta keep the options open Multi year extension for terry Oh baby You gonna text him our congrats? Already did lol Wow!!! https://twitter.com/jamiehudsonnbcs/status/1130940500045778944?s=21 Jody Allen!!! No sale! Hell yeah SAINT JODY THE REAL JODY HIGHROLLER JODY DROPPING MORE BAGS THAN HULU Jody Allen highkey has a donk Lmao mark I just laughed out loud on this conference call. Good work. ?This shit is so lazy lol our season didn't end in demoralizing fashion. We were never beating the warriors Except for those 100 minutes that we were Except we were never gonna win a 7 game series Lol I know Im just being a jackass I mean it was gonna be Warriors in 5 at the very best for us if you thought different youre a very positive fan And not necessarily realistic Or Charles Barkley The ringer also being dicks The national media has been wrong about the blazers for years tho its been so much of the same today I like that everyone is so negative this is what is great about this team is that theyll continue proving people wrong. Theyll be in the hunt next year and who knows what happens when the deadline comes around We just gotta be competitive into the deadline The ringer cant think of any other alternatives other than trading your star players Right? Such lazy click bait journalism Thats because their overlord just wants to fire up the trade machine any chance he gets How did nobody write about this being justification that dame and Cj can work together and win? Should be the standard sentiment but would make for a great contrarian take with all these losers still saying break it up The ringer NBA slack must be the most obnoxious place on the planet Its crazy also the last two rounds for us dame and cj didnt play well in the same game really In terms of scoring It was one or the other CJ was the best player in the Denver series. Yes And Dame struggled I hate saying that word its not the right thing Yeah its just that he was great against OKC and really good against Denver Yes ?Whats Steve Blake doing on the team pic?? Hes an assistant coach bro Hes like part time I dont think he travels Hes also not at games but he is always at the facility The magic Johnson of assistant coaches Wow idk how we completely missed Danny Cobbs birthday yesterday. LinkedIn just let me know Im a bad brother. Do we know yet how long the extension for terry is for? I will ask him later if we dont know I dont wanna bother him tho He also wouldnt tell me most likely Ask how much dough Neil gave him too! Yeah ask if you can hold the bag Terry is probably already on the golf course And turned off his phone Ok so if I understand everything weve talked about: Meyers, ET, and Moe are going into their last year. Were gonna give Dame the SuperMax. Is Aminus contract up? And Hood was an expiring? Kanter is gone? And Terry took Extenze to go golfing? Man none of you want Toronto at +3!? Hell no. Bucks are gonna crush. I already lose enough money when I try to win I dont need to throw money in the garbage Lot of former Blazer greats available in free agency this summer. Can we sign any of these legends and run it back?

Allen Crabbe (player)
Ed Davis (UFA)
Robin Lopez (UFA)
Channing Frye (UFA)
Nik Stauskas (UFA)
Jerryd Bayless (UFA)
Tim Frazier (UFA)
Noah Vonleh (UFA)
Raymond Felton (UFA) Like we gotta at least bring back my man Ed Can we afford Bojan Bogdanovic? Most likely not So are we gonna let Aminu walk or nah? Whats he gonna command? And we can have either Curry or Hood but not both? I think we could get Aminu for like 32/4 Maybe even 28/4 Because he likes it here Brooklyn is gonna try and get him but he would have to wait for them to try and sign stats *stars Is Kemba gonna go to the Nets I think Kyrie It would be so Kyrie So then Kemba to the Knicks? With KD? That would be perfect honestly Or maybe KD to Brooklyn And Kemba to New York with x lmao I would love to hear the next desus and mero pod after KD signs with BKN Can we afford Marcus Morris? Yeah I think 4/30 or something for Aminu would be clutch gunz And then Hood for 3/19 if he'd take it Kanter and Curry are prob gone I wish we could get Marcus Morris It would be a great fit if I just dont know how we do it Why we going to pay aminu that when we cant even play him in the playoffs? Cause we need help getting there and he usually helps us with that Also Kawhi Going all out I think its kinda weird that drake can just pace the sideline and give nick nurse shoulder rubs https://twitter.com/danfavale/status/1131024975597580288?s=21 Thats amazing Fair point dehaan He was terrible Yeah I mean I see he helps us get to the playoffs but you really want to pay someone 8 million a year to make your team worse in the playoffs when it matters most? Yah I agree dehaan It also might seem worse since him and harkless play together and are essentially same player with no shot I think they gotta keep hood Yup Fair enough Need more shooters, that frees dame and CJ up Lol had to do it ? Lol gundy you are the expert, just see it as another bad contract that well probably regret That drake thing is awesome What if the Portugal the man were allowed to homebrew on the sidelines during the regular season? Yeah just the issue is we have aminus bird rights and if we lose him we only have like 5 million to sign someone else Oh so I guess free money for him then yeah? Like doesnt hurt us to sign? I want hoods bird rights :( Yeah not having hoods blows But maybe we could give him like 4 years/20 million? Or 3 years/15? Via the mid level? I need to refresh my cap shit like whats the market for Aminu? Cap enthusiast chad here All we got is the taxpayer mid level which is 6 mil with 5% annual raises. Can offer 4 years total I think we offer the full thing to Hood Sign Aminu with bird rights cuz it's free money like y'all said If Im hood I resign for a 1/1 player option for line 10 a year, like a baby Durant deal. Secured him a little cash and if he puts up 20 pts for a season he can go get a 4/80 Then fill out the rest of roster with minimums Thats honestly not bad for Hood Idk how many people give him more I agree gundy Maybe do 3/20 with a player option if he kills it he can opt out Shit if we got hood tho for 3 or 4 years for only 5 million a year??? Steal And Dubov I can't see a huge market for Aminu. I feel like 8 mil is his ceiling. But all it takes is one shitty GM to set the market lmao Someone could give him 12 and fuck us oh like a Rob Pelinka? Oh lebron and the captain on the same team??? ?Here's the deets next year BAE might get us another Curry type guy this summer but that also hard caps us for the year To say that the salary cap controls costs and benefits parity is the biggest lie perpetuated on the American people since they tried to tell us Biggie was dead How much do you think Curry gets on the market? Probably like 5-6M/year Hes gonna go to the warriors when Klay leaves on bad terms and theyll have shirts that say the real splash brothers Thank gd the raps won Now we will have at most five days without hoops Ill take Klay in red and black Put him at the 3 Lol I just rallied all my sports gambling (Bovada and superliga) Im plus 15 bucks Tallied Damn inside the nba won 4 emmys Amazing I was waiting to see the blazers go fishing Thought they were going to make Shaqtn Man Im gonna be pissed if the commish changes some west coast games to 6pm. Fuck you New Yorkers!! Id be so happy Finally can watch these games Or at least a half Just met with Derrick White's trainer. Your boy may be coaching at the Derrick white skills camp next month Coach Chad! Holy shit. Wild Chad! I'm trying man! He's inviting me to some shoot arounds to make sure I know my shit first. Just had coffee today ? Hahahaha I'm dying Thats incredible Chad! Thanks dude! Maybe text terry and see if he has any tips on what brand of whistle to buy? Maybe some good coaching sayings to sound like I know what I'm talking about Keep your two best players on the bench for the first 3-4 minutes of the 4Q when you're in an elimination game Ill see if he gets back to me He did but he called me Eric, feeling that new contract ignorance lmao Dame got an all defense vote lol Irrational blazer take of the day from BlazersEdge: "let's trade Turner, Meyers, Trent and a 1st for Blake Griffin" Sounds great ???? I'm sure Detroit is all over that one Lotta expiring value there Essentially a win win for both parties ? ?Is there a worse cap sheet than the Cavs? Lol that's a luxury tax team next season Would you want Klove? On blazers I would wait Until the deadline I wouldnt do it now tho Like lets wait and see what happens with Detroit and stuff I wouldnt pull the trigger on Love when we could potentially get Blake or something better with our experience *expirings Like Anthony Davis you try now But love is one you wait for Do you believe in love after love https://twitter.com/iamshanemorris/status/1130704462950076416?s=12 idk if you guys read this yet but its entertaining. Dont believe it for a second but I enjoyed it. That is freaking crazy lol quite a story Yeah Im not sure I would have re-wrapped it with a book. Haha Im not sure I wouldve tweeted out a story about how I scammed MS13 Yeah better point, hopefully he created an alias twitter account! There is probably already a bounty out for him Thankfully were building a wall to keep them out so that guy is probably safe I like how he also said how they looked like gangbangers once he saw them...who did he expect to be coming across the country for the van? Church group? Probably expecting somebody that looked like JBurr that lived in his van Yeah Feels like fiction to me Hes sitting there getting chewed out by drug dealers and hes cracking Tom Clancy jokes? I mean I think a lot of criminals fuck up on the reg but Oh I see you found the bag of expensive drugs! Great hustle friend! Now that I know youve found and touched it And used it to (extort?) 5 grand from me I will trust you completely and not test it Dont hate the playa! Thats definitely not how it happens in the movies! Wow space u sure know a lot about ms13 huh I fell for a stupid scam once! Took me for 250! All nba teams are announced later today let's go Stephen A Smith voted dame first team Dame over Curry is closer than people think. That said I still think dame gets 2nd team Steph, Harden, Giannis, PG, Embiid
Dame, Kyrie, KD, Kawhi, Jokic
Russ, Beal, Lebron, Blake Griffin, Gobert That's my guess Is this a regular season award or not? Thats where its tough Did lebron play enough games to justify 3rd team? Yeah that's the biggest question. Could go either way If you take Lebron off then you drop all the way to Aldridge When did ppl vote? During playoffs or before? before Too bad not right after round 1 lol Yah thats why lmao Anybody that votes for Lebron for any of the teams should have their vote permanently taken away Dubov depends on your criteria doesnt it The All-NBA Team is an annual National Basketball Association (NBA) honor bestowed on the best players in the league following every NBA season. He did average 28/9/8 tho. Only question is did he play enough games All the other drama is irrelevant I mean by the above criteria he could sit out the whole season and still be first team lol Lol true Was he one of the 15 best players in the NBA this season? yes Definitely Man I really disagree with that Right But thats the Dubov school of thought You cant think of 15 guys that had a better season than him? Which is legit It doesnt say best season Says best player But you can def legit say that that means best season and be totally logical lol ok then they should just hand out the award the day before the season starts For Lebron yah prob lol For forwards it's literally lebron or Lamarcus If you'd rather have 21/9 Lamarcus then sure Thats the other thing. It shouldnt be based on positions. But lebron still put up massive numbers I think the all star game shouldn't matter about positions. I like the 24 best players regardless of conference. But I feel like all nba kinda needs those parameters Center is kinda outdated tho. It should be 2 guards and 3 front court like the ASG does I kind of think the opposite almost Chad This shit is rigged. Look at this Like all NBA should be 5 best period ? The fix is in man and you could see over years whether it was guard or big dominated or whatever When I search first team all NBA look what comes up idk A list of Lebrons awards I honestly dont even know whos a forward or guard or center Giannis is a point guard. What is he listed as? Hes a forward I think But like as Chad said, its either LeBron or you drop to LaMarcus or Bojan Bogdanovic Id go Ben Simmons over LeBron but I think hes a guard Positions are dumb lol Guys are essentially getting penalized for how tall/short they are, regardless of what they actually do on a basketball court. Idk Dylan I guess I just see the all nba teams as the three best teams you can make from the seasons performances. And if you just had 5 guards on one team that doesn't seem right Where as the asg should reward the 24 best players regardless of position since it's just a stats award anyways But chad we just learned from Brock its not about the season, its about the player. He's being facetious lol What the hell why did the Wings waive Megan Gustafson?! Nooo..Thats the team I got in that bleacher report quiz Well theyre falling apart I got the Mercury but I wanted the Aces https://twitter.com/vicbergeriv/status/1131305275326062593?s=12 ? Wow damn Jokic over Embiid Second team would beat the first team straight up Third team would be hard to watch PG over KD wow I guess he was a monster though I feel like if your team doesnt make the playoffs you shouldnt be on there. Like would you rather have Jamal Murray or Kemba? In a game? kemba Suck it Dubov The fix is in tho. Klay didn't get picked so the warriors can keep the team together Can you imagine if the nba all team voters had a spine? It would be remarkable. Oh no Lebron James is gonna be mad at you? Hes too busy on set at whatever hes filming today to care about you Lol dude 27/9/8 Lebron first team snub! Speaks for itself Ridiculous! So you think if nuggets had kemba Brock they just torch us? Murray was pretty absurd I mean kemba had an amazing reg season Murray also sucked a lot of the games int he playoffs TRUE Obvi Im taking Murray going forward Very streaky Yeah Kemba gets some pity votes also He played 57 games and lead his team all the way to... Darius garland? Media always have a bleeding heart for guys going about business the right way on a bad team Guys that are there for the #rightreasons? Steph made it playing 51 games last year Were you mad about that? Kemba didn't make the playoffs Consistent outrage is needed Dubov Yeah I thought that was crap Hey personally I dont think being on a playoff team should matter at all but the NBA community has decided that matters Lol Marvin Bagley got a 3rd team vote FOH Wow KD out for the start of the finals I still think they are better off personally If they beat the bucks or raptors without him I wont feel so bad Thats bet case scenario Best Basically would put him right at 0 earned titles Yeah if they win without him hes for sure leaving Giannis is now eligible for the biggest contract in NBA history lol Last year would pay him 54 million lol NFL media is so upset Thats a lotta tzatziki Lol that video of Klay finding out he lost 30 mil Hear me out. League wanted him to miss (so warriors could keep him on a more affordable contract)

and Kemba to make it (so Jordan couldn't afford him and he goes to NY when he isn't offered the super max) The fix was in Oh wow I actually like that conspiracy Chad just so funnt In no way does the supermax help the team its completely backfired Now that Game of Thrones is over, does that mean Game of Zones going to end? ? Wouldnt it be hilarious if berry tramel voted russ first team all nba Danny Kannels best example for why weed is bad https://twitter.com/dannykanell/status/1131672088392151056?s=12 Stay off the weed Michael Phelps definitely wasnt motivated to succeed He was only motivated by the free subway sandwiches Angry Klay Thompson in the finals Have we seen the last of KD in a warriors jersey? He may never play for them again Lol makes me so happy Go warriors ?Also crazy to me that Kyrie only has 2 all nba nods. And worse career stats than dame. Yet people think Kyrie is so much better Hey Dylan Bakkens wedding is next weekend, you crashing this bitch or what Please go and make a toast! Lol where is it? Down in McMinnville or whatever I feel like I'm the LaMarcus Aldridge of wedding festivities. I'm never gonna be a unanimous pick, but you get towards the end of the list and you're like hmm yeah he's good enough to round us out Suffice to say I was surprised I got invited to this wedding but I'll be at the bar with Mark Im gonna be so goddamn drunk next Saturday and it aint gonna be at Bakkens wedding. My spurs in the champions league final and my timbers first home game of the season good lord Im gonna get so drunk Ill have a lisp Oh fuck yeah ? Fresh picked kale from the garden Youve gone full blown PNW Lmao wait Bakkens wedding is in McMinnville like Dylans? ?????? Yea he said he really loved Dylans venue Oh my god lmaooooo Lol nevermind its in Hillsboro Thats kinda like McMinnville Goddamnit lol Lol Coulda been next level content Pascal Siakam is just 1.5 Aminus tbh. Maybe 1.25 Pascal Siakam is Aminu with a higher exchange rate Are brothers going to Oregon-Auburn I most likely will I am leaning towards going I need vengeance I cannot unfortunately. Going to Austin the week after. Oh shit Im going to Boston that weekend anyway. Im dumb. How do you guys think blazers would do vs these teams Lose In 5 though Not sweep This game tho You think either of them push warriors? I mean why not? They both finished with better records I think we could make it 6 We beat each one At home And the bucks clearly have issues with small guards Kyle Lowry is racking up numbers!!!! Records are not comparable for east vs west IMO Bro thats so 2017 You think east and west or even?? Get outta here I think the rest will hurt gs in first game I mean remove the warriors? Whos so tough? Id say the 8 playoff teams vs east having 4-5 solid teams Yeah I agree space. Spurs are weak af. Jazz basically are an east team. Rockets would dominate the east thats about it Outside of these 2, phili, Boston and maybe Indiana? Spurs beat 5-8 playoff teams in east Blazers and nuggets would prolly finish 3 and 4 Detroit made the playoffs Blazers can win the west They suck TRUE Period And they finished 2 and 3 in the west? Orlando made the playoffs right? I dont think Houston can be a better regular season team than Portland Yeah thats fair How about Ill take 4 games vs Detroit over 4 games against Spurs or Jazz The regular season is a joke And it doesnt matter We will be 1-2-3 But it also does Regular season matters in fantasy football! If we didnt have more wins we play golden state in the 2nd round Did gasol get away with the hold? Wow totally did That was a pretty big miss Has him hooked Brogdon such a dumbass damn Wow is Toronto going to get over the hump??? Leonard might be staying in the north I think he stays no matter what now Series aint over tho Portland was down 3-2 too What a horrible timeout call The refs really suck rn Toronto deserves the win Kawai deserves a depleted warriors matchup after that Zaza thing Wow Brock Thats so true Still not over tho! The 6 in six Yah def Also actually possible Kawai wins the finals with the raps Leaves anyway Loses to warriors in 7, joins warriors After holding 3-1 lead Kawhi winning the ship then going to the clippers would be such a kawhi move Exactly Heard it here first I can see it Whoever does it gets to go toe to toe with LeBron to run the city ? This is not the beef I was ready for in 2019 Is that the bucks owners daughter? Or is it Giannis girl Bucks owners daughter She wearing a drake shirt? I tried to get Matty to peep her in Vegas lmao He missed it Nah its an Aston Villa jersey https://twitter.com/vnnetsrak/status/1131763089462956032?s=12 Thats a little too far. Was she sitting by Rodgers tonight? Yeah that weird man Like if she was wearing a drake shirt I at least get it But how is that an own Im thinking about banging your young daughter! Yeah Drake as soft as a soggy graham cracker Thats like some middle school shit Wasnt she wearing the pusha T shirt?

SHUT THE FUCK UP FUUUUUCK Welp RUN IT BACK CJ and Dame SUPERMAX time Does anyone else like CJ for Ben Simmons? Not the sixers Are you sure about that Ian? KOC russello and BS like that for sizers Simmons is 22 Maybe if Portland sweetened the pot Yeah but he cant shoot Yeah I know its not crazy So throw in an expiring? Throw in meyers Nah first rounder Playoff reps Cj and a late first rounder Feels fair okay Ill throw in a first round pick which is basically like the 27h pick Yeah I mean I think Ben Simmons has a lot of value But I Could also see that trade making the sixers better right away Not sure but possible And theyre in win now mode Defense matters! I think CJ would be savage in the east on offense Yeah I do think you guys take for granted how good of d the bucks and raptors play Its not all just guys not being able to shoot Damn I hope we get a game 7 in the east Yeah but CJ instead of Simmons they win that series Lol wut Its not like lowry wouldve just torched CJ he chokes in the playoffs anyway You cant just say that I just did! Its been said Olshey is just a fucking hustler my god How much does he get paid Death. Taxes. Trump and Olshey. https://twitter.com/jordanuhl/status/1131971225851445250?s=21 Shocker Yeah Im not surprised at all. What I am surprised by is that he created a GoFundMe?

Aminu coming in at #3 Solid Lol sorry cam You read that in reverse No i understan As in he is 3rd to worst its great1 Oh lol Sarcasm! I see Still a big advocate for text messaging sarcasm italics. Yeah but wouldnt that ruin it? Man one narrative to make this nba fun Is that Kawhi is secretly the best player in the league And the only time the warriors played him full strength in the playoffs He dominated them Brock touched on that earlier But he beat Lebrons super team And Gould have twice Should have Maybe the warriors are just like the rockets winning without Jordan! Poor one out for Dwayne Casey man Pour* Yikes Man, think if wes doesnt bust Achilles and that team stays together, with CJ coming off the bench the next year, that team would have been so good So throwback time Reminder: the rams didnt score a TD in the Super Bowl The rams were in the super bowl? Fuck your mothers, both of you https://jalopnik.com/elon-musk-says-hyperloop-tunnel-is-now-just-a-normal-1835024474 Stick to space Elon http://twitter.com/XXL/status/1131984068772597760 https://twitter.com/playoffmars/status/1131926400653357061?s=21 https://twitter.com/enes_kanter/status/1132332802316234752?s=21 Gundy I saw your RT yes !!

We the north As long as KD misses some wins its good either way Raps arent gunna be able to guard these warriors Splash brothers > 3-1 was bad but 2-0 is pretty dam bad Kawhi revenge game for the zaza undercut Series **** Wow raptors Me and space are done If was a hot take Jimmy takes the lead with 19 Well I guess good thing blazers arent in cuz enes wouldnt have been making the trip Man pretty annoying Zero could def had Leonard for CJ and Zach we agree? Zers But the chemistry would have been thrown off Brock! I wonder how coach pop is feeling right now Im not sure cjs stock was higher than derozans in that instance Anyone want the raps line Whats the raps line? CJ is the same player in the playoffs that he is in the regular season The same could never be said for retozan Derozan Ill even give you +4 lol Its -1 warriors I mean the blazer havent been any more impressive than those raptors teams Just lower expectations Winning in the west is harder You gotta factor in the fact that toronto believed they could keep him Look at their numbers Derozan is considerably worse in the playoffs Well a Oregon duck is going to win the championship this year Dog the blazers killed it this year but at that point theyd been swept by the pelicans Lowry has stabilized Ether bell or Bouchard lol Look at career playoff numbers CJ and Dame are the same player in the postseason as in the regular DeMar was always worse By a lot Patrick Mahomes is currently at the restaurant Im at. Ask him if he thinks tyreek is guilty or innocent. Ask him if Milwaukee is more diverse than Portland Wait Dubov You know ray palonco? Yeah Ray is cool That's baller. I follow him from afar Dudes a sneaker legend RayPPhotos Lolol Legend Yeah I met him through some of my adidas buddies Eric Church just played four fucking hours lol Where at Dubov?

You could bet 14:6:2 on curry:kawai:dray and profit $5 on curry and push if the other two win https://twitter.com/muhammadlila/status/1132705598632538113?s=12 the shot at Milwaukee in this thread is unnecessary. Clearly hes not familiar with the diversity there. Dame hanging with a boogie gives me life Wow Cam turner moved out?

Ahhh Bedroom Whoa ol Gotcha Thats wild Man the As rattle a few wins in a row and all of the sudden a guy thinks he can get his own place The demonization of carbon dioxide is just like the demonization of the poor Jews under Hitler, said the physicist, William Happer, who serves on the National Security Council as the presidents deputy assistant for emerging technologies. What the fuck Gundy that pelinka thing you tweeted is crazy! Right !? Also the fact that Baxter had to have a league source confirm that Heath ledger was dead before he saw the movie is the greatest thing Ive ever seen ESPN has to have an additional source to post a verifiable fact that makes Kobe Bryant look bad lmao Im def here for this magic is a huge asshole angle magic is a bitch. You think ppl were back stabbing you when you were a player. This is what Shaq would call some pussy shit Werent* Are you able to see his tweets? The tbt team is not happening and Im pretty sure he blocked me after let me know lol https://twitter.com/MadBuckets I cant see that account either? O ok strange The sad thing is the lakers saga is pretty much the story of how our country is being run right now You could replace the current storyline on HBOs Succession with these storylines and wouldnt miss a beat Can I get a tldr? For starters, Pelinka made up a story that Kobe saw the Dark Knight and asked to meet with heath ledger to pick his brain after he saw it lol Thats one anecdote More specifically that Pelinka set up the dinner and it happened lolol You really gotta carve out some time for that story lolol Worse disaster: Chernobyl or the Lakers? Lolo I need to watch last nights ep man it was tough to watch. Shit gets extremely dark. Yah made the mistake of watching that right before bed Same We should start calling each other comrade ?RIP - dicks out today in remembrance My sweet prince Gone but never forgotten Also thank God he died one day later or we would have had a vets vs memelords situation on our hands Only thing worse than 9/11 is 5/28 Why aren't there Air Harambes yet ?

The only things I couldnt stomach were Swiss steak and the chicken cordon bleu szechuan chicken! Those cordon bleus were from Albertsons freezer section Yeah I know and they were fucking terrible. ???????? Jesus Christ What awful meme-ing What was even the attempt here Meme?

Have u? God In 7th grade we had to design a personal logo - mine looked like that but with an R. The teacher hated it. How did his team land on that ?Shoutout to this promoted tweet lmao Honestly thats a perfect promoted tweet God JVG is being comforting and soul crushing about the blazers at the same time on the Lowe post today If they hold on to that lead in Game 2 that probably goes 7 Gimme a break Lol how can you even say that? His logic is if they win game 2 they at least get one of 2 at home lol just passing along what he said If they hold on to that lead in Game 2 that probably goes 5 Fixed I could see 6 in that scenario cuz they probably win game 4 too Why would they probably win game 4 But who really cares at that point Why would you probably beat a team that has won 12 playoff games in a Row against you in any game When you lose 2 games like that in a row its pretty deflating Yeah real deflating for the raptors Yah and 3 times its probably for a reason The point was if they pulled out game 2 tho Easy Brock, it's called momentum Crazy how much momentum the blazers managed to misuse three games in a row Like Dylan alluded to throughout the series - a 14 pt lead is essentially a 5 point deficit Dual Threat Pod had a big thing on Pac 12 football and Larry Scott today. Russillo went in on him its worth a listen! Yeah it was interesting And infuriating Larry Scott can eat a dick The fact that he gets paid almost twice as much as the SEC commissioner is hilarious It really is lol He was so promising at first but I think that was clouded by Oregon dominating in football Oh baby its official I'll be coaching at Derrick Whites camp in Denver June 24th-27th Trying to decide what nba coach I wanna model my coaching style after Avery Johnson Lebron James Woah magic Johnson coached? Did not know that Sorry just googled worst coaches of all time Removed an exclamation from Oh baby its official I'll be coaching at Derrick Whites camp in Denver June 24th-27th Ya after he was a late night host I would say Red Auerbach You know Just chomp on a huge cigar and make veiled racist comments Idk Lavar Balls not bad This europa league final sucks. Both teams should lose. We are taking this home baby! Azerbaijan is Chelsea turf I truthfully hate to see arsenal fall apart in a big spot The real kings of north London dont play until Saturday Its gonna suck to lose Hazard We are also on a transfer ban until next year lol I cant believe its an all England champions league All England UCL and europa Woah Okay 3-1 Unfortunately Chad is not Jewish enough to be Red Fair I say Rick Adelman Chad, pride of Chemeketa What about Jackie moon? Dress the kids up like seahorses and starfish and make them do a choreographed dance. Ooooh good call gundy Learn all about the corners offense God now I wanna watch that movie I love semi pro So underrated This is amazing lol https://twitter.com/complex/status/1133796630942113793?s=12 Does anybody think AD could actually stay? Or is this still just a leverage play by Griff Yeah definitely The pelicans have demonstrated theyre not afraid to ride it out That would be the save of the century if they could resign him Honestly their cap situation isn't even bad. They'd have max room next summer and could add to AD, Zion, Jrue and Julius Randle ?Starting 5 and sixth man who you got Curry mj wade lebron Durant KG Wade is prob irrational God I hate these But Im gonna do it! Russell, Kareem, Magic, Jordan, Shaq, LeBron Its like am I doing legacy or actual best team Russell prob wouldnt even be that good now You pick 1 from each decade Wilt and Russell were sick dude They could play today imo Lol space you didn't follow the one rule Wilt is one of the most athletic people ever Wilt, Pistol Pete, Larry Legend, MJ, Tim Duncan, KD So you think curry is the best pg ever space? Yeah I'd go Magic, Jordan, Lebron, KG, Kareem with jerry west off the bench Wilt, kareem, bird, Stockton, harden Ohhhhhh 1 each decade Sixth man curry Yall sleeping on pistol Pete thats at least the 2k team id want Russell, Pistol, Bird, Jordan, Shaq, LeBron Wilt, Kareem, magic, Jordan, kg, lebron Jordan and kobe cant play with anyone else though is the problem I considered Barkley in Jordans spot basically if you have Jordan you need magic or lebron but then you cant shoot Prime Barkley was amazing and unselfish I dunno Jordan played with pippen But I think Jordan is just better on defense and all around And it worked beautifully. Jordan and Bird wouldnt work IMO Instead of going best I was more thinking better team that would actually play together well They would figure it out bird is a genius I know so was I Russell Kareem Isiah Jordan and Lebron You wont score And both are competitive AF I have shooting troubles I hear ya See youre team is amazing space I have curry off the bench I feel like pistol and curry would be a lowkey sick matchup Tie game tho you get to give the ball to Jordan tho I feel like wilt and kareem you could literal score two points every single play and outbound any team My team would get all the rebounds and would have amazing help defense I have the GOAT MAGA team though. 
West, Pistol Pete, Bird, Malone, Tim Duncan with Joe Ingles on the bench
 Ted nugent does halftime show I didnt see Joe ingles. Ill swap him for LeBron No HAMMER?!

He brought in nurk and hood Went to the conference finals Honestly I think the best chance of landing a star for our expiring contracts is next trade deadline This summer will be hard but next deadline Id say, Blake or some other star with a lot of money isnt working out Is a chance Spaceman noted Neil Olshey apologist Btw raccoon dog was top phrase on google trends for a good chunk of time yesterday Lol Im just saying pat riley gets touted as this mastermind All hes done in the past 4 years is give massive contracts to Kelly o, dion waiters and Tyler Johnson ? ? I agree gunz Blake should be our top target Wild card move: Dame and CJ recruit Jimmy Butler hard this summer. He gets the sixers to sign and trade him here Meyers and Moe see ya That would be iconic But i think jimmy ends up with the Lakers Did y'all see Ric Bucher reporting that Kyrie is deciding between the Lakers and Nets? Nah jimmy staying put Him and embiid are peas in a pod I think Jimmy is gone Would you do something like that for Harrison Barnes I would have last year but he somehow made the Kings worse Idk anymore Its also the kings Yeah also idk why the kings do that I mean Harry B in Aminus spot does sound pretty great Im coming around to it I feel like since its the kings they would take some expiring deals for him - hes get 25 mil but its only for a yr Yeah I would try to wait the pistons out But why would they want expirings if they could just let Harrison expire Ya thats fair idk - Im just thinking of guys dame and CJs age that could help fill holes I just dont think we need to rush this summer to make a move when a much better move could be available when the season starts CJ and Dame can get us to the playoffs With anybody around them lol https://www.instagram.com/p/ByF4Fi4HruC/?igshid=1uuiuz30zp6az Jesus ESPN BPI has Raptors with a 61% chance of winning tonight This is ok for a first draft Gundy Word on the street is mariota put on 13 lbs of muscle?

He actually has 6 rbs already Wrong Green! Doh D. Green haha Raptors up 1 with 4 minutes to go in the first half Pascal has 20 Siakam is a beast Next on first take: Is Kawhi the best player in the league? Best game of the playoffs For Siakam Dont do that to me Gundy Doris looking like a snack Next on first take: is Siakam a superstar? Spicy P putting up Hammer numbers 79-70 with 3:25 3rd q Now 79-72 raptors Rengel 1:38 left in the 3rd. Doris still looking hot Must be staying with Aubrey Idk these girls on the flight to Nashville might give her a run Anybody else surprised Nick Nurse is 51? I thought he was some brad Stevens young buck Nick Nurse is a snowflake cuck Prolly voted for Hillary...twice He travels to road games with a guitar His logo is worse than meyers ? Damn raptors They going to hold on? Up 9 with 8:25 left wow Raptors down 3 they got this theyre at home 12-0 run by bell? Things happen Warriors who? We still got a game boys Never count out the grew Great* steph Time / score? 104-94 with 5:18 Warriors aren't mentally tough enough Tell me again how the east is trash? Are you going to tell us Miami won the season series vs raptors ? 106-94 4:42 left I cant comment cuz I cant see it but come on Ian - its one game 9 point lead 2:35 to play bunk Thank you ? KDs agent calling him after the game telling him to sit out the series Nah this is perfect for KD. He comes back in game 3 when they're down 0-2 and wins the series for the warriors. He's the hero. Rides off into the sunset with some dignity Boogie get in? Yeah he played. Looked real slow KD to the raptors The next chapter The raptor chapter God that Gasol trade mid season was so money Raptors up 1 bunky They might hold on Yeah boogie played he didnt do much They didn't give up shit for him Jonas and a couple warm bodies Boogie is the Antonio brown of the NBA I am happy i hedged my Celtics bet by betting the raptors after the first game I saw them with Gasol Headcase who aint winning anybody shit Masai has some fuckin balls Gasols passing is just such a difference maker Siakam also low key good passers Its why we missed Nurk Raptors win by 9 A fan in a Dell jersey was talking shit to Steph as he left Overreaction time! Cant believe you would lie to me Dylan I was giving you the actual score Not the one on the espn app Love drake and draymond chatter I dont have the espn app. Everyone on the plane hates me now after I yelled out that update Where are you flying?? You headed to Canada for game 2? Are you going to a bachelorette party? Pascal siakam has like a qualudes accent Or are you headed to Portland for Bakkens wedding? Dog its not just one game He sounds like nick batum on horse tranquilizers Trying to theres like a group of 15 - all dimes Tell us why dawg Its that the top 4 teams in the east are toronto, Milwaukee, phill and Boston Philly East is top heavy Sure whatever but the top are the only contenders Phillys trash The top would all make the playoffs in the west Ian But 5-8 would be like only better than the suns and thats it When you have under .500 teams making the playoffs don't tell me the conference is better I mean sure but Yah i two of those teams lost in the second round and only one of them even made it to the finals Jazz-clippers If you wanna say the east has more contenders, sure that's an accurate statement Are not real contenders at all Ok yeah thats what Im saying Thats the norm in the east - ever since the first lockout Fair point I think everyone agrees with that space I mean kawhi, Gasol and jimmy went to the east on teams that were already good Ok sooooo If you went 1-8 vs 1-8 east valley west the west would beat them 6-2 I think Houston could make finals if in east and the bottom of the west just keeps getting better And same with the bottom half Seriously why are we even talking about the bottom half The road to the finals is harder in the east Cause you said the east Nobody in the top four of the east would have a problem That is absolutely false Omg thats so not true! Wut 6 of the teams in the west Fuck off When you say the east is better you're talking about the entire conference Yah no With So hard LeBron did it 8 years in a row I mean There was no kawhi and Giannis hadnt ascended? And lebron is the best player of our lifetime Also Denver was the two seed... They were good as fuck! They won 54 games Denver was so good dude They were totally but I think they were a bit like The raptors pre kawhi Theyre the deepest team in the league arguably You had 6 teams win 50 in the west Denver could beat Milwaukee Ok Rengel Youre officially not worth arguing with Dude Jokic was incredible The lakers would go like 7 games verse the pacers The kings might even sweep the hornets Yah the clippers are smoking the magic You think the blazers beat Milwaukee? The Kings would beat the pistons and magic easy Clippers also would be filthy in the east Your arguments are very subjective and could go on forever I think the kings could beat the pistons Lol wut? You think Denver could beat Milwaukee that is OBJECTIVELY stupid I think blazers or Denver could beat the sixers or bucks Not completely- plus theres no real way to prove it Then youre an idiot youre gonna somehow make use root for the warriors just for the sake of this argument ?? Portland did beat down Philly both times they played This is genius Ian Well Jokic is gonna finish 3rd in MVP voting. They ain't trash Please do! Philly is more like Toronto pre kawhi than anything They aint trash At all Space and I were the only ones to pick against the warriors don't forget Jokic > Embiid But they also needed 7 against the spurs and lost to Portland Bandwagon is full sorry Lol I did too but I picked Boston so I dont think I get credit lol Only money if the raptors win Good thing youre not a gm Vegas has the Celtics as the 2nd favorite preseason ?Guys this is so SF it hurts

1. TV on top of the fridge cuz no apartments have living rooms
2. Not watching the warriors in the finals but probably has "Go Dubs" in his Instagram bio Also I know this is crazy But maybe Defense is important? Okay thats far enough Ian Ian we get it, you only watch the eastern conference Lol says the guy who think the blazers and nuggets could beat the bucks Also can I ask you Rengel Why do you think that? If the blazers are in the east Thy run into toronto in the second round and lose 4-1 Didnt say the blazers could Ok so you think the nuggets are better than the blazers then? I dont get it I agree that the warriors with KD are the leagues best team Ainge is gonna blow it up watch But the following 4 Id contend are in the east You can make a good case that that still makes the west the best conference I mean they could try and go for AD or Conley or something but theyre kind screwed But the elitism has gotta stop lol Bc the warriors are whats propping the west up at this point The rockets I think would beat the raptors If that was the finals That spelling bee was lit I mean just like Why? The rockets arent that good dude Paul is over the hill The east definitely improved but the west is still better I just feel like we should throw out non contenders personally Did the east get better because LeBron went out west so teams loaded up ? I think thats mostly coincidence Actually I think its the opposite I think teams built their teams slowly And isnt swing for the fences Bc they were waiting out lebron If anything Siakam > Giannis I mean I love that take lol Well the east and west are down to one contender each But its nuts lol Giannis cant make a fucking free throw And the east is up 1-0? Did Cleveland beating golden state in 2016 mean the East was better? Overreaction game 1 content is the best Well hold up Gundy ? How does that make sense? If the warriors arent the best team The west has no case lol Because their regular season and playoff paths were more difficult? Yeah but none of the top 4 in the east would have lost in the west https://www.instagram.com/p/ByHOEADFFxL/?igshid=1220b6cnmdo85 Hey question If the bottom half of the conference matters so much Was the east better in 15-16? ?? Worth noting the cavs won that year Can we do the siakam kawhi aisha meme? Replace kyrie and bron ?????? Either way we can all agree go raptors And no Ian the east wasnt better in 15-16 Like Memphis was 42-40 but pushed the spurs that year in the first round Did anyone read the Iggy article by Bucher today? It was pretty interesting. He said basketball isn't fun for any of them right now He said it feels like the Olympic team. They have to win or it's a failure Holy shit brad calipari is entering the transfer portal lmao Yeah but by the metrics your applying for this season it was? Also lol What the hell are you talking about? ? Gundy Stay off the weeeeeeeed In what world is coming within single digits (9 lol) once in four games pushing the spurs Thats a pretty good take! Oh my bad it was the year after That was when Conley and Gasol were hurt When San Antonio played golden state and zaza fucked Kawhi They went to 6 against Memphis In the first round It was the last Memphis run for z-bo and Tony Allen Lolol I mean I assumed For what its worth I think the west was Better that year But were either including the bottom half or were not In conclusion Deeper does not equal better It did tonight! Lol I think the records are hard because in division they play everyone more Ok soooo ? Then that would go both ways I thought the east had four chances to win and if the conference is weaker the records are better. What was the record east verse west games This season verse others But they were all underdogs against golden state And probably would have been against Houston I dunno where youre getting this Houston nonsense no line would have favored Houston over Milwaukee I mean Dallas went 15-15 against the east this year If Houston beats golden state that probably changes Or its at least closer to a coin flip Boston went 14-16 and Brooklyn went 13-17 I mean Miami kills it against the west and we suck How did the east do against the west overall? Milwaukee wouldnt be as favored as GSW was coming into this I dont think Only team with a winning record not top 3 I wouldnt be surprised if the warriors do the raptors like the raptors did the bucks Get smoked in the first 2 games then just rattle off 4 straight Yeah I wouldnt either Every team had winning record against east except 4 teams Iguodala getting hurt again is worrisome tho I didnt say that? I said against Houston lol I dont even think this is. Lose Warriors still -150 favorites on the series Close* What was the overall record east vs west? No but I mean relative to the spread in this one Well 3/12 in the east had a winning record and 8/12 in the west had winning record Milwaukees line vs Houston wouldnt be as high as Golden State v Toronto or anybody in the east So the math isnt even close There are more than 12 teams in both the east and west Please tell me more about math! Knicks and cavs went 0-10 each lol But again I think my entire argument here is deeper doesnt mean better I mean look tho ?? NW not entire west on knicks sorry but still funny The blazers and Denver being good this year throws it off and makes this illusion that the west sucks but coincidentally both those teams killed the east. I mean they killed the bottom half of the east Which again I dont think should matter as much I guess I just feel like we usually would say deeper was better in the 2000s Im not sure it would be different now with regards to conference strength but I get the argument for focusing on contenders I just dont necessarily feel that way Yeah I just got off the plane. Can we all just agree the west is better I need to see what happens in this series I think if toronto wins they solidify the east I think this is going 7 Durant or not What about matchups tho The have the best two teams record and point differential wise And the champion like the raptors could just match up well If Durant doesnt play... we will never know Bring back the east v west all star game 2, 3 and 4 best teams are in the east I just also think if you rank the best players in the league more of them are in the west Kawhi stays if Toronto wins right? You think Gundy? You think philly is better than blazers and nuggets and rockets Ian? Giannis, kawhi, embiid? KD, Steph, LeBron, PG, Dame, Jokic is pretty hard to top Draymond and Klay Anthony Davis Warriors
Raptors
Bucks
Rockets
Nuggets
Blazers
Sixers
Everyone else in the west
Suns
Celtics
 Theres your power rankings. Good night I mean kawhi, giannis, embiid, jimmy? Lol the sixers are so much better than you guys give them credit for What do they have to do? They pushed the raptors to 7 And lost on a miracle KD, Steph, LeBron and PG? Or disaster depending on who you are No I know Swap Anthony Davis with PG But Id say the two most valuable dudes in the league rn are Giannis and kawhi Well I dunno Prob kd Just saying the east stacks up I think Steph or KD Steph is like the Babe Ruth of Basketball I just hate him lol Yeah I mean I dunno Also man What if is kawhi? The east is better than theyve been in a long ass time Happy? Sure I cant believe pascal Siakam I dunno man the raptors have been very good for a while now and just got the ultimate upgrade Also look what healthy kawhi has done Went to 7 against the heat CJ for Anthony Davis its time Lost in devastating fashion Then dominated the heat Or James Harden Led a 67 win team Sat out a year And is now in the finals up 1-0 The blazers with nurkic could beat anyone in the easy East Dude do you believe that? Dude Nurk was the key I still believe that I said it when he went down Thats what made this entire run so insane You would have maybe went 4-1 instead of 4-0 Come on now Hes a great passer dude and he improved so much as a finisher And an amazing defender Hes a good player man Like he accentuated everything perfectly The fit is ideal But a lot of teams have at least one significant injury Blazers maybe edge out the Celtics with Nurk But no more Well ok scratch the maybe Blazers are 4 in the east with Nurk The raptors just came out in game one and punched the warriors in the mouth When was the last time the warriors lost a game 1? This was not fluky either Steph did his thing and the raptors dominated hroughout Throughout I agree with Dylan The raptors have the matchups Theyre the most athletic team in the league Ok so who dont they have the matchups against? What does that even mean? Blazers were 6-2 vs bucks raptors Celtics and 76ers Looks like they were good against top and bottom of easy Lol remove the Celtics? 2-Apr And go point differential You said east top 4 better than all west Besides warriors Ok hold on Yeah I think that Ian you also know by know you cant just blanket point differential on everything and call it good I said top 3 And I think that I mean then you cant just go blanket record? Look at the rosters Philly is stacked! If anything theyre underachieving I think you can weigh both and how they did in the playoffs Blazers +38 those 8 games And that includes 1 of the 2 losses by 43 points Ok remove the Celtics lol Because thats what I said... Lololol Ian we kicked Phillys ass twice +27 then Pretty sure by at least 25 both times Yeah but you lost to Miami twice? If your reasoning is 76ers are stacked, the fucking Celtics are STACKED I think the Celtics are good I wouldnt call them stacked Well Miami is undefeated in the playoffs Yeah talk about underachievers Embiid and jimmy are both better than anyone on the Celtics The Celtics were one game away from the finals and then added Kyrie and Gordon Hayward Jimmy also got worked in the west I respect the blazers but to say theyd be the best team in the east after what you just watched is nuts on the wolves Oh so last season counts now? How did the blazers playoff run go? Well you were just talking up jimmy As good as Miamis, lost round 1 Saying the Sixers are better than the Celtics? Yeah Miami is trash lol This doesnt offend me I have eyes lol I love the heat but were completely hopeless right now Boston had more talent than anyone in the east but Philly was a better team And technically it wasnt as good Be the heat won a game against a team with a better record lol I think that Boston take is nuts Kyrie isnt elite Hes close but not their Cavs dont win the title without him Those three teams ahead of him had a riot generational player Yeah thats true Oh wow now we are talking wild takes Lmaoooo Well Ok So define elite Come on man he had a bad series His first bad playoff series really Kyrie is top 5 PG Kyrie is good but hes not in the same league as giannis, Kawhi or Embiid Thats not a hot take at all And hes their best player I mean lets not bring the elite thing to the nba lol But Tom Brady is the only elite sports player right now To me its too 10 Top Is Kyrie even top 20? I would say hes top 15 He was 2nd team all NBA Ehhhhh pushing it but maybe Fair Lets see What pgs would you rather have? Steph, Dame, Russel? I mean none maybe not even Russell Shit Id rather have Murray than russel lol But like I dunno how thats relevant? Kawhi, giannis and Embiid are in a different league I would call top 5 players at their positions elite Than Kyrie No? Prob not but this is turning into an argument about what constitutes elite Lol Which is not the point lol Gundy said Boston had the 4th most talented team in the east Most* I think they had the 4th Gordon Hayward wasnt what we thought hed be Thats where we end up saying Jrue Holiday is elite Marcus Morris had a career year tho so that balanced it out Tatum was the biggest disappointment East player rankings:

Giannis
Kawhi
Embiid
Butler
Healthy Dipo 
Kyrie Ok swap dipo and Kyrie lol Fine But still the Celtics are not the most talented team in the east I thought they had the most 1-8 talent But it just didnt fit And they hated each other I also dunno what Milwaukee has to do lol at this point for you guys Ok Im dumb whos dipo Lol oladipo Milwaukie about to be a totally different team next year Man dipo isnt top 10 in the west Middleton could get a lot of money Yup and Lopez maybe yeah? I dunno dipo is such a hard dude to evaluate For sure He was washed out on the magic A bench player on the thunder Everyone washes out on the magic Exploded in Indiana Took Lebron to 7 The pacers were dominating before he went out Im not convinced dipo isnt too 10 on the west But its really hard to judge him He was kind of a passenger his one year in the west with Westbrook going for the MVP Man what is Russ now? Top 20? I think Russ can redeem himself But yeah this year was ugly He might be the most interesting player heading into next year If hes even healthy by then Also wouldnt the raptors be a nightmare matchup for any guard driven team? Like they would give the blazers/rockets the same troubles? I dunno Kawhi, Siakam and Ibaka Are just so formidable on d ?

We had a friend in grade school who got in big trouble and had to go to a private catholic school for middle school and then he rejoined in high school at South and we'd play pickup basketball and he was bouncing it off our heads and dribbling through our legs and shit and he'd never been good before so everyone was like wtf. Turns out the professors brother was the PE teacher at Salem academy so he taught him a bunch of sweet moves lol I went to Willamette b-ball camp and he showed up. The kid from the Portland episode Computer Chip was in the camp too. And we forced our friend to play him one on one in front of a huge crowd. The kid was like 10 and we were 13. He was doing all the and one moves while our friend was doing the moves we learned in camp Wow Looney with a fracture Out indefinitely https://instagram.com/fox46nick?igshid=1p0ew16ujgs08 Have you guys seen the weather man that copies pro athletes swag?

Also Utah is interested in DAngelo Dion Waiters AND JR Smith? this beach aint big enough for the two of them CJ Harkless and picks? They cant get a better player right now than CJ right I can't think of anyone. Unless Tatum is on the table and they want potential over current talent Tatum also had a bad year lol Right they can def get more potential for elsewhere He was bad this year Yeah but I think his potential is still sky high Sophomore slump Just saying only advantage zers may have is they can give that raps offer Good player right now It all depends too how much Griff like RJ barrett If you can pair two top 10 players in their prime you gotta roll the dice Zach anfernee and 2 first rounders? I think we gotta include CJ or Nurk. They need a blue chip in the trade PG and Kawhi on 1 year deals both fetched all stars https://twitter.com/clutchpointsapp/status/1136052190504611840?s=21 Wow https://twitter.com/fox10phoenix/status/1135985034857345024?s=21 Lmao funniest shit I've seen in awhile Lmaooooo Thats so funny Omg I feel so bad for laughing Omg Hahahaha 45 seconds in grandma was like fuck this just let me die here ? Kawhi's shit talk lmao Dunno if satire or not at this point Ya a lot of things most ppl who play say during pickup You frequently say "board man gets paid" during pickup? You dont? This confirms what we already knew. Autistic people can get really good at something Kawhi is really good at having large, strong hands Maybe not that but at least the first few like give me that 70% of these things ppl say...

I cant remember the accolade exactly Is there any reason with Looney out and Thompson questionable not to put all of my money on Toronto tonnight? Yes! Have faith in the warriors, this is the time for the other guys to shine... plus no one knows if anyone outside of Leonard will really show up especially away Also its the last time at Oracle I think Toronto can hang but golden state is coming out with their hair on fire Mark u want gs? +4.5 for Toronto is pretty good tho Oh yeah thats a good bet https://www.oregonlive.com/blazers/2019/06/nba-draft-a-look-at-the-portland-trail-blazers-and-the-no-25-pick.html Lol this is sad I want dubs -4.5 Omg Meyers joined faze clan I'm weak He needs an out strategy ?

Oh... Oh wow no Klay Smash mouth has changed Refs showing their colors early Hell yeah ? Also top comment on the Terrance post had me weak ? Filipinos love basketball and guns more than Americans They also love regressive drug policy more than Americans Steph learning what it feels to be like Dame Omg if this turns into omg we would have beat the raptors if we hadnt gotten swept by the warriors Im gonna have to rejoin the liga in August lol Im just saying Steph is seeing how its like With only two other elite teammates What dame sees all the time Not saying we beat Toronto Yeah I know where this is going! Dame had Cj Cj played like an all star Who does Steph have right now offensively Steph has Draymond Green, Demarcus Cousins and Andre Iguodala Andre, green... youre high Gundy I agree with boogie, but boogie isnt Cj Cj is Klay level But Portland has nobody else that is Draymond or Iggy level I feel like Steph is in a similar situation https://www.instagram.com/p/ByWUIxMlaS7/?igshid=wq1tgwov9bgi Steph gonna cover https://twitter.com/worldwidewob/status/1136431723640741888?s=21 Lmao!!! He had to poop!! I would take Klay over CJ So would everyone lol But the point is Dame has like a legit second option Who can draw defense and go one on one Steph rn does not He has Draymond Is Draymond a legit second option who can draw defense and go one on one? Good player yes Yes Ian I was responding to Houman who said cj is Klay level But not that Dehaan Im saying they are the same level... as in they can score on their own, shoot amazing ? Crafting his retort And draw players to
Them Id be fascinated to see CJ and Steph no Klay and dame and Draymond no CJ Draymond can knife thru a defense like butter ! So can Collins according to Gundy Whose better than kuzma according to Gundy lol Would you guys trade cj for Draymond? Re question Real* Nah daymond would not put effort in in Portland Yeah I would I think Guards grow on trees Lol dylan Dylan stop Moves to central Oregon Becomes a republican How many air balls has green had this game Starts smoking meth The cycle is complete They have enough talent in aggregate that its really close to what the blazers are If im correct its 3... and they were wide open 3s He is from Arizona after all.... You can focus on individuals True colors ... Etc etc Recency bias Draymond is so good The warriors still have high end talent Dylan u a big Sherrif Joe guy ? Even with these injuries But Brock is right he wouldnt try as hard in Portland Gundy id say offsenvily no, but defensively yes Also Draymond was a champion at every level He was just fat He impacts winning Draymond is pretty unreal like his impact on games Yeah that was actually a legit questions Robert horry won 7 ships Question His energy at times cant be matched I was referring to the guards at a dime a dozen comment and CJ is great when dame is cold but like draymond literally energized the whole team its kind of crazy hes relentless Draymond anchors his defense and runs the offense, robert horry literally could never Theres so many good guards space what do you mean You can supplement the replacement value I guess is what I mean Draymond would be fat in pdx The gap between CJ and like an Eric Gordon or name a random starting guard is not like the gap between Aminu and Draymond And Aminu is prolly in the top half of starting wings? Thats my point Damn I kind of agree there Thats fair Im not saying apples to apples hes better than CJ. CJ is unreal I dunno its hard to know But he offers offensively what 60 guys in the league can offer I respect what youre saying Whos the last good wing the zers had But I also wonder If you swapped draymond with like a justice Winslow What would happen to both Draymond literally won them 2 games last series What ! I get we rolled over and we suck blah blah blah Miami would be the best team in the division This took a turn lol Lol well the magic won our division by two games Golden state wouldnt be the same at all So Thats not like Saying a lot lol Draymond really is the glue Otherwise theyre just the blazers I think thats the legit separation You would at least make the playoffs and probably be a top seed Im what Um Golden state has Durant lol Before Durant The heat would be a top seed? Draymond was always the extra Oomph Hahahah this is insane Home court For sure Yeah the east is weak af ?? Hahahahaha dude thats insane Were trash take KD out of this Wed have to beat out Boston They won without him We would not have been better than Boston with draymond lol It would be a lot closer than it was Draymonds impact is elite level in terms of plus minus Between the heat and Boston!? And any other advanced metric you want to apply Hes like all the good parts of kelly olynyk without the bad ones Bro the heat arent good lol Being a better Kelly olynyk is not a huge sell But like imagine I screenshotted this If everything olynyk did was better, but most of all IQ and motor Draymonds motor is the best in the NBA period Wed be like the 6 seed lol And we could have been the six seed The east isnt bad One question: how many people took acid tonight in this chat Draymond would make you a lot better I feel like its >1 I wish I did You picked the Celtics to win the championship and bet me theyd beat the bucks I just had tequila Youve never been wrong Ian? No lol I just watched Fox News for an hour so Im basically high as well But now youre saying like So then what does that prove? Tucker Carlson is my anti-drug The Celtics are garbage And e heat would usurp them with draymond No way! Im just saying Steph is seeing what its like to see how Dame is guarded Theyre not garbage but Draymond is a fucking giant Basketball arguments are the best You are inferring I think they are trash when its truthfully my respect for Draymond What!?!? Draymond is good but hes not drawing a. Double team ever Watch him in transition Then get back to me But that has nothing to do with how dame is guarded? Ill answer It doesnt! Classic draymond willing them back in this game CJ better tho Advanced metrics beg to differ Ill play your recency bias bullshit game! Draymond can create points out of nothing in a way nobody in Portland front court can nobody in basketball actually Who isnt a 1st option* I agree with all that but he does not draw a double team in the half court set Hes sagged off of from 3 But so what? I will even concede that Basketball is not solely a half court game even in the playoffs This isnt an argument about whos better Golden state has proven that Transition is what makes them tick and Draymond is the key to all of it This is an argument about whether dame and stephs current situation are comparable Transition shouldnt apply to that argument Its part of the fucking game dude Pick which discussion you wanna have How can you not count it I dont have to Yeh but it has nothing to do with the defense dame sees dude! Its the same discussion It does! Because nobody playing Portland has to worry about a Draymond getting loose in transition or pushing the ball
 At least not without nurkic Youre arguing that dame sees tons of attention that Steph doesnt because the warriors have more threats Transition basketball is different No Im saying Steph is seeing what Dame sees tonight Teams are consciously focusing solely against dame I hat situation They already do Then we lose Draymonds playmaking in transition is close to LeBron level If you wanna make an argument, its that Steph gets more open looks in transition bc draymond is good But that has nothing to do Danny Green! With the defensive gameplan Jesus Green is FUEGO Okay dame has never seen Box and 1 but everything else they are doing wit Steph dame has seen I just think they can swarm Steph In a way you cant with another great scorer on the court The warriors suck Blazers would sweep the raptors They can but I think what hurts them most is their other guys cant shoot. When its not All-Stars it turns into Aminu/Harkless real quick Every kawhi rebound I say boardman gets paid ? Danny Green slays Jews Cause they were Warriors! One of the greatest selfies in history ?Runner up nominee It's pretty crazy during those Cavs warriors finals battles 20% of the players on the court had shown the world their penises Boogie isnt going to get a big contract If he gets more than Nurk thatll be crazy ?I'm hearing this was the fan interaction Lowry reacted to I dont see it either Dehaan Lowry aka ?? I couldnt follow the whole convo so Im not sure if this is what you guys are debating but if Portland has draymond we win the title this season God I love this chat. I put my phone down for 2 hours and come back to 300 texts Game Love curry about to score 50 and they lose The Ibaka Hammer ?? ???? You just hate to see it Jesus fuck curry has more points than the rest of the team combined My summary 

Dylan loves Tucker Carlson 
Space and I have the same opinion of draymond 
Gundy is drinking the blazers kool aide but I respect it 
Houman is on acid Rengel yes! Mic drop Warriors fans gonna cry well we didnt have klay and kd.. well now you what what it feels like to be a fan of every other team Yeah the warriors are gonna have so many excuses this summer Rengel on fire! Durant coming back next year? "it's impossible to win with one super star , one all star and solid role players!" My favorite is a 73-win team was broken up to add Kevin Durant, not that Kevin Durant jointed a 73-win team. Get all the way the fuck out of here Dude with boogie they still have 3 all stars out there haha. And 1 of them is the only unanimous MVP in league history! Like cry me a fucking river Jesus Chad you think wed be worse if we traded CJ for draymond straight up? I need the Oliver maroney I always believed in kyle Lowry tweet Im loving this fucking game. Or to Ian the greatest of all time Remember when we laughed about the haters @klow7?!?l I think it depends who fills the 2 spot for us Dylan. But I completely agree with your assessment that the drop off from draymond to Aminu is much greater than CJ to Eric Gordon Well if Im olshey Ill take Quinn and Draymond for Meyers and CJ TODAY "Kyle Lowry has played phenomenal this series, but he's an even greater guy off the court. Couldn't happen to a better person" -Oliver https://twitter.com/bballbreakdown/status/1136472532310085632?s=21 Lol he's getting dunked on for this tweet "don't you cover basketball for a living" Bring back the 3-1 lead Warriors front office making 20,000 We Believe shirts as we speak Warriors could really use Harrison Barnes right now They could use Kevin Durant right now Wasn't that a goaltend? and CJ McCollum Lol second time! If they had CJ Steph would have 70 points! Anthony David would be a good summer addition for them So would larry David real talk does kawhi stay if they win? Zach Lowe said the raptors could be the strangest assembled champions ever. They got Kyle Lowry from Houston for a draft pick. Ibaka in a salary dump. Gasol at the trade deadline. Kawhi and green on a 1 year rental Hail Mary trade. Then all their role players with shrewd drafting in the late 20's I think he does I heard kawhi could sign a 1 or 2 year deal if they win Has there ever been an nba player named David? Yes Thatd be the smart move That makes sense I think he would stay And is smart Having fun playing ball is the ultimate expression to him imo Hes like basketball Messi Omg Jeff van gundy just said this team wouldnt make the playoffs with this squad tonight hes a fucking weirdo so who knows Jesus Christ he did not Yah if he coached them They wouldnt make the playoffs in the east* Unanimous mvp and 3 all stars. Spare me the pity God fuck the warriors They just can't catch a break I hope they never win another ring Finals should only be a 3 game series Something something Ming Dynasty You dont see Steve looking nervous very often This is the first game hes ever had to coach Guys Looney is out for the series they dont have a chance! Also is it just me or did it seem like Danny Green was an unnecessary throw in to the kawhi deal? Nobody was talking about it like he wasn't gonna be a plug and play 2 guard and I feel like San Antonio didn't need to include him Whats crazy is all these guys are out and any team would trade the left but and first born children to have this roster They could put patty mills in his spot for salary Id trade everyone for curry, draymond, boogie and 6 homeless guys nut* San Antonio did it knowing it would eventually break up the warriors That's some Jedi magic bunky Poppovich fed Kerr misinformation at that dinner This game aint over tho Warrior fans cheering like they are up 10 This cover is over! What was the line Fucking lmao Fred Van Fleek The Shockers!!!!! Iced Game CJ for Van Fleet who says no? The Raptors I feel awful for the warriors fan thought paid 120k for courtside seats for this Who wants to gamble I got warriors to win the series Theyre mostly Indian born venture capitalists Rengel dont worry Beyonce probably already left Who wants it Ill bet you $1100 Houman and I get free prostate cancer checks for life Yeah lol Im sitting across from Houman rn But someone please gimme that It was Vivek ranadive never mind ?So proud of my Mom Ian gave me something juicy The DAGGER from Gasol ?Wow. Check mate. His cock? Curry cant win on his own he sucks https://ftw.usatoday.com/2017/11/kevin-durant-chris-boucher-warriors-rookie-instagram-account-roasting-nba Chris Boucher revenge series Wow I remember LeBron playing by himself against the raptors Also, how did OG miss the entire playoffs with an appendicitis and Boogie came back from a torn quad? Whose OG Thanks for the money mark! STEAL A TACO It my favorite, you know me so well! Houman do you even follow the nba Wow OG anonuby OG Anounoby Steph fraudulent Ohh Ya what chad and I said Can we all take a moment Lebron hit the buzzer beater bank shot over him last year And realize the boogie didnt play the 2nd half Just found this out Not true I remember him shooting a bad layup no? He played 19 min They said "he has no lift" Boogie also major fraud My god What a chump I wasnt able to watch the 3rd due a blackout or whatever Remember when LeBron beat Toronto on his womb Yeah I think he played the third So I missed most of that Houman blacked out from too much acid Own? Lol The bar we were at didnt pay theyre cable bill Wow me neither Houman was rock climbing during second half Houman is lost in the sauce To err is to be Houman Rengel I only would if you came Shrooms are legal in Denver now. I'm flying right now Im coming to New York just for that And Oakland... Cokeland* Gundy I'm dying at that RT lmaoooo I miss that dylan https://twitter.com/rohannadkarni/status/1136478485353050112?s=21 Yeah the older I get the more I realize cocaine will always be the most timeless drug Coke will be in is 2085 Yeah Coke is transcendent Hippies, ravers, hipsters, Wall Street bros Yep All like blow Coke is like Ferris buehler https://youtu.be/mHa1zTLrXO8 https://twitter.com/omaroneynba/status/1136473560606683136?s=21 I was at the chiropractor tonight and he just casually starts telling me about the blow he did in New Orleans last weekend Woah watching that clip that movie is woke af Wow man I've only met the guy twice Get this The principal is Reagan I also give them credit Bueller is cocaine Birds of a feather! I gave Matt so much credit for sharing that tweet with us I never doubted him But I wouldnt have been surprised if he never did share it with us What the fuck was that question "You scored 109 when you won and then you scored 109 when you lost. Does that mean you need to play better defense?" You're a basketball writer?? https://twitter.com/cwilliamson44/status/1136479816977473536?s=21 ? Drake insta story 30 min ago What if the warriors sitting Klay out forces him to L.A. or Portland Bring him home LOL. Gundy I love your thoughts but Klay isnt leaving the warriors Klay sat out because they knew it was 1-1 and theres no need to risk him. He will be back next game 99.99% I just smoked a kief bowl I miss keif bowls Please take another for me We will see Kd might stay now too Especially if they lose Nah no way Idk Id loves this I think KD walls.... Klay, green stay Youre done without me KD got want he wanted and now he can walk Gsw knows they can win with the trio of green Klay curry and get other players Or at least be competitive enough to be there every year I hope he goes to NY Build him a burgerville in his house and he will come Klay loves seasonal shakes Think about this kyrie + AD in nets And this is realistic That would be sick Im coming home for some walla wallla onion RINGS They have so much money is ridiculous Its* What are they trading for AD? Brooklyn is also a good organization D-lo, picks in the future D-lo sign and trade Jarrett Allen, D-Lo and picks Seems highly unlikely but I like the idea At this point pelicans only really good offer is LA.... Everything else is just to keep away from La S&T are incredibly rare Jarrett Allen And dinwiddie Honestly Is better than the Lakers package Lol my burgerville story;

I guess my dad married some woman in college and then got divorced within a year. Anyway, my mom thought learning this would be like upsetting to my brother and me. So we went to burgerville and my parents sat us down and told us, and like neither my brother or I cared? I dunno what they were expecting lol. Oh god Gundy No no no Lakers package is by far the best package... Gundy stop If you include a figure pick and maybe Joe Harris? Like one is 10/10, the next is 5/10 *future Ok Chat Future will suck if they have two all starts Any of you watched I think you should leave yet? They wont get a lottery pick e we Ever* But for real who is gonna make a serious offer outside LA? I still think Ainge sits this one out Jarrett, Joe Harris, Dinwiddie and a pick Yeah lottery pick is a game changer Not as good as Lakers but it depends what you want Ummm one sec Gundy Lonzo, Ingram, kuzma ans #4 I thought you were gonna say Your dad prefers Dicks I dont think all 3 get offered They were offered before Truthfully I think its only 2 Idk but lets just say hypothetically they do Is that a better offer? Then Lakers LA surprisingly has more leverage now. They can reduce their mid season offer. They're bidding against themselves I would do Im just not sure thats the offer anymore Okay Nah the Lakers arent getting ad But is the Lakers offer that I said way better? They just cant man. Its better but I wouldnt say way because Dinwiddie and Harris are cost-controlled at team friendly deals Allen is on a rookie contract Ingram is gonna cost 20-25M Per year Starting next summer As much as I love dinwiddie Like if your 4th pick turns into him 4th PICK!!!! Its more of a disappointment Than anything Nets can offer anything close to that Not like a flat out bust There's gotta be a kawhi type deal out there. They need to find a B level all star rather than a collection of average players You guys big Darius garland fans? Or Jarrett Culver? I mean if the Nets give d-like D-lo Sign and trade? CJ and Collins is better than the Nets package D-lo + picks and random picks and players could work Like if youre the pelicans and you get a lot of good role guys from the Nets with Zion and Jrue is sick D-lo has to go if they get kryie Yeah chad I agree but Id contend d-lo has more trade value than cj Rn Idk gundy I'm kinda in the opposite camp. I'd take a 3rd high level player And a sign and trade is perfect since he is a restricted free agent Would you do Knicks or lakers package?

Knicks: Mitchell Robinson, 3rd pick, Kevin Knox

Lakers: Ingram, Kuzma, 4th pick Lakers Kuzma is better than the kicks player But this is like 40/60... very close What if we switch Kuzma for Lonzo to Chicago and pelicans get the 4, 6 and Ingram? Still Lakers) ? Cause thats an offer Ive seen So pelicans would get 4,6 and ? 4,6 and lonzo? Lonzo to the Bulls for 6 and then the Lakers put 6 + 4, Ingram to the pelicans I would do that The upside is greater plus it gives you the flexibility to build very young Yeah youd probably get Garland and Culver or Garland and Hunter At that point Ingram would get a contract that he doesnt deserve but whatever Along with Zion and Ingram Yea it could be interesting and fun to watch Pelicans could be sick if thats the deal Agreed I dont think they will trade for CJ cause he makes too much money So lakers keep kuzma, ad, lebron ? Yeah LeBron, Kuz, AD and then figure out the rest CJ isnt going anywhere... there isnt another player that teams would be willing to trade that would make our team better I like the knocks package there actually I would only trade CJ for AD Mitchell Robinson is like the ideal center next to Zion Outside that I'm hoping for Blake or maybe Love for scraps Knox has the highest upside, you get the pick and Robinson will always be valuable for his athleticism It could be like next level DeAndre and Blake Honestly Knicks would probably throw in frank for Dennis Smith to get that done too Frank OR Dennis Smith Yeah Gundy Im like affirmatively in favor of Knicks In that scenario Would you still do that over 4, 6 and Ingram as well? Nah Bet on yourself Take the picks Chemistry does matter You can choose it in the draft If you get 4 and 6 Take that More than any other time No Im with you Yeah the Lakers have been rumored for that move 4,6 and ingram is a slam dunk Either sending Lonzo to Chicago or Phoenix For 6 or 7 Thats the best deal you could ever ask for Package that with 4 and Ingram, thats the deal Lonzo fetches 6 or 7 straight up? Nahhh Allegedly Lol I mean its Phoenix But the luster is gone with lonzo I still think Phoenix could be a wild card. What about Ayton, Josh Jackson and 6 People like Zach Lowe like him still He can set contribute but no one has inflated expectations for him at this point I also still like him For what its worth And he will no longer where BBB shoes Thats a good sign for his injuries I hope He is an elite defender Lonzo's one year of lucky shooting in college is still mesmerizing. People were giving him Steph curry range And passer Take away his shooting and he loses a ton of luster I agree lonzo is decent but hes 3 years in now His floor is bigger Ricky Rubio Teams would rather take a chance Like, thats really good for a floor Fox is better Can you give me a single example of a team dishing a top 10 pick for a guy like lonzo? Ill concede Great point space Phoenix makes a lot of sense to pair him with Booker. A guy who can defend 3 positions and doesnt need the ball Same with Chicago and Zach LaVine Honestly you can argue this is fumble but you cant argue tho isnt true; you dont get a top 10 pick without giving up multiple first rounders or an all-star Don't forget the Monty Williams angle and Sarver being hungry for talent now And the Booker AD Kentucky connection Lonzos lack of need for the ball and ability to defend make him a fit basically anywhere you want and if youre a younger team, it makes a lot of sense to add him Lavar can only be in one place at one time Hes not a legitimate concern Don't you think Chicago could snag someone with similar potential as Lonzo at 7 tho? And have 2 extra years on their rookie deal Lavar is done, his only move is to sit back and market himself as a changed man who only error was loving his son too much Idk why they'd be clamoring to do that Lauri and Wendell are growing, they just paid LaVine Lol Let me tell you If chi traded their pick for lonzo Theres gonna be a second fire Yeah I agree. Chicago ain't doing that Lonzo sucks There I said it Lonzo has a place in the nba And honestly none of those top three Are exactly dominant Sure he does The only scenario lonzo fetches a pick But Im sick of hearing him as this trendy trade piece Is like a scenario when the sonics trades Ray for 4 Team that can contend rn but randomly has a pick Lol hot take Except lonzo ain't he helping a contending team lol Lakes are lucky if lonzo fetches a first rounder He's booty I like that take Lakers are lucky if he stays and is a career 7th man I mean no one wants role players Hes Jeremy linn maybe DJ augustin Theres a million quality vets wholl sign a one year contract Hes a fine player cool. Like hell have a long career George hill in the playoffs was great Exactly I mean the only argument for lonzo Is that hes like dipo Is his crazy family is interesting? And for what its worth All I wanna say is LeBron woulda won tonight and Steph couldnt Everyone ripped the pacers And those pacers teams have been better than the thunder when dipo is healthy Dipo at every point of his career was better than lonzo Even when he wasnt really good yet Dude what about the lebron vs Kawhi saga makes you say that? Cmon I love lebron but Kawhi has his number Lol I just dunno why just bc the warriors became great we all decided defensive basketball was irrelevant The next dynasty isnt just gonna be warriors.2 Ian you dont understand this team is so depleted! Lo They have no one left Lol* No I agree but the raptors controlled the game start to finish Lebron wouldnt have won tonight No Im kidding sorry Fuck the warriors I honestly think the raptors are just solid and really deep and really healthy Dylan are you messaging from different devices Or does it keep just randomly switching lol youll never know will you Now Im exited Full boner Lebron didnt make the playoffs lol Excited This is getting ridiculous lol I have to say I love arguing on this chat If you guys are watching the raptors rn and the only conclusion you can draw from it is that they played in the east And are lucky Whats the poin? Point The bucks were good Like totally dominant Lol the wild wild country episode on documentary now is classic af Batshit country lol And they just ran through the bucks The raptors If you see that and go Oh the bucks must have sucked It was of saying holy shit maybe Kawhi is the mvp Instead of saying* Also god damn Theres some world class arguers in here Houman Did punching the warriors in the cock game 1 count for nothing? Starting with space I mean even game two they got everything they wanted and just went cold I think lebron would do pretty well on a team with the raptors talent lol Lol well yeah duh Is that what were saying? Well Houman said lebron wouldnt have won tonight Wait a minute Lol Either you or i are misreading this Can we all take a moment to realize how great BpP was I think people are saying lebron could have beat the raptors Especially once turner moved out and Mitch moved in BPP season 2 Which I think is nuts I mean not nuts but I dont think that Ah my bad Dehaan think the opposite of what youre saying Lebron would have done the same as curry tonight had he had the same squad... been kinda close all game Thought Houman was having more crazy thoughts Lol think the opposite of what what youre saying Is one of the greater accidental burns Ive ever heard Tonights warriors squad was like the cavs squads Agreed Def Oh yeah mean like a normal finals team? and not some bullshit super team like they normally are? No no this isnt a normal finals team lol Lol A normal finals team is with Klay I dunno I think its raps bucks now And that fucking rules Can we all go back to loving Gsw when they didnt have KD They have boogie, Iggy, draymond, and stephe How is that not enough? Ohh you mean boogie right Dude warriors still winning the title Great Lakes bitches! Like think about this for a second Denver next year going to be ???? Hey Dehaan Who didnt play all playoffs or this game second half Boogie isnt a threat clearly Wanna put 50 on that like Houman did? I did I dunno about Denver I think theyre sort of like the blazers Theyre really good and always a threat to go far But right now I dont see them as serious contenders Would love to be proved wrong bc theyre a lot of fun So lets say Klay and KD are our all year Youre saying rockets arent a finals team or this team isnt a finals team? Im till confused by this Houman? Im confused by that Houman said this isnt a finals team Why does my Denver take have to do with the rockets? So how far does this warriors lineup tonight go in the playoffs Denver isnt going anywhere... Gsw will get to the finals again next year They may not win but they will get there Weirdly In the west Boogie, steph, draymond Prob the finals Yeah exactly Boogie isnt the same In the east? Depends on their seed So thats my point this is what a normal finals should look like no more boring super team The raptors are more like a spurs team Just deep and healthy and fucking good. Theyre not stacked Thats not a bad thing lol No not at all Its cool actually I just think they found something Kawhi, siakam and Ibaka lowry I cant remember the last time I saw perimeter d like that No I ?? Lowry But the way Kawhi and siakam can just fly toward shooters Warriors have never seen that But honestly Warriors with curry Klay green will
Make the finals next year. Rockets I believe (could be wrong) are going to implode and do something absurd. Denver is like Ian said... just kinda there but not a contender. Okc is going to commit suicide with Westbrook for another year Giannis is fucking BROODING rn What Im saying is though if KD and Klay died in a plane crash this is a cool balanced league in a weird way Theres so much less chalk No if klay and Durant dont come back the warriors lose 4-1 Yes Agreed but one of them will agree And if they were never there they lose 4-0 They also prolly would lose to the rockets To the bucks too... so no one else in the west beats this raptors team? Yeah its debateable Thats what Im finding hard to believe Absolutely! Dude what do they have to do? nothing The have a bette record than anyone in the west Cause they will get max deal Better point differential But you think Denver goes in there and raptors win 4-1? And finals mvp Kawhi Im just curious 4-2 Id Denvers lucky The bottom half of the east is trash But Toronto and Milwaukee are monsters Toronto bullied golden state in game one And imposed their will in game 2 I just think its more nuanced than that and matchups are coming into play Sixers barely lost to the raptors The dont give away half the third quarter this series is 3-0 And the sixers are raw dude! youre saying if KD and Klay were dead sixers, raptors and bucks are the top 3 teams in the league? The sixers underperformed if anything all year Yeah Ehhh its a different series, hard to say. Because now its a big man game Jokic changes it all As Ive said Can gasol really guard jokic? Cause Leonard can clearly guard Klay or curry Its just weird cause blazers had a winning record against those teams Over and over and over again Yeah I know I just dont agree I agree theyre good ass teams Yeah but if you remove the sixers thats not true Superliga poll: is Ian more of a bucks fan or heat fan now? Why are the sixers not tied with the raptors Ian? And transitive property is always a mess They literally lost on a buzzer beater I mean you could go on forever Spurs went 7 with the nuggets How good are the spurs? west > east Yeah I honestly just think you remove KD and klay out of equation all other rosters stay the same and 6 teams have a shot at the finals Thats my point Ian Cant compare regular season records You can never compare reg season Whats your point lol Rockets, warriors (depleted), blazers, nuggets, sixers, bucks, raptors You think the blazers are better than the raptors and bucks? You think no team has a shot I think all those teams have a shot and matched up one another would be interesting af You said raptors have better regular season record than anyone in west No man Im asking Do you think that? How bout this Ian Omg we arent having the blazers and top 3 in east conversation again or Im going to have to ask chad to drop some blazers knowledge on you I think the blazers are better than the sixers And the sixers could be in the finals Thats fine Thats what Im saying The blazers absolutely have an argument Is its not like the raptors won 15 straight playoff games That theyre better than philly Agreed Id take philly gun to my head but whatever Im agreeing the raptors are awesome but its not a black and white discussion when you remove the warriors out of equation Bucks, raps, warriors in the league of their own 
Then Denver, sizers, blazers, rockets But bucks and raps are a league above the blazers It actually would make the league even more interesting Wow Yes the raptors who almost lost the sixers Houman said it best A LEAGUE ABOVE! I cant believe this Should we do a premier league for the nba? This is retarded I so wish kawhi missed that shot Relegations? So this argument would be fucking dead How would this change the argument? It would lol Are you arguing that blazers re better than raptors? Sizers vs bucks and who knows who would have moved on youd have your mouth off of the raptors dick for 1 No no Hes saying the raps shouldnt be there And who knows bucks might be losing against this warriors team Ok so you are saying blazers are better than raptors? Stop bringing up the blazers! Fuck !?!?!!?!!? Im saying its legit nuanced like I think there are different outcomes for each matchups I see Portland losing to raptors but Denver beating raptors The raptors were 1 shot away from losing in 2nd round Oh god I see Portland beating sixers Would you be saying they were a league above if Leonard misses that shot? Yeah but sixers beating rockets Raptors beat blazers 4-1 I mean youre literally riding this argument Ian on a fucking miracle amazing shot Ian I agree with dylan and Dehaan here Had that not happened its a diff story but then again we can do what ifs Giannis is good but they were young and inexperienced like the nuggets Yeah exactly Cause then we can do a lot of what ifs Raptors smoked bucks cuz they are good and full of vets with playoff experience Because theyre better at 4 positions and by every statistical measure at our disposable, are in the finals, beat the same warriors team game 1 that swept you, and are up 2-1. Good night. Nuggets maybe beat bucks and rockets in 7 blazers lose to those guys in 6 but beat sixers in 5 but nuggets lost to sixers in 7 4 positions? Like youre throwing matchups entirely out the window thats what I dont like. Raptors are fully healthy thats HUGE Thats an advantage blazers didnt have like nurkic changes this entire equation just like KD and klay do If its blazers bucks idk what happens or blazers or sixers we have advantage and if its blazers raptors we prolly lose in 5. But wed never play the raptors cause kawhi misses that shot and klay gets hurt in April in my fantasy world! And nurkic fucks embid Nurkic kanter and embid in a series would be fun on the court and on social media Change the name to east coast bias Superliga Im going to bed Space is def more of a bucks fan than heat fan now Ok sorry The heat are the best team in the nba If Rodney mcgruder stayed healthy Yall would be toast ?What did I miss Holy thats gotta be a record. Jimmy might have wilt like numbers tho Ive been on vacation for nearly a week and we still arguing east v west? Youd think Tupac and biggie were still alive My Lyft driver is playing biggie right now so I think I have to take his side Bad Boy 4 Lyfe https://twitter.com/jordanpeele/status/1136480702210273281?s=12 Omg The guy courtside who shoved Kyle Lowry is a part owner of the warriors Bahaha bitch Hes gonna get Donald sterlingd real quick Hes gonna get the Texas tech Marcus smart guy treatment ? https://twitter.com/karengeier/status/1136019191356674049?s=12 ?#FaZeUp Fuck Vanterpool is leaving us Brutal For Minnesota? Coward Next year was out year too Our* Now Neil can say we haven't had the coaching continuity necessary to achieve sustained success Only cowards leave Oregon for Minnesota Good thing we dont know anybody personally that has done it Terrible organization haha but he may have a chance to snag the head role in a few years if he plays his cards right I think the first Latino president of basketball ops in nba history has them in a good spot ^bias Jp but why? Vanterpool is a great hire Hes picking the staff for Ryan Saunders and making sure its elite O for sure. Im surprised they got him to leave Houston is a mess right now Their new owner is cheap Wiggins and Towns are bros with Saunders too so that helps I will not stand for this slander guys. Please apologize KD out game 4 I dont think hes playing this series Cant wait for a game 7 comeback Lol I think Toronto is winning in 5 now Gundys back on the kief If the Warriors keep defending the way they did yesterday idk if they can win Marijuana is legal now Houman get over it Fair but game changes if Klay comes back All of a sudden it goes back to the 20-0 run the warriors had in game 2 We all know ur comments r just because ur in big pharmas pocket I want to see what Klay looks like but even 50% Klay helps Damn the guy that shoved lowry was only able to buy in because Vivek had to divest when he bought Kings Nice one Vivek Kinda funny being an owner if someone else controls 51% https://www.instagram.com/p/ByYYQ_qA-Hq/?igshid=1duo29mnaysa0 Fuck Great work Neil! Couldn't just double his salary? Smh Fuuuuck Brutal https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1136731760887308288?s=21 Da fuck Yah what Just cause you have a lot of picks doesnt mean you just spray em lol I'm really confused on what to think of this What the fuck Prince was a waiver guy in our fantasy league I guess Atlanta wins this but Prince is pretty dope. I feel like you hope you get a player his caliber at 17. So they just did this for the extra pick next year? Yeah I feel like this is the first move in a greater play How does the money match up? Atlanta ate a shit ton of money Prince only makes like 3 mil. But it's only one season Brooklyn is just swinging for the FA fences this summer Yah they have two slots now So they have 2 max players + another like right below max player Idk I guess if I'm Brooklyn it's not as bad as I first thought. They weren't gonna get a player as good as prince right now at 17. So basically they just traded Crabbe and a first next year to dump his salary Theyre gonna try for KD and Kyrie They have roughly $23mil on the next roster That'd be like us trading ET and a first right now to dump him which wouldn't be shocking. And we wouldn't even be able to sign a significant player with that room like the nets can Damn Kyrie and KD in Brooklyn would be kinda sick I would never go to a game... ticket prices would be absurd Fuckkk Get season tix now How much are they gonna have to pay DAngelo? Hes a RFA, right? Like whats the market for him He will probably get a max otter but I bet he ends up in Phoenix Brooklyn, Phoenix, Utah, Pacers apparently I want Toronto tomorrow Justin heads up The d-lo to pelicans is looking more juicy now... and kyrie + ad to nets How do yall rank importance of head cocach vs assistant staff They couldn't do Kyrie and KD, and trade D lo To sign both those guys they'd have to renounce d lo's rights Fuck KD. Get ad and kyrie Thats for sure possible Yeah they could do that Id rather have KD AD and a burner pg Ish Smith Except IIRC you can't add players to a sign and trade So it would have to be D Lo and picks for AD. Nets couldn't add anyone else Id take KD over Davis + kyrie personally ? They banned the Warriors owner for a year and fined him 500k Damn lol Half a mil I thought they would force him to sell Nahhh He fucked up But I even think the word shove is a bit of an exaggeration Lowry said like 20 minute ago he wanted him out of the league lol He said that this morning lol But hes obviously emotionally charged by the whole thing Thats a little excessive Yeah They just had media availability bro A fine and a series ban I was watching I mean dude Blue lives matter. Lowry should shut up and play! He might have said it again But he def said it Earlier Hes just another lazy millionaire! *fox news playing in the background* ? Does it matter whether he said it both times? No lol Not in any capacity whatsoever Lol okay I was just watching the nba tv coverage of the press conferences from today I think the difference was today Lowry knew that guy was a part owner Damn banned for a year now I literally just said that to start this conversation lmao Oh lol Honestly thats huge cause they open their new arena next year Yeah And he lost half a mil That probably hurts more than the fine or having to sell his shares I think this is fairly appropriate punishment lol If anything excessive But fuck that guy What a turd 500k is loose change to this guy hes worth 2.3 billion He bought 7% of the dubs from Vivek Thats the high end of what Ive heard anyway https://twitter.com/cwilliamson44/status/1136479816977473536?s=12 Zdeno Chara broke his jaw in game 4 on Tuesday after taking a puck to the face, he's playing tonight And meanwhile Kyle Lowry wants a pat on the back! REAL MEN PLAY HOCKEY! ? ? Space is on a heater Lololol ? Hockey memes baby https://www.instagram.com/p/ByY2lKkgNs_/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link Are we trading for Kevin Love!? This reminds me of a heated debate I had with jake Logan when he said hockey players are better athletes than nba players Gundy what's a Love trade look like in your book?? ?Home of your 2020 NBA Champions Meyers, Turner, 25 and a future 2nd for Love Cleveland desperately lacks long term draft capital They traded it all during the LeBron Return Or Meyers and Harkless maybe Meyers trade value is at an all time high Gotta cash out when we're hot We would have to start Zach then but we wouldnt have to rely on him a ton offensively which would be nice I wonder if any of these owner fines actually get paid Dude if thats the trade thats great for us Loves injury history is sketchy but for Leonard/ harkless turner and a few picks lets go https://twitter.com/zackfox/status/1136720792153206784?s=21 Did jake Logan vote for trump? Lol sure did Jake Logan and Dylan Branch are now friends on Facebook ?Hopefully that leg holds up! Also wentz getting paid off of what, 12 good games? Over 3 years Id rather pay wentz than dak Seriously Yup agreed But went now got most guarantees ever, just passed Russels deal Hot prediction: I think gardner minshew will replace foles by week 12 so if dak is getting paid then wentz should be too The Jags only need Foles for weeks 17-20 Thats when he becomes the GOAT Jags aint making it to playoffs Marcus winning the division Wow gone in 60 seconds is on again what a #blessed week I just stole fifty cars in one night.

Interesting I love heaven All these songs have such unique beats... its awesome Oh wow nice Its raining in Portland so I have no choice but to listen to future all day His new LP dropped today Holy hail Ian lets do another $15 tonight. Ill take Warriors with spread -4? Only asterisk is I need Klay to play Ok so wait and place your bet lol And its 4.5 God mark your already in the whole its time to turn this ship around! Throw some payola and the night warriors! France just had the sickest goal taken away by VAR I mean she was offsides Wow thats sexist Brock. Why do you hate womens sports? I mean sure but barely And it was gonna be a blowout anyway lol The goal that was scored 3 minutes later was lame by comparison Wow Gundy are you saying rules dont matter if its a blowout? Wow Do you not think female athletes should be held to the same standards as men? Thats sexist Im in this for me Not for equality Also I very much want to bet on France to win it all I put down some coin the the USWNT +300 because its a ?? Damn thats great odds Ian I want $15 on warriors with line https://twitter.com/thehill/status/1137154288055201793?s=21 Wtf lol Lol did they send out the link? Man is Klay the key? Klay is more important to GAW than CJ is to Portland Im drunk But I regret nothing Trade CJ for AD 2020!!!!!! Guys we can get GSW next year But who are we going to need to get in the second round? We can beat anybody honestly Jesus We just need to keep the core And trade the expirings in The core is Dame and CJ Anybody else Can go Wait CJ is only on the table for AD I wouldnt do Jimmy Ive never seen Jimmy get 40 on the road in a must win situation And I know he cant do it I'm in gundy. CJ for AD 2020 All out for AD baby Dame, AD and Nurk New Twin towers I would do Jimmy if we add him to dame and CJ Yea but no way we trade one of them for him I vote we wait and save the assets to the end But if we can get love for whatever I want to do that I would rank my semi realistic wish list 

1. Blake
2. Jimmy 
3. Love Warriors cant hit a shot love this!!! Cant wait to hear how its all about the matchups! Is kings landing getting burned by dragons? Basketball players continue to play with tooth on court. Your move hockey meme guy Ok so Lets talk east vs west? How bad do the raptors have to obliterate the warriors Til I can Uber eats curried crow to all your houses Its setting up for kd to win finals down 3-1 Sure dude Crickets eh boys? Why are you trying to convert us to warriors fans? Thats on you bro ?????? ???????????? Masai is the black panther West coast best coast Chad youre in the middle of the country lol Yeah lol this is like when players laugh after an airball https://twitter.com/erik_gundersen/status/1137167577271025664?s=21 Are Dylan and Dehaan awake? I agree with Dylan Ah yes the blazers would smoke these nerds Never said that but I feel pretty confident we would smoke these warriors also. This is the exact same lineup that swept you lol Warriors fan head to the exits I wonder if they are going to be raptor fans by game 4?! 65% Klay, fractured collar bone Looney. I beg to differ Ian Lol get out of here Kawhi started this series hurt and they dominated them game one Did I say anything about Kawhi? Did I say anything negative about Toronto? ? No but its not a great excuse for the warriors They still got worked in game 1 Yeah I mean losing with 3x all stars playing is never a good look And come on its not a huge leap of logic that making excuses for the warriors is minimizing Torontos accomplishment But as far as the gameplay is concerned at this point the Blazers could have hung Toronto faced a broken team We wore them out Blazers would for sure be up 3 to 1 too You need to calm down on the easts dick for a sec Oh do I!? Toronto is great I feel pretty good about it! So is Milwaukee And philly is really good Top heavy conference Definitely But does it matter? Jazz, old, clippers and spurs werent contenders WOW FUCK SPORTSMANSHIP SHOOT THE FUCKING BALL I mean good thing for the reports that lebron moved out west Raptors Or that Kawhi moved out east lol Its not like lebron has ever had a problem with Kawhi or anything Coach pop controls the league The warriors path to the finals would have been a lot tougher if their 5 all star starters were non existent earlier on. Its easy to look at a series as wins and losses but its a different story when injuries are involved. Top heavy east Need I remind you Blazers also lost Nurk early on. But raptors are fucking legit Real earlyyyyyy So are bucks Masai is a god damn oracle Yeah has there ever been a mid season trade as crucial and worked out so well as Gasol No GM in the league had the balls to fire the fucking coach of the year then trade for a 1 year rental But Masai did Blazers lost to the same team... Klay wasnt 65%... guy dropped like 30pts Dude klay missed one game Durant missed the whole series Olshey got small balls Does the raptors being 100 percent healthy factor into anything at all? Blazers in no way would have beat this team! and if they were so good how come you didnt pick them Blazers were exhausted. Dame had no gas left Because the bucks are also really good? God I hate basketball. When does football season start When is the World Cup? When is Ramadan again? Kawhi is going to mind fuck us all Hes gonna go to the clippers Ask lulu? Honestly have no idea lol And Durant to the Knicks We are now in the player happiness era Titles no longer matter RIP to the ringzzz era It's all about branding and happiness Kawhi and KD and Kyrie are going wherever they want Sorry to break it to you As if KD will be more happy in NY But it works for us because Portland is one of the best places in the NBA to settle Lol Portland probably is 2nd for KD behind New York He seems like someone that would make a good life in LO We can get Love Or any overpaid star For expirings that come up this year Does a mark Jackson coached warriors beat this raptors squad?? Ok so I cant use

Playoff performance
Overall record 
Point differential 
Common opponents 
Etc etc etc

What metric am I allowed to use to evaluate the raptors? Sexiness The Raptors are frauds. They are not the north. Portland is. Toronto is south of Portland! Toronto > Portland Well obviously YOU think that Wow one guy wears a turban courtside at a raptors game and all of the sudden hoomie is a huge fan #diversity #towelWaver Lol Danny green went 1/8 and was +11 I think we need to retire +\- Every star nerd prefaces +/- by saying I know I know it doesnt mean anything but then they still bring it up lol ?Yikes They got kawhi looking like the aliens in district 9 Fookin prawns What the hell is a testicular contusion and why does it sound like the most painful thing that couldve ever happened to Mitch Haniger Testicular torsion ESPN said contusion Did he just get hit in the balls super hard? Yea Looks like the ball hit his balla torsion is much much much worse my bad Fuuuuck thats brutal They said they think he ruptured one of his testicles Jesus Lololol Im sorry I just looked at the box score Klay had his best game of the playoffs last night He scored more than in any game he played against the playoffs The blazers* It was his second best scoring night (he had 32 on night against the clippers) And shot 11-18 Just wanna confirm, the take is that the raptors are doing this bc klay isnt healthy right? Also my raps in 5 call from Thursday looking pretty good ?These are pretty sick Dubov STRIPES ARE IN BABY! Lol I forgot my grinder had a keef catch Opened it for the first time in forever ? Time to get high! Please dont od Marijuana is a gateway drug Snort that If youve never done it before be aware that keef gets you way higher - so high youll start thinking the east is better then the west Space remember when I told you if you did Molly you might start doing heroin Such a naive chap I was. Both are great https://twitter.com/vanexel31/status/1137749270298316800?s=21 KD cleared for practice today Place your bets! Warriors +2.5 now Could go down if Kd plays! So bet now! Kd aint playing, his Achilles ruptured KD will rupture his Achilles lol Hasnt yet ? ?Uglier shot than his brother Lol Look like jokim Noah shot ? Does he shoot 2 handed? https://twitter.com/hgomez27/status/1137900239678058496?s=21 Thats almost exactly what the text I sent space about Obama said Pelicans are asking for an all star, player with all star potential, and two first round picks for AD CJ, Zach and two firsts?? Lol no one outside this group thinks Zach has all star potential but I think thats a fair trade Do the blazers have two firsts? What about Simons? Not this year but we could trade this years and 2021 And Zach Lowe has written about Zach being the potential star we could have I think all-star potential prob means more along the lines Thats already in the fold Could develop into a good player/hasnt peaked yet Not like is a fringe all star rn I guess if hes a center lol Wasnt Steven Adams an all star? I think he was borderline but he never made it Who were the centers in the west? Cousins Like back then? No last year Oh wait they did away With east/west Forgot Well kind of They still have the front court/backcourt Which makes it harder for centers I dont know who this person is https://twitter.com/ballthen/status/1137914114984955906?s=21 But this thread is interesting I like all of it except the trade dame part Keep him even if we suck What if it was dame for Davis straight up? Honestly nah And thats just me being sentimental Does anyone want warriors tonight? KD back Alright guys! Time to go all in on gs! Just overheard a guy on the phone at lunch "I gotta get the fuck out of California" I heard a guy on the phone today we need to get these Californians the fuck out of Oregon Spoiler alert: it was me on the phone why the fuck is KD playing tonight Hes been getting dragged by the Warriors media lately He wants to be the hero I bet that plays some part Yah he can only gain by playing No risk Or he could make his injury significantly worse Outside of him getting more hurt but ya little risk overall- if they comeback and win his time there will be validated If he plays then the reinjury risk is low Not like he has a contract at stake anyway The entire reason he traveled with the team is so that he can continue to get treatment in the locker room during games because he needs it that frequently Sounds to me like he shouldnt be playing I just got a random voicemail from a dude with the most bad ass South Carolina accent. Its like southern MAGA mixed with alligator salesman mixed with still smokes pipe tobacco with a dash of David duke We have no way of knowing He has 30 teams ready to max him with a torn acl I mean thats what his brand manager told me. She said she would be surprised if he played this series and here we are. KD sucks this shouldnt be a story His fragile ego is going to cause him long term pain Great for content tho He comes back and wins the series all of a sudden his earned ships goes to 3 He playing for three titles I heard from someone at Wieden they shelved a KD ad because of the injury Yeah thats true They were planning KD and Giannis win ads Plus a chance to banish the 3-1 lead demons Guy is being racist in Starbucks This was never an issue with Kobe. He was a true competitor. The GOAT. Mamba Mentality I think this is over even if kd scores 30 Which is honestly my ideal scenario No way game 7! I dont think he needs to score a ton, he adds an extra guy they have to worry about now that has the capability of scoring every time tho. They get this one tonight the series should go 7 Can I get raptors anybody ? The warriors getting their shit kicked tonight is the best chance for a warriors break up ?? KD gone no matter what Klay tho You think anyone else leaving gundy? Hmm but thatd be lakers Be careful what you wish for lmao Kd going to lakers regardless He did follow all their young players and LeBrons wife over the weekend ?????? Klay would be a good clipper too lmao Remember Jerry west insisted the warriors keep Klay instead of trade him for Kevin love I actually really want to see Klay on the Clippers Also, Klay loves burgerville Ya I only that happened Klay to minny butterfly effect If u keep same roster and add Klay r the rockets in the driver's seat ? Klay and Harden would be filthy https://twitter.com/hoopsanalysis/status/1136749136345214976?s=21 Vince Carter in the building for the raptors ?Just a couple of legends https://twitter.com/timbontemps/status/1138224740261400576?s=21 Last chance to bet warriors boys I gave mark pick em (which is a full goddamn point and a half) And since it IS the last night of the nba season Ill extend my generosity to you guys as well! I came out of bovada retirement to bet raptors tonight Durant esque Damn Houmans gonna owe me 50 too! Kevin! ? Marc Gasol saving the center position KD with the defense tho Sheesh Whoa Gretzky in the house Yup Achilles? Or calf again Fuuuuck Its gotta be Achilles Fuck man Im really hoping its not Dont worry Doris will get to the bottom of this Bye bye Achilles Told you Houman!

NOT GREAT Guys, we didnt put a **lower leg injury** warning for Dubov Somewhere, Clayton is ??ing his ?? to this video Nah thats not that bad Now if his little chicken leg snapped in half and you made Kevin ware jokes about it then I would drive up to Sowa and rip your tomato plants out of the ground Yeah thats jerk off material for sure next time KD has a twitter beef with a 12 yr old https://twitter.com/cassidyhubbarth/status/1138278446264700928?s=21 What is Dr houmans diagnoses ? Can you imagine if Mac Dre was the sideline rapper for the warriors Just rolling his face off with two women of each race next to him Keek da sneak Thats more likely an Achilles than not This fourth Is about to solidify Kawhi For all of eternity You mean ibaka?!? Also if I have to hear how the warriors are off tonight Im gonna spontaneously combust Theyre shooting 47% from three Kyle Lowry legacy game I mean they are a little off.... Youre a little off Lol How many players on this raptors roster are future hall of famers Just van fleet probably Steph and Klay are ballin 9-20 from 3 * Chernobyl scientist diagnosing KD* "he hurt his leg, not great not terrifying , I've seen worse he'll be better in a week" Holey Moley will be Steph Currys legacy BOARD MAN Also now could be a win it for KD narrative Gets paid Lol no travel??? NBA ready for the warriors to be done Norm Powell or Jordan idk?!? That wasnt a travel It was 2 steps and then his pivot foot slide 20 feet? In slo mo it looked like it but not in real time I agree with the doctor Kawai take over time Honorable name attempt Kawhis balls are seemingly as big as his hands. That was a travel tho Nah not a travel Not a travel NBA scale thats 10% a travel Man they shouldve gone for the kill 100% travel Find a new slant Holey Moley ? Kawhi a bunga baby ! Dont see it Dehaan Ya idk after seeing the replay they just showed at least Looks like 3 steps to me but irrelevant now Looks like they should count it Gotta count it Refs have been pro raptors Holy shit Steve Javie is drunk as hell Wowwwww Ball dont lie That counts in the SigEp backyard That was fast Damn that Toronto time out killed their momentum This is epic Wowwwwww Terrible shot Lame ?Venmo Jinx! 60% of the time it works every time!!!! LOL Lol mark I hate you so much rn I did the same thing Mark The east is better tho Right ? The east sucks KD barely even played Hahaha
 I gave mark the goddamn pick em Lowry?!! I know Lowry did not step up in his legacy game Lowry wouldnt even play 7 min a game on the blazers Now thats a VINTAGE raptors loss That's crazy that Lowry shot could've won a championship at the buzzer tho Fine line between hero and goat ONE MORE DAY OF BASKETBALL Im so pissed lol God I could have got you to take the goddamn line Jesus Christ Yeah and he shot it behind the backboard lolol Sometimes the limes are sour Nah this is what you get for being an upstanding guy Nice guys finish last ?Me trying to decide how this result affects spaces argument Lol sorry I mean it doesnt rn? That's why I'm thinking It could , it might not Patience! Mark def doesnt deserve any line movement Bovada says such and such Honestly though are argument it really whether we should count good but non contending teams toward strength of conference Yeah I know Be a man mark Gimme 1.5 points game 6 also he fights dirty and pays early Thats the real crime! Gambling is an unregulated industries.

RIP Guys if the warriors pull off the comeback, can we all agree that the West is the best conference of all time? Never rooting for the warriors sorry I'd rather listen to space gloat than steph No Durant is huge He was still efficient AF Blazers are gunna win the finals this year Tonight My boss was visiting from SF today and he's a classic casual sports fan aka huge warriors fan. He had the gall to say that Toronto fans were too cocky and should show some humility Bro tho I gotta say The east sucks? Ive had the displeasure of being around a fair amount of raps fans lately And theyre annoying as hell lol It reminds me of when the Seahawks won Like I love the Seahawks Dude don't do this space. Warriors fans are the worst in sports Raps fan are just as annoying But we were totally insufferable You guys are on the west coast... theres a shit Ton in nyc I know but theres no more annoying fan base than the one with a chip on their shoulder Inferiority complex etc I hate the warriors/fans almost as much as I love the blazers It's a personal vendetta Hahaha I mean Me too But yeah you lived there All sports fans are cunts True I dunno cubs fans might be the worst Yeah 4 years of that just drove me off the edge haha Is the best part about being a fan, you can be insufferable Who's the most likable fan base? Spurs? Taking the el past wriggleyville Case in point, were all duck fans and absolutely terrible people And then the train just loading up with red drunk cubs fans Enough to break a man I mean Yankees fans will like throw a bottle at you You put 14 light beers in me and a LaMichael James jersey on, Im going to spit on the opposing teams band. The most likeable fan base is the one you dont interact with By at least you dont have to hear about the cubs way https://twitter.com/scottstrazzante/status/1138293172080193536?s=21 Put .2 back on the clock!

And then leaning and telling my dad that she wants the d then put his arm around him and told my dad he loved him I wanted to slit his throat lol Wait lol did my previous text not go through? Did I delete it accidentally? No its just wild lmao Also Durants Achilles Still insane Why the fuck is he crying ? KD is alive... and hes going to be alive tomorrow and the next. Yeah I mean I feel for him But i dont feel for the warriors KD should be crying not Myers Unless Myers is the one that told KD you have tonplay tonight ?? Omg no one told KD he had to play tonight There was obviously pressure Bob Myers isnt dumb enough to tell KD he has to play lmao But he wanted to play Grown ass man Nba players can do whatever they want, especially one that is about to leave the franchise I definitely feel for KD Who is legitimately annoying but always always plays his ass off But come on he didnt get forced to play There was some media pressure Questioning whether if anybody else had sat out so long if they would be back by now? https://theathletic.com/1017348/2019/06/08/kawakami-exactly-when-the-warriors-need-kevin-durant-the-most-nobody-seems-to-know-exactly-whats-happening/ I think it was more media than the warriors Is he about to take that 30 million option and sit on the warriors all next year?

Who says no! ? What do the hornets get out of this? Dammit Im all thumbs today Yeah I dont get that part either They get off batum 2 years early Are Evan and moe expirings? Im confused as well Evan and Moe expire 2020 So they get out of Batum a year early Batum has a player option in 20-2021 worth 27 million hes definitely picking up So trading Batum lets them pursue a free agent in 2020 Blazers twitter saying its a bad trade for Portland lmao classic Portland Also Woj hasnt mentioned Portland once, which makes me think Neil is working Like actually working or working like Magic used to work I hope the former Gundy don't hit me with that reverse logic Neil just says that's a sign he's working a deal lol It's gonna come out after he's traded to NY that Portland was in consideration but they wouldn't part with one key asset Lolol yeah how is hearing no speculation a good sign And it's just gonna be another moral victory talking point on Olsheys belt Because Portland deals just happen We were in the running but we couldnt compete with a large market. Please ignore the fact that I wasnt willing to give up players that I drafted because I love them like my own children. Whens the last time Portland made a deal that was speculated about? Or even had a rumor All the speculative ones never happen At least for Portland Maybe Woj just doesnt take any Portland rumors seriously Its an exchange man. Neil gives Woj dirt on other teams so that Woj keeps his players names out of rumors until the last minute Its why Neil doesnt deal with anybody else And boxes us in the local media out COLLUSION! Im dying to know what Jodys plans are All zers assets are locked up Perfect for a sale Man if the Pels did that trade they could end up with Zion, Rui, and like Romeo Langford or Kevin Porter in the draft Jrue, CJ, Rui, Zion, Zach is a nasty lineup Julius Randle off the bench Sheesh Im watching that team on #NBAstreams every night Damn Whats our starting five in that trade? Dame, Hood, Batum, Aminu, AD? ?? LENGTH but no girth When Nurkic gets healthy tho >>>> AD & Nurk omg Nurk never coming back But it doesnt matter because were close to offloading Meyers Leonard Wow and then Skal can learn from AD Wow Wow wow wow Man when Dame has to miss a few games like he does every year and we have Anfernee-Anthony pick and rolls??!????? Bruins to the under tonight For all you game 7 degens Should be a good game ? Keep kuzma I like it Houman has the tiniest boner for Kyle kuzma He fits best with LeBron out of the youngsters on offense He just floats and cuts, doesnt need plays run for him But if thats what keeps them from getting AD??? Hes a poor mans Klay, lebron honestly cant ask for anything better with his contract Lmaooo I dont think it will, clearly pels arent doing a swap with the lakers. So they need another team I respect the lakers for trying Ethier way even if they dont get Ad the chances of him coming after next year are still high Theres still some hope Damn, Radio groped a chick? Radio? Cuba Cooding Jr *gooding Oh Im shocked! God I need this AD trade done Gunde getting that rent money off this AD clout forgot to tell you guys I met with the founder of Overtime yesterday and he is such a nerd and its awesome ?Gotta say not sure who I rather have Hmmmmmmmm ??

Thomas doesnt get the credit he deserves for sure He wasnt great but somehow made it work Alejandro Maldonado. Most underrated duck of all time? ?? Dont irk me Dubov Wow Masoli didnt die to be compared to Darren Thomas Darren Thomas died so Marcus could win the Heisman He was the Ken Dorsey of Oregon football He sucked overall but he was a legend for us Actual question at trivia tonight: yes or no: the Portland trailblazers have made the nba finals Im happy to report every team got it right. Thank the fucking lord ? ATP - Stuttgart bout to pop off @ 3:30 am! KAREN! Hes my favorite player No joke Karen caught the L ?? Wow thats devastating He played so fucking well at Roland Garros. My man was on a heater. Just broke into the top 10 world ranking The guy just crumbled under pressure like he was a nuclear reactor core in late 80s Ukraine Morning fuckers Who wants to gamble! I do. Give me that tasty, tasty draw in Australia v Brazil Im sitting about 10 feet away from LeBron in the cafeteria right now. Should I ask him if he wants any action, Space? Yes You definitely should Ask him if he could use any extras in Space Jam Rengel I feel like you could be a good stand in for one of the Monstars when they do the green screen stuff That would be amazing lol Id like to see what happens when the monsters steal javale mgees talent Lets hope this movie inspires Meyers Leonard to transform to an all star ? ? Blazers need to bring him back to Rip City and get him sponsored by Stumptown Come on you cowards Western conference At home!

Basketball never stops So if Klay and KD are both out for basically the whole season, where does golden state end up? Like a 4 seed? https://twitter.com/sinow/status/1139547306548764674?s=21 Honestly man It could be worse? Were gonna learn a lot about Steve Kerr! Like they could be worse than four For them its about as bad as it gets But Durant gonna stay now True Also what's KD's performance gonna be like? Nobody has gotten even close to full form after an Achilles tear And him and klay are gonna come back for the playoffs Im all for it You saw how well that worked out for Boogie Kd might sit out all next yr I hope he goes to NY Wow way to go KD Ruin the nba AGAIN! The nba is finally back. Offseason gonna be even crazier than ppl thought Not to discredit the playoffs cuz those were the best in a long time Did you see those odds? So dope So many deals if you have a feeling Ya I dont get how Portland is so low Essentially they think nyk is gonna get everything Honestly its better for us Dame keeps the chip on his shoulder that way O ya thats cool - still weird tho. Id expect at least top 8 odds Why doesn't Kyrie just go join lebron and AD in LA? They'd win the west easy He probably wants to win one without LeBron Ok come down blazers fans. We werent even supposed to make the playoffs this year and way overachieved. We should definitely be ahead of NO/OKC/DAL but were not too far below where we belong Fuck the warriors karma is a bitch The NBA is gonna be great next year! Neil go get Kevin Love Its time Lets take the fucking west I want the raptors! Gundy what about a S&T for Tobias Harris? Idk whats in it for philly lol Cavs have no draft capital If he says he's gone and wants to come to Portland They recoup some assets Ok fair enough Kevin love is an expensive backup for AD imo https://twitter.com/danwolken/status/1139555306889854976?s=21 I hope that Canada says fuck you were not extraditing him and then Trump starts another trade war https://www.instagram.com/tv/Bysntadh6mw/?igshid=l0bzspbindc4 This was dope Warriors should tell the police officer to stop pursing it. Lol what! They pushed eachother big deal. Get over it and move on What do the warriors have to do with it Id assume the warriors have some influence in their local police dpt They definitely pay them to work games Its not like he stabbed him The crime is one thing idc The warriors shouldnt have anything to do with it You really think the president of the warriors (or someone high up) doesnt have influence/ talk to someone at the local police force In todays current social media world Yah why is that a good thing ??????? ??????? I thought I lived under a rock Also the cop clearly made a mistake and is just doubling down in a really dumb way Like just let it go He also lied about Masai not having a credential he was carrying it in his right hand lol Sure but lets not call on corporations to run the legal system Unless that corporation manufactures really expensive basketball shoes imo BBB Legal! Has that company completely dissolved? Somehow, no Even tho Lonzo covered his tat And is very nakedly trying to get a Nike deal Weird If the Bulls replace LaVine with Lonzo Im jumping on the Bulls Bandwagon How are you guys celebrating trumps birthday? I got a piata I put a fence up in my yard Did Mexico pay for it? ? Yah bullshit Copa America is poppin on espn plus https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1140023139142971392?s=21 Holy shit Nice haul griff They could have had future hall of famer Zac Collins! I mean who's the all star in the trade? When is the draft CJ is better than all them Thursday mark Also I think this is pretty great for the pelicans, theyre gonna have a fun young team Damnnn good haul for both Cant wait for Neils comment They should trade Jrue Holiday to a contender Add Randle to the mix and they're just the 2018 lakers plus holiday and Zion lol Plus the #4 pick Oh true Garland would be nasty Griff has said he wants a mix of young talent and vets to make the playoffs this year tho Ill take Jrue So I think holiday stays I'm actually a fan of the hybrid approach of late twenties studs and young guys versus completely bottoming out Lakers sign Kawhi? Thatd be ?? Lebron doesn't wanna play second fiddle to the Klaw tho Kawai would be dope or even kemba Kemba with those 2 would be money Lol so it was magic fucking everything up Or Kyrie??? Kemba would be great How about a return of D-Lo to the lakers? Kyrie is a certified crazy person Kyrie going to the Nets Man that defense if kawai went there Will josh Hart he playing in China in 4 years? Kemba should go to the Knicks with KD. Kyrie to the Nets. D-Lo to the Lakers. Kawhi to the clippers Josh Hart is dope. Jodie Meeks just got a ring anything is possible Well Lonzo Ingram Zion and whoever goes #4 is a good young crew Who would you take to win a ship in 10 years. Dallas or NO Theyll need wings and center Wow great question Brock Dallas, because that European guy is legit a star Zion is a star too tho Naw hes a bust Anthony Bennett 2.0 Lol Thats a good corner big dog Plus you know Cuban will always spend money to get the team he needs Dallas Zion is a HOFer already book it Luka for real ? Lukas game will age great Zion is Reliant on his athleticism like Blake And everyones doing steroids now a day so their bodies are failing Blake just put up 25/8/5 in year 10 What's your point Bad shot by Justin rose wow Blake got bopped in the nose by a ball boy. Hes shot Klay Thompson to LA would be wild Lol Matt https://twitter.com/thesteinline/status/1140026897801318400?s=21 I'm calling it right now. Russel is gonna go back to LA and Kyrie signs with the Nets Also Jimmy Butler! If the clippers can trade Gallinari they could sign two max players Kawhi and Jimmy or Kawhi and Klay would be dope Russel is not going back to LA I think its Kemba Why not Brock He already said hed do less than the super max Blazers should get galinari Not sure why either side would want to do business with each other I think Kemba stays east Although lmao I guess the lakers would look pretty smart trading a player who then just comes back and signs with them Why not? The only blocker was magic after he trashed Russell and he's gone I think kemba wants a ring and Lebron can get him that It's a new regime in LA. No hard feelings Welp so much for the blazers Yah thats seems like a good fit Dehaan Kemba Lebron kuz and AD? Thats pretty solid if you ask me Yeah good on pelinka for keeping kuzma A rich mans klay Thomsons ACL! Soooo blazers need to do
Something right? We already on now worse than lakers Are Like Neils got to realize that Might be a deadline deal for the zers but dont see anything happening now Who's our targets Blake and Love? Lets sign Wilson Chandler 2 years too late I still think a Tobias S&T could be a sleeper if dame can recruit him Sucks Ian stoped looking at the life chat. You think he knows about the trade yet? Liga * Chris Paul requesting a trade (?) Hes probably pacing around his house knowing the west is definitely better than the east again Think about this. Tobias tells philly "I'm leaving but I really wanna go to Portland if y'all wanna recoup some assets. They don't have cap room"

Portland trades Moe, Meyers and a first and second for Tobias. 

Philly gets two bodies for depth and a first round pick for a guy who was leaving anyway. Moe and Meyers both have 1 year left so it's low risk if they suck That would be sweet but why would Harris want to come to pdx Trust me Im all for it But no medium names let alone semi big want to come to pdx if their choice Dame and CJ? Idk lol That would be sick lineup with Nurk back! Oh I feel you. But maybe the tides are turning Neil just needs to fucking get some balls and take a chance You guys surprised AD wont sign extension but wait? Probably wants to see what playing with Lebron is truly like before committing to it? Is there no cap flexibility for the lakers if he waits? Feel like you can lod up on FA and then extend your guys to go over Idktho Ohhh good call Yeh I have no idea Chad? You are our cap guru lol I think its for cap reasons Also extensions unless they are supermax The extension wouldn't kick in until next season so it wouldn't affect cap room this summer But if they strike out this summer on a third star, they could do 1 year deals again and sign one next summer. Then extend AD Hence the waiting Are worse for the players usually Gundy, text terry and get his opinion on the trade Can we add terry to the superliga group?? Also AD probably wants to wait and see what the squad can do. Win win for player and team Gundy if we add him warn him against Kevin ware jokes beforehand How awesome would that be, especially if it was right in the middle of one of our east vs west debates Pelicans might trade #4?! For what Gaggle of picks from Atlanta Disgruntled second tier player? I read Griff wants playoffs year 1 What if he did #4, Randle and others for Beal or something https://ftw.usatoday.com/2017/06/lakers-magic-johnson-lonzo-ball-retire-jersey-nba-draft #tbt The pelicans are gonna be interesting Not good but just interesting with Zion and that young core League pass team Could be playoff That team is gonna play elite defense on day q 1 https://twitter.com/bosnianbeast27/status/1140045428290813952?s=21 What this Making fun of the pelicans lmao Gotcha I think anyway Thats the shirt AD wire Probably reference to ads shirt too Wore https://twitter.com/jordanclarksons/status/1140044694338121729?s=21 Uhhhh He's just trolling But could happen Phoenix would be a good spot for him ? All players on cover jerseys retired Removed a like from an image Honestly LeBron is old and Davis is injury prone Us and Denver have as good of a chance as anyone to get out of the west Lavar has spoken Zach is the AD stopper A modern day Ruben Patterson https://twitter.com/reallakersofla/status/1140074139446677504?s=21 Lakers could be targeting role guys https://twitter.com/johnnynba/status/1140084527081152513?s=21 If we get Blake LFG It even Love We would have three of the best five players in any series Love is still better than Kuz https://twitter.com/bobbymarks42/status/1140096513185595392?s=21 Wait there was unprotected pick swaps 6 years from now? Lol Lakers r dum https://twitter.com/timbontemps/status/1140085647543193601?s=21 Is there an echo Its worth it with LeBron Theyve been irrelevant for 6 years I feel like they were unnecessary tho. Bidding against themselves at that point Brooklyn 2.0 Whoa thats cool Couldn't they protect the pick swaps? You think griff walks away if they protect them? ?More riveting analysis from Maroney Idk about you guys but my take is that NO came out pretty good here. Also Lakers got what they needed for LeBron. Just my take no one elses tho. Lol The Lakers wont win a championship by the time were grandparents Ive said it once Ill say it again That's like 15 years for you. I could see that ?? Damn those picks are a great haul https://www.instagram.com/p/ByxoNZmDpou/?igshid=1tj4t7cbrcfta I'm here with fun guy ?? https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1140296688650903553?s=12 ?? Are they all Fucking stupid What is going on Well the Pelicans also lose cap space if they wait But some people are saying if they get a free agent commitment the Lakers will offer New Orleans another pick swap lol This is absurd. So only AD wins in this scenario And only partially cuz he loses out on an all star teammate AD can also give them more space By waiving all or part of his trade bonus Well theyre gonna suck idk how they can sign a legit bench or role players like do they get reddick and Danny green? Lol lakers Twitter is like well Zion will be ready to request a trade in 2024 so we good whose their PG? Seth curry probably If they have max space they can get Kemba But AD would have to waive his bonus To get the max Pressure is on Klutch to walk the walk Klutch looks good here. They get their clients what they want That's what I'm saying gundy is AD is the only winner keeping his bonus Pelicans lose space
Lakers lose space
AD gets $4 mil If AD isnt out of his mind good then hes a bitch You got what you want no go be great like you can no whining He wanted out from NO and got it, and now he's gonna sabotage their chances to be better? He's bout to make $200 mil+ on his extension and probably makes $15 mil a year in endorsements Give up the $4 mil dollar bonus you pussy Im saying Brock he now cant complain that hes in LA and doesnt like playing with lebron and has no help But the issue is now bron and AD have crippled them to build a team. I guess if they get kemba itll be fine Like is Bron and AD better combo than Russ and PG? Two guys isnt enough. Short answer, yes. But I agree with your point Bron and AD is pretty much equal to steph and KD Now they gotta find their Klay Yes theyre both better Or maybe just get Klay I know theyre better But like is it enough or just a lose in the first round team. Realistically how long will lebron be able to play at this level, he really is extraordinary Btw happy Father's Day Dylan. I apologize for making a degrading joke about Sage I think he's got at least 3 years of 25+ ppg in him Vlon VleVlalf vlof vle VluperVliga Vlappy Vlathers Vlay Thanks man I got the best present ever. The lakers ruining their franchise for 20 years Happy Fathers Day dylan Gsw Lakers wcf would be great Blazers lakers better Blazers have a lot of pieces in the air. Im not sold on them until we see how FA shakes out. The lakers will get blazers because with two superstars players who want a ship will go there Who else do the lakers have though? who can shoot? Whos your favorite team Houman? The nets after they get kyrie Blazers but Im always going to be very skeptical of them until proven otherwise. This year wasnt enough for me to be proven just yet Can we get an explanation of pick swaps? What if hypothetically pels pick in 23 is better than lakers pick... can they decline the pick swap League is open - lakers might be 2nd best team in LA after free agency Yes Houman Its optional Thats why theyre great The ultimate GM v GM gamble Lol mandatory pick swap would be a hell of gamble Houman we just made the WCF what is it gonna take for you to show an ounce of optimism We're gonna win a ship

Houman: "I'm still not sold on this team until they prove they can repeat. Who says this wasn't a fluke?" Lol
Houman never cheers for his team He was rooting for the Seahawks their super bowl season but not until the Parade He also thought the Ducks sucked with chip Kelly ? Everyone who moves to NYC sucks Blazers did great but we were a game 7 away from not making the wcf. Plus we played the nuggets who Im sorry arent anywhere near a championship level. Had we been in the rockets tier we most likely wouldnt have gone through without nurik. Now if we had nurik healthy I would have been all about it Im a realist not an optimist when it comes to the blazers.... too many let downs for that Also dylan nyc is where its eat. Where else can I hangout with Dehaans people the walk 3 blocks and hangout with osamas people then walk 3 more blocks and hangout with Marus arrelonos people then walk another 3 blocks and hangout with black ppl (I forgot the token black kid in our frat) At* You lost me at Nurik Toronto was game 7 away from not making it to ECF...good logic Houman Lol do you think Toronto fans are saying that? Toronto doesnt deserve the ship Marus arrelono? Lol Is that a Greek friend of ours? Nah the Mexican dude in our frat The one that did education with Dehaan Hes now the oc for the ducks Lol of all the way you can describe him thats what you go with? I mean how else would you have liked me to go about it Lol Dylan is correct tho - he was a Greek friend of ours Greek brother https://www.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/c180lj/this_man_inadvertently_got_us_ad_thank_you_kyrie/ https://twitter.com/dril/status/1140384161993093120?s=21 Im sold https://twitter.com/trailblazers/status/1140386066664312832?s=12 Swanigan 2.0?

But I agree https://twitter.com/paulcrane7/status/1140955562139631617?s=21 Whoa Young Love No dude thats not what they want They want cap space in 2020 Which is where Portlands expirings come in baby!!!! Expirings plus no.25 for Kevin Omg Make it happen Then Neil can spin 2016 summer as a win "We don't make this deal if I didn't sign so many shitty contracts that summer ? Im key bump pumped for the new look pels We're gonna be doing so many lines next season Dylan That edited photo is wildly inaccurate. Four of the six players should be on the bench with injuries. Theyre gonna be the first team I play with on 2K20 Idk why there are rumors swirling about the Lakers trying to get PatBev when they already have the perfect PG ? I just met Mike Barretts niece. She scheduled an informational interview with me and she definitely name dropped him If you werent in a happy relationship Id tell you to drop your balls on her chin *zing* ?

Wait really??? How would we get him lol He's very sophisticated would definitely fit in in Portland I meant we will take him lol Super liga sources Harrison Barnes sign and trade?? He's no Aaron afflalo Horford would be amazing here But I like the love Atlanta 3 way idea Yes Thursday is almost here! I wonder if horford will end up regretting not taking the 30 million this year https://tradenba.com/trades/BJqDEiUkS With so many teams having room next year too Send Atlantas second to Cleveland if we have to What does Atlanta gain out of that? They basically traded 

8 + 17 for 5
Crabbe + 10 for 25? And our shitty players They get to move up to 5 for their trouble and get another swing at 25 If they absorbed love they wouldnt have cap space in 2020 Or as much They already have 8, 10 and 17 They could trade 8 and 17 and move up to 5 Or 8 and 10 and keep 17 It depends how much they like who is available at 5 I guess Cleveland makes out like bandits basically getting #10 for Love and getting off his money Like if they think Culver is the right fit They get their guy at 5 ? I think it'd have to be something like:

Atlanta gets
ET
Meyers
#5

Cleveland gets
Crabbe
#8
#17
#25

Portland gets
Love Atlanta keeps 10 Ok cool then do that deal lol But I think the Cavs want 8 and 10 And I want a supermodel lol If that's a deal breaker than so be it. But I would never do that if I'm Atalanta https://twitter.com/giannis_an34/status/1141144781684445185?s=21 Lets trade dame and CJ in two 3 way trade for multiple 2022 picks in the double draft and just give up Houman might like that idea No no I would want nurik gone also lol Oh my bad Maybe we can get him for 6 future 2nd round picks Whos Nurik? Thats more like it dylan ?Lol love the second response Pourmecoffee is one of my favorite accounts. Specially his trump replies Congrats Gundy on the tie. Very impressive At Brazil... thats crazy Only took 11 minutes of stoppage time and VAR to finish it but I will take it We just gotta beat Bolivia This USMNT v Guyana game is the crappiest crap Ive ever watched Why is John strong calling this game instead of the real national team in France? What is this double draft? I think he means its the one when preps to pros is legal again ? ? Homemade hot sauce Calling it ReHabenero https://twitter.com/clipperkyle/status/1141349680783286284?s=21 Lmao Rengel works for first take?? Only on Wednesdays And I dont think CP3 was mad about him starting the fire. It was that he lied about it https://twitter.com/rolling_rock/status/1138801968107966464?s=12 ^best promoter post ever Is Middleton really a max guy? Conley to Utah Holy shit Thats where everyone was expecting him to go tho Another west team gets better. Your move Neil Not going to find anyone who doesnt like that fit Utah gave up a whole lot of nothing for him Yea not a bad trade How many good years left does he have? Maybe 2? Denver 1, Utah 2, PDX 3, lakers 4 West rankings right now? True but they have Mitchell and gobert Id say lakers more like 6.7 depending on the rest of that roster True they could still kinda suck Lol no way Utah is a 2 Really? You dont think Conley elevates them at all? I many rockets are blowing it up and curry has to have an MVP season thru April if theyll be better than like a 7 seed The west is wide open They already had Rubio who wasn't terrible. So it's not a massive jump from last year Fair enough Not like they had Steve Blake out there I agree with dylan. Utah Pdx Nuggets all could be in any order Rubio is nothing like Conley. Hes not a threat to shoot Mitchell could take another step though Yeah Clearly they're different players Houman I mean just name me better teams in the west right now Conley can pull up from three, always way more flow seperwtiom for Mitchell I'm just saying he was an above average pg I agree with that Thunder and spurs arent making any moves are they? Warriors will be 7 seed caliber till April. LeBron & AD > Conley & Gobert & Mitchell Mitchell > Zach Collins Kawhi & Sweet Lou & Danilo & Montrezl > Conley & Gobert & Mitchell Kawhi is staying im convinced Let's hope so. We don't need another west juggernaut No way hes staying in Toronto Gundy Dubov wager Let's see it I will bet 20 That he stays Length does not matter ??bet Love it And gundy that's what I tell my lady too Dont think Rubio above average pg He helps you win but idk if he should be your starting point guard Would def take 20 guys over him Phoenix needs him 20 guys?! That's absurd That would be perfect Maybe 15 Harden, curry, Kyrie, Lillard, Kemba, Conley, Westbrook, ben, Paul, Russell, holiday, fox, wall , Brogdon, young, Lowry, Murray, dragic, Thats 18 Caruso 19 If the Lakers were smart Caruso is starting for them next season I wouldn't call harden or Brogdon pg's. And wall is out for the year But touch He's not a world beater Gundy - point of clarification on our bet... are we talking $20USD or $20 Canadian? USD Ok cool I dont want any of those fucking loonies ?Sick burn Meyers Expose him !!!! Lol I take it the Meyers redemption tour has run its course Redemption tour bus exploded Man you guys pumped for the draft? Ya State Farm is sponsoring! Yeah baby we are getting Kevin Love! (Speak it into existence) Were getting love Is that how you do it gundy Love is love Wait thats a different message Live Love Laugh I bet Meyers has that hanging in his living room somewhere Kyrie going to nets its a lock. A friend of a friend said he moved into a place in jersey city Mitorabi ?? Kyrie is too hip to live in Brooklyn he has to live in jersey wow Mirtorabi* Idk thats not what it says in my phone Mine says Mitorabi too. Chances are Houman got it wrong like Nurik Houman you may be the worst speller I've ever met It's impressive PFT Commenter of our group Not to be outshined by marks talent of making up last names of athletes You cant get Houman MittoRomney with Mirtorabi Chad the ironic part is Im

Which means you fit right in Lowe said Crowder could be had for 2 2nds. I'd take him over harkless Did Sam Jacobs get into Meth? ? Yikes Don't do drugs kids This is what I envisioned happening to spaceman if he did Molly when I was a naive freshmen I mean it's not far off Jesus he looks awful every colt story gets more depressing ?

What Ararat!!! Link me!!!! I need to write this https://twitter.com/shamscharania/status/1141504094022045699?s=21 Thank you Do you think the WNBA players are gonna make 30% as much as the NBA players? I guarantee you theyll all get equal pay and itll be used as a promotional piece How many points is AD gonna get on the backend if he agrees to waive that $4MM trade kicker? LeBron also def tried to get Nike only guys first and couldnt lol Mark lmao true Thats totally gonna happen LeBron tries to be woke through content The monstars are gonna take the nba players talent and the WNBA players will still be unable to beat the nba players Cant wait for the episode of The Shop that only has cast members They need an episode of the shop IN space jam 2 Goddamn Rengel I just spit out my beer Id be so annoyed if the franchise I rooted for ever sold a pick Same We dont think we can improve at all https://twitter.com/bleacherreport/status/1141520440726183937?s=21 Come again? They're gonna turn down Kyrie? Are they high? I love the nba Ok Im ready for some WOJ bombs about our team I hope tomorrow turns out as good as the hype Would you all like ET, meyers/harkless and #25 and potential future 1st for Otto porter? Heard that today on podcast Otto would be amazing. I'd be hesitant on two firsts tho I would be down but I want buckets Maybe one of those heavily protected ones that turns into two 2nds if it doesn't convey year one Ive become more reductive the longer Ive done this Buckets >>> everything else Love > porter to me I think we make that same trade for Love. Then trade two 2nds for Crowder Is buckets meaning love? Down for that! I like crowder Is Memphis already trying to move him? I saw it on twitter yeah. Don't know how valid it is tho Would you give turner and 25 to Memphis for nothing The Millsap Stopper For Dillon Brooks Paul couldnt figure out ET! Turner is Sudoko for Stretch Fours They have a huge trade exception How many years left on ET? Last year But if we unload him before free agency we can sign someone? Hey whats this situation with Adidas not being able to trademark? Trading ET for nothing doesn't do anything for us except save tax dollars So I would not do that Guys we are Portland cap space is a fallacy come on It moves our midlevel up $4million I heard 6 > 10 That may be but is it worth it that bad Idk thats why I asked I dont think signing a mid level guy I don't think so Brock We'd have to renounce Aminu in that case Should be the motivation for trading turner like that Ahh I didnt even know that but more reason not to So if we wanna lose Aminu and Turner and the 25 pick and replace him with a MLE guy. That'd be the choice Offer Hood the taxpayer MLE if he takes it great if he doesnt someone will Lets be honest, are we finding the next sleeper this draft or are we gonna blow it on Nolan Smith 2.0? Yeah the taxpayer MLE on a 3 year deal with raises isn't bad at all I hope Hood takes it Mark that's a question as old as time itself I dont know who else is offering him more Cant wait for a... WHITE GUY! Houston has interest but they dont have the full MLE I'm with gundy. Use 25 for a K Love trade Neils drafted a white every draft right? Thats some Charlottesville shit right there I was gonna say the Lakers if they get desperate. But Hood won't go back with Lebron so they're out Holy shit Mark you're right But I think that was PA's call He loved him a white Word on the street is jody may have different Tastes He drafted Jeff Withey!!! Remember when Neil blamed Paul for being too attached to our draft picks after the deadline???? Actually Brock I take that back. If we renounced Hood instead of Aminu, and trade ET for nothing I think we get to the full MLE So if we're losing Rodney anyway, that could be a move. Assuming we have a target for the MLE He spit on his grave gundy! Do we love the Morris brothers that much?!? Jody can back that money truck up and pay any tax. Right after she backs that ass up What's your guys thoughts on Roberson? Versus Harkless I love Robersons game but I feel like hes always injured? True. Missed a whole season which is risky Hes worse at offense Better at defense Pass Trade out of first round and get Love and take Schofield in earlyish 2nd Although that would mean Rachel DeMita comes to more games so Im for that Alright gundy what's your official blazers big board tonight GRANT Thats my big board I want grant Williams Good defender, strong, accomplished scorer in college I love grant Williams Need a real grinder a real Nolan Smith Grant Williams should come to Portland and wear 44 a la Brian grant Okay I like Grant Im just afraid hes gone before 25 Im also afraid if he is Neil is gonna ignore fit and pick another guard I subscribe to the draft best available school of thought I kinda like Matisse. Or Brandon Clarke if he falls I subscribe to wings only Yeah I mean I think the consensus on this draft is there are more good forward and centers than guards in this years class Big men and PGs are plentiful and gettable anytime Gundy what about Mr double dribble himself Ty Jerome if he's still there. Could play the ET role off the bench Yeah wings win games. I agree Brock Grant is like the ideal fit and hes likely the BPA at 25 Ty Jerome is a shooter right? He's a shooter and ball handler at 6'5 Virginia PG Sign me up Sports illustrated also said we are trying to buy into the 2nd round I got my poor mans Donovan Mitchell guy too Talen Horton-Tucker. 6'4 bully with 7'1 wingspan Played at Simeon HS I love ty Jerome so much Jason McIntyre has us taking Luegentz Dort Good thing mike rice isn't here cuz he wouldn't be able to pronounce that If our son Bol Bol drops, are we taking him? I see a Robert Williams/Jared Sullinger esque drop in play with that foot injury Ive also heard he had terrible interviews Lotta questions about whether he loves the game enough But a lot of people say he could be a top 5 guy in the class when its all said and done Big Wings. https://twitter.com/foreskingawd/status/1141490641093873664?s=12 That is fucking ruthless lol Jfc ?Friday when u just got paid Lol wait who died Yea who dead Len bias ?

Its the first time theyll be motivated in like 2 years gonna be a great game Guys tonight's the night we round out the big 3 Kevin Love is coming home This is not going to work lol When we have 3 blazers on Team USA at the World Championships >>>> Lol I want it too But I have a feeling tonights group text is going to be around Neil not making a movie Move Think positive!!! I hope Im wrong! Neil is and always will be a cuck. It is known! Yeah let's be honest guys, we're totally fucked. But until then I'm gonna live in fantasy land and think good thoughts Somebody call me in 6 hours to make sure I haven't jumped off the edge yet ESPNs 7th seed prediction for the 5th year in a row may be right this time 2 goals for USWNT Cmon Sweden give me a fucking goal WWZD Boooo push Gunde, TJ Warren would be tight Hows his defense? God bob Sarver is such a cheap fuck Defense is below average but he's a certified bucket getter And he randomly developed a 3 point shot last year Higher ceiling than Hood dont @ me Griffin is wheeling and dealing Where is sideline olshey Garland going 6 I just entered the bathroom while chewing gum and immediately thought to myself this is gross and spit it out in toilet. Over reaction or smart move ? I feel like that's a curb debate topic It does not appear that I can bet NBA draft on BetOnline Probably an over reaction but I feel I do the same most of the time in that situation I saw a guy take his coffee into the bathroom the other day Fucking psychopath I just got to Tualatin I will tell you if I see anything What you guys think of the Atlanta and Minnesota traces? Trades Seems like good deal for NO if they werent sold on anyone at 4 If youre not picking #1, you might as well trade your picks to get what you need. Lil Nas X to Memphis Intros for he green room lmao who's idea was this The nfl Pretty soft if you ask me I wanna see one of them slide to the 40's A la Majec Lampe Bol Bol looks like an idiot lol What the hell is that suit When league fits starts saying he's gonna win drip rookie of the year I realize I know nothing about style I agree he looks ridiculous Lmao Knicks fans are real ones for booing the raptors If the pelicans use all five minutes they should lose all future first round picks No take your damn time Im on the subway! Lol listening to local LA am radio and Byron Scott just threw his old Cavs GM under the bus. He said the year they took Kyrie #1 they had #4 too and they worked out Klay multiple times and he told GM to take him #4 but GM said no that's too high I mean they got dion so its really a wash anyway imo I think I want rui if we can get him But if not Lets take a swing at one of the guards Porter or Langford I think porter will be gone No way! Well I dunno unless theres been recent developments everyone said he was a stretch for Miami Lmao the Team Needs for the Knicks was literally Everything. Starters and bench.

Reece taking shot at porzingis I like RJ Ya I think his game translates more to nba Cam is the wildcard Guys let's all remember some of the greatest analysis in sports history. Zion could be the best player in the draft, but don't be surprised if he isn't either This stuff is tough!! Cavs going Sexton/Garland back to back lol great drafting Wow Gunz, Ropp calling on you on 1080 Regarding the Kevin Love comments Im sorry did Woj just say the Cavs are thinking the eastern conference version of Dame & CJ?

Hes one of the best shooters in ncaa history 0-12 is pretty bad lol For sure. Its terrible. But you cant judge a player based on one game. That would be the most idiotic assessment ever. Damn mark Congrats on your achievement You made the most idiotic assessment ever Where do we send your award? The SuperLiga archives of Shame Brock can you actually start archiving the dumbest takes in this chat for our year in review? Any post with a ?? is considered a nomination I like where this is going Space is inherently anti the rest of the group tho so wouldn't he have a disproportionate share of nominations ? Or is that how it should be given his cantankerous nature? It probably evens out We can vote at the end of the month for the top 3 worst to move on to the end of the year award for worst take? Not my fault the east has the four best teams Bill Simmons said they move too fast through the draft picks What the fuck is he talking about The draft was like 12 hours long Lmao naw naw naw Ya Rengel i like that filter Otherwise we'll have space poking the bear too much He gets his rocks off when the group turns against him 0-12 from 3 is www.dogshit.com That guy will think about that game for the rest of his life While he plays in the Romanian A league ^brock plz collect this evidence for future posterity lol youre an idiot If he goes off like he did in the previous games, he has crazy coverage. Pistons draft him in the second round Steph Curry is in the NBA only because of March madness Not even 9 am pacific and we got a cantankerous mention The New York Times crossword cant fuck with the Superliga Do you really truly believe that adding the best shooter in the ncaa to your **summer league** team is a mistake? Worst case scenario he lives up to this rep youve created for him and thats it for him Best case scenario he lights it up and you add him to the end of the bench for a team that thrives on spot up shooting Great troll by the big dawg to start off the morning I also think lebron only made it on his physical attributes Jalen rose and Lavar needs get in the octagon and settle this Bro Tyler herro ROY Volume scorer! I mean I still dunno how I feel about the pick But I love the heat actually swung on a guy whos all offense And hes young too not like Ellington who is in the twilight of his career Whens the last time the heat had a young exciting offensive player? Precisely I thought they were gonna draft sekou I wanted Langford but Im drinking the kool aid CBS sports gave us an A draft grade! Bummed about bol bol Pat Riley is also a Kentucky guy Feel like okpala could be a steal Lotta mocks had us taking him at 25 Gundy we basically got OG now just 2 years late Well if hes OG he can play right away Let's hope we get McDonald's mvp Nassir Also I can't believe OG missed the entire championship run with an appendicitis. Rub some Fucking dirt on it Conor did an entire SigEp Sunriver with appendicitis Tyler Herro is white JR The prophecy has come true He is the White One White flight! Miami Heat = Red Pill ?? Tyler Herro is Marine Todd With a blaccent The last white man in Miami Should win some oscars ^ audible laughter in the office When Tyler Herro is in the new Stitches video >>> Lol saw he got arrested with drugs and a bunch of guns https://images.app.goo.gl/owm9fQETTqxrAFdy9 Damnit didnt send the gif Nooooooooo But this guy? Who would have thought! ? Guns and drugs!? Seems off brand God dammit. Real awkward office moment Did u shart? Thats not awkward thats completely natural. Shame on you, Matty. Yeah Chad said the n word on accident thats my guess Fucking shart shamer Maybe for a troglodyte like u Clayton More like as if he was quoting a song tho not like trump style Wow Matty I cant see you up on your fucking throne New guy was asking this try hard on my team about logging overtime hours. Of course the try hard gives him terrible advice. So I G-chat the kid and I'm like 

"yo don't listen to max, everyone logs 10 hours overtime a week even if we don't work it. It'll get approved"

Then I look over and the new guy calls over Max to have him help him. Max goes open your email. Then I'm staring at his computer like don't do it. Opens his email and my G chat is right there just talking mad shit about Max I like to think Clayton sharts all the time and then goes to hr when people make
Fun of him I'm like dawg, cover your fucking chat window better than that Jesus Chad thats brutal Omg lol Also since when did we shame sharts? Time to sell your house U gotta change schools and move now Im kind of saddened the chat is acting this way Last time you try and help that homie Well I beat you to it Matt but yours was better That guy is an enemy for life Its real awkward in here boys Fuck that new guy my god God I used to do that in Miami Shart? I mean down there its so swampy its impossible to know if you did or not But my base pay was like 6 cents so I felt it was my right Yeah i had to quit shafting in Chicago because it would freeze and get stuck to my leg God dammit That was great The Chicago freeze The trouser slushy Wow real high brow stuff clay Lol a real tweet from a girl I went to HS with ? ? Lmaoooooo The high brow art of Dont Mess With the Zohar Zohan Wow space were really on the same wave length today Back to back move posts followed by back to back Sandler posts Riding the wave! Whats overtime? When Monsanto comes to town I think were missing the biggest point from yesterday.... did Neil do good? Yes Plenty of time to make a move still Blazersedge is saying we let Aminu walk now. Gotta preserve all our assets IMO If we can get him on the cheap might as well keep him Jin Yang is in Portland this weekend Agreed 10 mil would be max I pay His playoff run honestly may have helped Did you know he shot close to 40 percent from 3 in the previous 3 postseasons? Jin Yang, Cams BFF Cam can you request some tix for me? Ill make a call Honestly was drunk as shit when I met him. I think he hated me I was kidding - thats be awesome tho lol Cam drunk as shit meeting an Asian? Probably tried to smash So if golden states does this delayed S&T with Durant, shouldn't we trade CJ for him? I wonder what a trade like that would look like Bol Bo(w)l #BlazeTheNugz https://twitter.com/got_the_glow/status/1141916882817019904?s=12 ?Friday just got paid mood https://twitter.com/i/events/1142497087038189568 https://twitter.com/reignsupremely/status/1142659840713662464?s=21 ? ?6 years ago. Never forget. https://twitter.com/channingfrye/status/1142942514325757954?s=21 Channing sees the vision What do we need to give up? Collins Little Dont you think we wouldve already done the trade then? They probably want more then I would give them Trent Or if I gave them Simons I dont give them anyone else but I dont wanna give up Simons I saw gary Trent at quickfish in the Pearl last Sunday Hes not as big as me I could fight him ? The hero Portland needs. And Kevin Love. BAZEGOD I like it LFG Wow One shitty contract for another shitty contract Like it for both teams Thank god no more ET Eyyyy Yeah but this new shitty contract can shoot the ball Is this good? When is basemore done yes Atlanta is going to love ET. Theyll be able to tank another year Next summer Same length as ET I actually like it Nassir Little very similar player ET hated Terry too didn't he Seems like a good move Prolly plays same amount defense inferior rebounding I guess Can he run the point with the second unit? He had decent handles with the warriors Nah baze cant run the point Base averaging 11/4/2 vs ET 7/4/4 He can hit a corner 3 tho Honestly he could be better than mo in some lineups right? I mean I know hes not a superb rebounder Basemore shot worse than Aminu from 3 last year For the hawks A team that couldnt create much of anything on offense He will be wide open a lot Hes shooting 32% on the year with 4.5 attempts a game Not great! Yikes right On a team where he was one of the best players lol Well hes not ET tho so do we care? lol Quinten Richardson COULD BAZEMORE STOP MILSAP THOUGH?!?!?!?!? Perfect guy to give a chance to play w dame Lol 32% is 32% He could improve ET is ET At the end of the day I like it Hes the best bench guy enthusiasm wise in the league Plays great on the fast break And is a ball hawk Wow Woj already saying we won't be able to afford Hood back Hes not wrong Rodney should be getting decent offers. But if we can keep kanter Im happy Maybe someone will be dumb enough to take Myers Do we get his co podcast host Vince Carter too? ? I'd take Hood over Kanter if I had to choose Agreed but I think hood will get better offers, and I think kanter likes how Portland gave him a chance https://twitter.com/chriskirschner/status/1143254814010368009?s=21 When we get referred to as a contender ?

This is about as low risk as they come Man Im over this intro on the nba awards IM SO PROUD OF MY SLOVENIAN SON Well deserved Damn Boom Dizzles sweater is ?????? Robin Roberts out here trying to make me cry For a defensive POY Rudy goberts suit sure is offensive ?Vlade got a vote lol Lmao Vlade and Morey finished tied? ? Ok.... Few people wear a suit better than magic YES GIANNIS Fire olshey. Picked CJ over the MVP ?Terry didn't get one vote?! ? God Kobe is like magic except its always to give himself credit for others success Retired Kobe is the man. I'm here for all of it https://twitter.com/houstonrockets/status/1143358248277499905?s=12 lmao this is so lame Its an entire thread The top check point or whatever is funny Why should harden be mvp? Well he finished top two the last two seasons!! ? Steph ahead of Dame in mvp voting is garbage Lol is it? Steph did average 27? Dame next ? Love ETs last line lol Shoutout Conor McGregor ?Here you go space I'm taking dames season all day Not up for discussion! Why? All star teammates: ZERO Why Steph? Cuz he averaged 1 point more than dame No lol but you called it garbage! Theyre at worst, totally comparable Is this just based on the idea that Steph has a better team? I dont understand the argument Chad these are very comparable lol Yes they are comparable Lol but steph got the nod on 1st team and way more mvp votes Sorry in advance if Im acting like the new guy at your work Oh yeah thats just Stephs name Obviously, hes on the warriors Neymar Messi suarez and griezman on Barca. Holy hell Thats absurd Is that confirmed? Griezman yes Neymar said hes reached a verbal agreement with Barca but now has to talk to psg about a buyout Interesting Gonna be NUTS Happy birthday, Mr. Yim! Ohhh Jimmmay! Happy birthday dude. I hope you see this. Haha thanks dudes What was laymens qualifying offer? 1.9 million Way less than he will get Whats the market for him? I kinda like layman Id keep him for 4/5 Am I way off here or is 1.9MM kinda insulting? I feel like hes way better than that? Thats just what his rookie contract deems a QO He was a second round pick gotcha Ok so portland isnt really lowballing him? Thats just the standard procedure? Yes its baked into the contract from the moment he signed Russillo the goat just made the funniest analogy about forgetting Sarah Marshall and the AD trade 

AD is Sarah Marshall
Lakers are Russell Brand 
Pelicans are Jason Segal 
Zion is Mila Kunis Pelicans just got dumped by the star for Hollywood and then Zion aka mila kunis falls in there lap lol He also said he heard the blazers organization is buzzing about Simons this summer. Which probably means Neil is trying to shine another nickel to make a ridiculous trade offer Fucking great film and even better analogy Wait what ridiculous trade offer Anfernee is old enough to vote now so he gonna ball out Like Anfernee and Collins for Ad type offer That way he can have Woj say we were in the mix Lol wut https://twitter.com/thesteinline/status/1143607262050705408?s=21 **drama** https://twitter.com/dwightjaynes/status/1143599916897296384?s=21 If Baze kills all of the Simons hope by taking his number he's gonna be more hated than Felton What the actual fuck? Penny 2.0 baby Honestly Im copping a No. 1 Simons jersey I mean 1 for Simons is kinda tight Anybody watching that Lowe woj report Thats interesting. They would be doing a LA type of thing. They wouldnt have anybody on that roster left https://twitter.com/justrycole/status/1143552610168819712?s=21 This Iggy breakfast club stuff is crazy Absolutely insane they called a fracture a bone bruise ? Anything is possible Is this making news cycle yet ? Tomorrow morning I would bet By 8 am EST espn has the whole day mapped out Is his contact up? Contract * Why is he being so candid Yeah good question Selling a book Does the book talk about all this? Probably not??? But idk maybe! Im not buying it Im not buying it either! Also Im not buying the book either! I forgot to tell you guys I got big timed by Derrick white today. I'm running a left hand layup station for these 6-10 year olds, and Derrick walks up and is like "nah man these kids can't make a left hand layup do it from the right side." And made all the kids switch sides I'm like oh yep sure definitely. Right hand it is Damn lol damn chad I respect the hell out of that. My 12 year olds cant even do lefty layups Haha I'm not gonna front they were terrible. But the dude that's actually running the camp told me to do it cuz I double checked He's like "challenge em!" What. I wish someone had made me do leftys ? Salem Oregon youth system taught me the left hand The sauce is about the fundamentals Hows the sauces reputation for cardio Matty kid is like literally the peak cardio of the sauce Indeed I once was described by my coach to the statesman journal as a horse KD declines player option? Is this news? I think he was always going to? I think he has to in order to sign a Max deal Broken KD to the Knicks would be great Im out on KD to the Knicks. I dont think its happening anymore. https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1143960727948058626?s=21 Lakers should just accept their fate they ain't getting a Max guy, and just take Capela and Eric Gordon for free Well that would be a major win for them right? I think so. But it sounds like if they fork over a first round pick it's a done deal Sweet sounds like a 2031 first rounder should get it done You can get lakers dont win championship -180 Interesting. Lowe pod givoney says his favorite pick was Nassir little Unfortunately for Ian Sean marks says his fav is herro Anyway we can get pj tucker? We don't have cap space to absorb him. Maybe if we got a third team to take on harkless, and we gave them a pick and we get tucker https://twitter.com/chrisbhaynes/status/1144000294394552320?s=21 One contender and 2 scrubs See what Kanter said about ZION? Link me For sure just show it rather than ask if we seent it Julius Randle with hops I feel like that was a compliment to Randle Yeah how does Julius take that? He seems like a glass half empty kinda guy Oh he responded. Yo @Eneskanter last time you guarded me I had 45 relax bro lol K Love is in Portland Oh shit https://twitter.com/blazersfr/status/1144013148963217414?s=21 ?It happened today boys Im high right now but I just wanted to say I love yall Wow whole new world of sports writing wife content at your fingertips Holy shit that is beautiful Congrats dude I can now pivot to Wife Guy if all else fails Congrats Gundy! ?Sorry mark. Your reign is no more. Congrats gundy!!! I love that Gundy squeezed his wedding in between the draft and free agency. A true nba man. Dont let her fall down a slope Premium free agent signs long term deal My mom literally said my suit was like a draft pick Then she said I was showing off my 2% Nigerian side Problematic Moms! lmao Congrats Gunde!!! Hell yeah Gundy congrats my man! Looked amazing! ? LeBron is giving up #23. What a fucking genius. Klutch Sports is saving the Lakers Narrative: LeBron is a great teammate. Hes giving AD the number hes always worn. Reality: LeBron about to sell twice as many laker jerseys. He also low key wants to flex on Kobe lol Kobe Stans: Kobe wore two numbers for the Lakers better than LeBron ever could. Kobe's stats in both jerseys is kinda epic tho Almost identical. Could be HOF in their own I'm kinda surprised Kawhi is actually meeting with the Lakers Does lebron really wanna be a 3rd wheel? https://twitter.com/cbssportsnba/status/1144321026102374403?s=21 Alright guys camp wrapped today. We had 2 awards: team championship, and then team olympics where each team had to complete a series of drills/shots and then the team coach had to shoot a half court shot underhand to finish it. 

Your boy won 1st place in both. So I think I was the best coach of the camp I think that qualifies you to coach the Phoenix Suns. I think Kawhi knows he needs to do load management hella so he wants a stable team AD made the Lakers more stable so it makes sense to me https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/c64onp/200_iq_vegan_protesters_lock_themselves_to_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app Dylan just imaging if someone bike locked themselves to one of your hazelnut trees lol I would shoot them in the head Haha I understand youre in peace but youre fucking up everything here
 Love the response from the worker I can confirm the chocolate hazelnuts are ?? ? New Freddie Gibbs/MadLib album so you know its gonna be a good day https://twitter.com/l_hurd/status/1144431516962787329?s=12 alright we roll the balls out and let the kids hoop, who wins: Coach Chad or Coach Lamar? I got Coach Chad So does Vegas Are Denver kids more disciplined than Portland kids is the question Jesus. Simmons now trying to act like Kemba is better than Dame or Kyrie. He can be so annoying lol. Now that Kemba May be a Celtic. Yeah he needs to calm his tits on all that He just does these obvious things sometimes with the Celtics It just pissed me off because he threw Dames name in it What a loser Dont even fucking think about muttering negativity towards Dame Simmons you fucking twat! Simmons went way downhill for me when he started gargling KD's balls Just watch the video where he talks about how the Celtics were going to win like 67 games last year to feel better Celts had the best roster in the east Just didnt pan out Yeah who saw them being relatively trash coming? Arguably Maybe Tatum isn't as good as people thought and Hayward ain't the same player In that vain do we see Nurk coming back as good as ever or do we have a Hayword-esque season from him ahead of us? I have a feeling it is going to be the latter Since Nurk relies more on size and brute force over perimeter mobility and explosiveness.. I'm optimistic Yeah this is fair Guess it is a more comparable scenario to Boogie Simmons was wilding with the Kemba stuff like chill man Hes the best player on the 10th seed Firstly, Simmons doesnt gargle KD really anymore, he seems to have burned that bridge. Second, the Celts really seems like it was about pushing to give Heyward minutes, Kyrie wanting the ball and overshadowing Tatum/Brown, and the fact that Tatum just didnt progress for whatever reason I think Nurks injury is most like the Paul George one Yeah Hayward's was at the ankle George and Nurk had the same shin break Dr Houman weigh in GUYS Russillo just said a guy who is always right said Simons has a chance to be insanely special Theyre saying if they make a trade they could be a title contender Is Neil smarter than we all thought Neil definitely talks to Russillo But I believe him The blazers really do believe in Simons like that Of course they do But is that believed by others is the question Neil is definitely getting that idea out there tho Via Russillo Love it Idk if its Neil that Russillo is mentioning tho I dont think hed say it if it was Neil just because obviously Neil feels that way Exactly Sounds like he's mentioning someone else. A scout or executive Summer league is gonna be Simons time Yeah Im stoked. Theyre basically saying we have a bunch of assets and who knows who is available I just want Love or Blake. That's all I really hope kawhi stays east or this wide open west is gonna close quickly ???????? Airport TSA machine detected large object in my pants. Nothing was in my pockets. Looks like Jimmy isnt the only one in this group with large balls ?? ?????????? https://youtu.be/hqyhojksn4U Take it as a compliment, Matt! I get stopped and groped about 50% of the time. Youll get used to it ? Kinda wild https://theundefeated.com/features/darren-collison-i-have-decided-to-retire-from-the-nba/ Not gunna lie but there isnt a music genre that I dislike more than country But at the same time rap lately (past 2-3yrs) is also absolutely terrible. Sorry I dont care about lil lip/pump/Gucci/Habibi and his struggles through life on his songs. All I care about are beats I just want beats/rhythm. I apologize for the rant but can you disagree Check out Old Town Road - May change your opinion on both genres Lmao Houman youre a fucking L7 weenie I agree thats an exception. Im thinking big picture here Im generalizing. And I know its wrong but just run with it Also pretty cross faded rn so that could be a determining factor Before lil Nas x there was kid rock So what youre saying is between 2006 and 2019 we had a 13 yr gap where it sucked Houmans 3 AM Agenda Welcome to my brain Houmie just wants some Bad Bunny on the speakers https://twitter.com/rysimmons/status/1144283018825277440?s=12 I saw this but I wont spoil for those who havent l
AP Lmaooo Its amazing Wtf Space prolly made it Wtf did I just watch haha Idk but Ive got a footlong everyday since watching Haven't started the commercial yet but my guess is hankook tires https://twitter.com/shamscharania/status/1145037017153200129?s=21 ?? Thats nuts The fuck! Any chance he doesnt actually do it Leverage plays Play? He did get traded at the deadline each of the last two years Maybe he was just sick of it ? ? I wonder if we'd target a We$ return if a market for him doesn't materialize I could see him landing somewhere on a vet minimum deal He hates Neil tho I dont doubt we would want him But that relationship ended really badly He can start for the warriors next year if he wants And hes friends with Steph Houmie r u in NY ? Yes sir Lol k I made significant eye contact with someone I thought was u glad I didn't say anything I am not in NY https://twitter.com/jonesonthenba/status/1145044849529245696?s=12 Wow wheres Ians boner Jimmy butler meeting with mini Miami* Big Dick Pat Riley Oh shit! I wonder what scary terry nets on the open market Does some team sign him as a starter? Phoenix? Indiana? Chad give us a mil/year On terry? Yah 4 year / 50 mil Yikes Marcus smart got 4/52 Terry's better than him Sure but he better in a way that hes less better in his skill set of that makes any sense Like hes better if I could only have one but Marcus is a bigger percentage in guys like himself No I feel you 100% Like as a starting pg terry is in the bottom third. Smart gives you elite defense off the bench which is crucial Exactly Chad will never stop going in chronicles part 12 ? That girl is a giant Yeah shes sports illustrated Hes ready to come home Everyone said that. I googled it and she's 5'10 Not that tall unless you're Houman Yea thats too tall. 55 and below please ? Houman if you aren't aware that's dame in the bottom right I thought it was Steve austin Our nurkic deal is looking so good right now Getting him for 12 a year is crazy Yeah that was a fucking steal Myles turner makes like 19. Nurk is way better Meyers makes 11 lol Haha finally a contract goes our way If we pay Aminu over 10 a year... Yeah 10 seems right. I'm afraid we let him walk Id rather let him walk than overpay ?Wut is this fit by McHale lol Wannabe Bill Walton Wow lots of open posits at mlb internal content teams rn

Online ordering taking too long need it by the 4th Prob like a dicks sporting goods no?

Matt work some magic here Some are saying Josh May need to go to make room for jimmy I mean if its a sign and trade Theyre gonna need to part with somebody right? Yes Damn Im all about this But I love those guys Josh is honestly perfect for the sixers Yeah hes definitely the most promising dude on the heats roster The South Beach Boys Great for dame but does he realize thats going to hamper what the team can do to build in future, I honestly thought he might be fine taking less Not saying I would in his shoes but he talks about wanting to win most and this will hurt that If I was dame Id do the same. Hes not a big player endorsement wise like lebron. His brand isnt a significant money maker when he leaves the nba. Take the money youre owed and the team will have to figure it out. Ethier way we always build through the draft as is so we just have to hit on a guy at the right time ? Love that no one is wasting time this year announcing! I think KD will stay warriors My prediction is Knicks What do you think kawai does? Clips? I want all these players to go east lol Kanter talking to the blazers tonight! I think Kawhi stays KD to Brooklyn Wow Wow Marc stein saying Deandre Jordan also Holy shit Wowww Lol Knicks Ticket prices are about to sky rocket Snag your season ticks now hoomie Nets Mets Jets all winning titles book it If Kwaki stays nets won win this year KDs timetable is unknown and the nets are in no need to rush it when they have both their stars for 4 years. Id say Boston has a better shot with Kemba this year than the nets Kwawki ?????????? 2021 nets are title favorites tho Lol @knicks Great job trading porzingis! Can someone get the new chapter meme rolling ASAP Kawhi officially a B I T C H Whoa https://twitter.com/nbaontnt/status/1145440813498982401?s=12 ? Yeah I said that hoomie When I said the whole bitch thing I thought that was this dyslan Dylan* https://mobile.twitter.com/AlexKennedyNBA/status/1063322303788974080 I didnt read your message fully lol Lol KD is also a bitch we knew that already though Man thats a lot of money for Harrison Barnes Damn if its kawai, Lebron and AD lol Phili is about to be weak next year now, Reddick to NO Butler most likely gone Horford to philly The Chief to Disney World Bye bye Aminu ? Will blazers have room for max spot next summer once bazermore, Leonard and harkless contracts are done? Might as well done an auto fantasy draft on 2k and call it good Ricky Rubio just got paid again lol How did we not match that offer smh Cause Neil cant lose his job Damn jazz going to be solid Chad how you doing out there? Jazz are top 4 contenders in the west rn Rodney Hoooood They already were Houman Hood and Baze is kinda dope Lets go! Ill take hood over aminu Bring me kanter too HELLL YES At least we got Hood back. We need scorers more than whatever Aminu does Get kanter back and another solid vet minimum guy and I'll be happy Yup! A starting 4 would be good too Until we get LOVE Hood deal is player option year 2 so sounds like another 1 year prove it deal I didnt think we had money for that tho? Yeah idk how we afforded that Do we still want love? Hell prolly be washed once we get him Well we need someone to start at the 4! Love scares me with his contract and health Love isnt worth it ? Knicks got Julius randle theyre good Zion with no hops. Not bad ? He better not be teasing! Ohhhhh fuck Im not banking on anything exciting Robin Lopez is best case scenario imo I would rather pay RoLo than Kanter Congrats Ian https://twitter.com/shamscharania/status/1145498819712421888?s=21 Wow. Ah man I was hoping it would be dragic https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1145499428398215168?s=21 Wait what??? How did they have cap space for that Sixers are favorites in the east now They arent paying jimmy They were way over the cap tho You don't just subtract jimmy and have all his space Leonard going to lakers or raps Hes not gunna go to the clips . Hes not gunna go there when theres no other superstar and he has to play 46 min a game Yes Yeah its lakers or raptors for sure now that jimmy is off the board My Bucks arent getting better while the rest of the east is Dragic & Luka reunited and it feels so good If Carlisle ever retires they gotta hire Igor Would you rather have the odds of your top 3 teams to win the title or the field? Gotta wait to see where Kawhi goes first If he goes lakers I take top 3 If not I take the field Yah https://twitter.com/jwquick/status/1145464545713897473?s=21 Taxpayer mid level** but that makes sense. Good get Yeah hes worth every penny. Good value. Bazemore + Hood + Little > ET + Hood + Aminu https://twitter.com/dwightjaynes/status/1145502530073288704?s=21 Watch us get Javale or something lmao ?So this is the current squad. Kanter and Curry are probably goners. We need some solid vet min pickups in those spots. Then trade for Love Whos still out there that we could sign for the vet min? https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1145511788265517056?s=21 I dont understand this You have JA on a rookie deal, why pay $10M for essentially the same player? Wes Mathews, Ed Davis, Javale Magee, Gortat, Richaun Holmes, RHJ, Justin Holiday could all be interesting Yeah I don't get that at all Dubov. Especially at 4 years. Maybe 2 But JA is the truth What team is Wes Mathews on?? Pacers? Corey Joseph or Wayne Ellington could be targets Ed Davis to Utah Booooooo FUCK He should have retired a blazer Fuck you neil And taj to the knicks?? For 10 million lol Thought so Dubov but the above message made it seem like he went to nets for some reason The Knicks are so fucking inept. Apparently Dolan wasnt willing to give KD the max? So instead he spent that money on Randle & Taj? I also love how Kyrie and KD were so bitchy with the media this season for "jumping to conclusions" about them wanting to play together cuz they kept having dinner, and were seen talking at the all star break etc... then that's exactly what they did -- joined forces It's almost like the media was doing their jobs Dragic not back with Luka https://twitter.com/shamscharania/status/1145518364326072322?s=21 Noooooooooo Brooklyn Bitches Sounds like a WNBA team Im just excited I have a team to hate more than the warriors finally https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1145519015818911744?s=21 Reminds me of the time I couldn't figure out if I should break up with my gf or not I think I asked her the same thing Jesus the bucks have lost their minds https://twitter.com/shamscharania/status/1145519113093206016?s=21 In a fantasy world would you guys trade Nurk for BroLo? David griffin is fuckin acing this rebuild Lonzo / Elfrid Payton
Jrue / Reddick
Ingram / Josh Hart
Zion / Derrick Favors
Hayes / Dialo

That's a hell of a pivot off AD https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1145523960177713152?s=21 Mario party !!! Layman probably gone then Hezonja!!! Its a me, Mario Hes decent yeah? Especially for the min lol we have Mario Hezonja a player option? *gave Yeah were title contenders now for sure Lol Still need backup pg and center Still waiting for that starting 4 Imagine if we got Curry back Still waiting to not have moe harkless play more than 8 min a game ? Imagine if nurk plays this year ? ?Imagine if we weren't paying 5 mil a year for players to NOT play for us Olshey GM of the decade Who's the winner of the day besides Brooklyn? Is it Utah? I think it has to be Utah or New Orleans So does this mean kanter is gone? NOLA We can only give Kanter the minimum. He's gonna get offered more If he gets a lot of money yes Hezonja top 5 pick in 2015 - by Orlando - Olshey about to work his magic again Olshey basically chose Hood over Kanter. We could have offered either the TPMLE Can't say I disagree with him Give me shooters for terry Can we give kanter a back loaded contract? Center is a mercenary position Like once Myers is done he gets more money in the last couple of years No need to pay 3 Kanter will find his way back for playoffs Yea but Myers is gone. And could be a trading piece for us Meyers is just beginning Bro heat to the finals Dragic herro jimmy justice bam Meyer is dead to me We need that layman news Myers needs to go become an IG model and quit basketball Meyers is our starting center watch your tongue Is meyers and Zach going to be our only big men to start the year? Ill slit my tongue off if he is And send it to you Right now Meyers is our starter lol CONTRACT YEAR Neil should give him the extension now Mavs could be the third team in a Kevin Love deal Lets do another 4 for 40 https://twitter.com/townbrad/status/1145527765799788544?s=21 Yeah our team looks poised to be giving up harkless or something, we got a log jam at forwards And klove is in Portland as we speak! Harkless on the Mavs makes sense Russel to GSW, gtfo Honestly Go for it Warriors! Have fun! I just dont want him to go to Minnesota Kawhi went dark GSW has to trade Iguodala or Draymond now too If they make that Russell deal Iggy goes to Brooklyn if that happens? Draymond to pdx Oh boy Ian the Miami deal might be falling through Jimmy back to clips https://twitter.com/thesteinline/status/1145532434865426433?s=21 Lol No I think just iggy to another team Dont think it has to be to GSW Give me some Draymond https://twitter.com/shamscharania/status/1145533354730766338?s=21 Mario aint scared of nobody https://twitter.com/mariohezonja/status/1145531975425376256?s=12 So does GSW have to trade one of them? Or could they go with all of them ? The warriors are retarded that doesnt even make sense? So they have russell, curry and klay? Wait What This is genius! Warriors front office deserves a round of applause Lol I wanted to see russell go to PHX He still might Yea wait when can they trade him? Warriors arent gunna keep him. Hes gunna be traded. But for losing KD they just got a trade exception +dlo Like wow And the bonus is they actually need him for the first half of the season so not the worst thing in the world if they cant find the right piece Dlo just got fucked here because now he doesnt have a say in where he goes lol I think the heat just have to find somewhere to dump Dragic What it sounds lik Like Iggy to Memphis This is so weird https://twitter.com/chrisbhaynes/status/1145538410259501058?s=21 Did the Warriors tell Iggy fuck you by sending him to Memphis? Lol I feel like iggy is about to say fuck it and ride the bench to retire Bro the nba is insane rn This is as crazy as we could have possible envisioned Brian Fernandez is the best player in MLS do not @ me Not until December 15 Stephen Who? https://twitter.com/nbaontnt/status/1145542510300848128?s=12 Knicks got Bobby portis at least The DLo trade has Nate Duncan big man and Im here for it https://twitter.com/nateduncannba/status/1145544623495897088?s=21 I can't believe the warriors pulled that off Fuck them But no way they can keep Draymond next year right? I think this could backfire though I guess hes a solid trade piece now Speaking of backfires, this Jimmy Miami thing is in serious trouble The Mavericks were apparently confused about who they were getting And that part of the deal is now off Miami and Philly are scrambling to find a 3rd team with cap space to make it work Wow . How is space taking it ? Idk hes probably asleep and is going to wake up to this Poor guy Beverly got the contract he wanted Looks like if Dragic does leave (pending this butler situation) it might be lakers if Leonard doesnt sign right Oh shit didnt realize hes still on contract Dragic to Lakers May be their best plan B now If they miss on Kawhi Dragic would be a sick backup for Caruso imo ? If we were to lose kanter I wouldnt mind nene if we could get him for cheap I kinda want Javale. Call me crazy Also why did the Knicks spend all their cap space on 3 power forwards https://twitter.com/shamscharania/status/1145570779356119040?s=21 wow the rich get richer https://www.instagram.com/tv/BzWmyMaho_-/?igshid=1vrgsz34irmlx That is a broken man I saw an interesting theory. Timberwolves and D-Lo still want each other, and Russell ain't gonna fit in GS long term but they needed an asset back. Wolves couldn't find trade partners to take back contracts to clear space to sign D-Lo, and D-Lo wasn't gonna wait around and watch the money dry up. 

So golden state gets Russell then waits 6 months til he's trade eligible and trades him to Minnesota for RoCo, Teague and a first. Balances out their roster more and Russell joins his boy Towns What do you say? I dont think its anywhere near that but Ill still be disappointed https://twitter.com/willguillory/status/1145698584014262276?s=12 Yeah I agree only bc the lakers arent coming the best record in history More like the heat situation Which still pissed everybody off ?? I was only mad cuz I for sure thought hed go to the knicks lol I dont think its even remotely the same thing Kawhi is from Southern California and its been a long running narrative that he wanted to go home. And the Lakers are one of the two most prestigious franchises in the league that traditionally everybody wants to play for Plus more ppl were just mad about the a Decision - no ones gonna be up in arms when kawhi breaks the news on 4chan https://twitter.com/celebrityhottub/status/1145415230299758599?s=21 ^ I laughed harder at this than I should have I did like that one the best too mark lol Someday someone will transition into coaching and do a Gary vee style video with LinkedIn It will be Chad With endorsements from Derrick White and Max from Salesforce- Chad is moving up the road to Colorado Springs to coach the best and brightest players this country has to offer https://twitter.com/dragonflyjonez/status/1145720816367210496?s=21 https://www.instagram.com/p/BzWdsn3hP59/?igshid=1wvnfztu4viy8 Gonna miss chief but I won't miss that catapult wind up from 3 Zach is gonna start at the 4 Until we trade for Kevin I can't believe that contract Corey Joseph just got. And Reggie Bullock got more than Julius Randle last season lol I'm still hoping for Javale, RoLo or Richaun Holmes at center, and a vet PG for the min to replace Curry Then trigger the Love trade RoLo is off the board Rolo is on the bucks Oh fuck good call Gimme the one of the other 2 then Lets see if Kanter comes back for the minimum I would do that Well, yeah. But what are the chances that happens? Love isnt worth that salary. We can win without him. Plus he would cause us to not be able to give CJ max money with his extension I would do Kanter more than JaVale The market is pretty dry now idk I guess the Lakers could pay him if they miss on Kawhi yea that could work. But they really need a 1,2,3 more than a 4 on that squad Which squad? Ours or cleveland? Kanter has to at least get 5 mil from someone I would take him in a heartbeat but agree with Dubov Houman now is the time to go big Cause we do need a 4 We need a stud 4. Loves contract isn't even that bad Right now Collins and Harkless are our 4s and neither really are 4s Dame will be making 50 when Love is making 30 His contract also declines in the last year Wonder if Kanter missed his window Or Boston signs him Kanter will be fine. All of the exceptions are bigger than the vet min we can offer https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1145729586019389442?s=21 Boom. Need a backup guard now Whos out there still? Damn we lost Seth Im gonna be honest, I kinda like this Dallas team even without dragic deal 4/32 for Seth Wow good for him Yeah good for Seth. That's a killer deal coming off 2 mil last year Yeah he deserves it Woah! Wwjhhaatt Wow We took Hassan from space lmao Suck it space hahahahaga Enjoy Meyers ?????????????????????? Haha wow I LOVE NEIL What the fuck That's not Kevin love This does and doesnt bum me out I really believe Hassan can put up big numbers again I'm so confused rn But if this sheds the salary we need For jimmy Please talk us into this space I like that were making a run with dragic Dude when spo gave whiteside minutes he played well At least Neil is doing stuff? I'll give him that Hes still a monster on d Dame
CJ
Bazemore
Zach
Whiteside Yeah and like if you werent getting love... this is a pretty baller consolation prize Now we got a pick and roll action with dame and nurik. If theres nothing off the screen dame can dish to Cj/hood in the corners or do a alley oop to Whiteside This is the best scenario. Ohh and we got Collins as a backup. Plus Myers will never play again for us. CHAMPIONSHIP HERE WE COME Yeah I dunno I feel like this is a great haul Also its one year https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1145734254241964038?s=21 Woj: full time news breaker, part time blazers PR staffer OHHHHHH FUCK LETS GO BOYS! I dunno I think Portland wins big here Yeah I mean Moe and Meyers we're gone next summer. Whiteside can be as well. So pretty low risk move. 

I'm just bummed cuz Meyers and Moe were the Love trade pieces And we get to still talk about Meyers Whiteside has a lot left in the tank Spo just hates him You're talking me into this Space!! Neil olshey, GM of the year I mean the fact that Meyers is gone is a win. If he was our starting center game 1 I would have jumped off a bridge Though enjoy watching him get two consecutive garbage fouls topped off with a technical bc hes mad he got blocked https://twitter.com/chrisbhaynes/status/1145735015277330433?s=21 I mean I dunno, other than Kevin love, what more could have you asked for? I'm loving the media member love lol. Haynes is on the payroll too tho Fair point space. He was the only guy Especially considering how hard they were trying to give him max money two years ago Hassan simultaneously has a high ceiling and a low floor its pretty incredible I feel like theres no low floor though? Like I said its one year Even in limited mins last year 23 per game Whiteside averaged 12 and 11 Hes gunna play his heart out because he knows hes in a contract year ?Updated depth chart. We need more shooting Plus youll get to watch John canzano shit his pants once a month or so Expect Neil to sign 3 19 year olds to drag down our average age so he can preach potential "Look were the youngest team in the league okay" I feel like this means kanter is out WOOOAAAHHG Kanter been out dawg. We don't got money Neil is showing some balls tho. Just let go 2 starters from a 50-win 3 seed. He's always been a sit on your laurels guy Maybe Dame worked Neil not being a bitch into his supertax? supermax Did you guys see the pic of Neil with dames family in Oakland lmao I think the blazers might be favs in the western conference ? Hahahah shut up space Can we get PJ tucker to fill the 4? Id still say were equal with jazz rockets nugg... pending lakers still tho I dunno why not? Lakers? The witch is dead bro Jazz and Nuggets will be legit Blazers have as good a shot as anyone Lakers if they get kawhi it's a wrap Well yeah I mean it's wide open at the moment I agree there Lakers still need to fill the bench. If Memphis buys out iggy and he goes there then Ill agree At the end of the day you know they will be able to fill out that bench. They just need smart vets. And Kyle Korver Lol Mark how stoked are you for Whiteside? I feel like this is a move mark loves Holy shit Naomi Osaka lost in the first round wow Dude I love it Crazy people are great And hes good at D Are the blazers a defensive team now? https://twitter.com/cocooconnell/status/1145737350506356737?s=21 Also oh man Fuck Meyers Leonard The subject of my ire for 5+ years I would be so pissed if Meyers was in the record books for most games played in Portland. Can't believe he lasted 7 years here https://twitter.com/cjmccollum/status/1145736807784550401?s=21 People in the comments acting like losing the 9th guy off the bench for a starting center is a bad thing ML Brand Boutique on Ocean Drive is gonna be a vibe Whiteside??? Also, look at how Denver was saying Nurk was a bad fit and bad chemistry Gundy what you think dawg?? He came in and turned everything around That said, Whiteside is a crazy person But Oregon has loose gun laws We need another rangy wing off the bench So hell be fine Nassir little! Rookie of the year Stotts got the most out of Nurk, Hood, Kanter, Aminu I got faith Dame gonna bust Whitesides ass if he doesnt fall in line We literally just overhauled half our roster This also means nurkic is not coming back Not this year anyway I wouldnt expect to see Nurk before March I'm fine with that. Take it slow big fella Let's bring Vonleh back We matchup well with Philly and Milwaukee with both tho And Utah https://twitter.com/thehoopcentral/status/1145735580317126656?s=21 More of this content Everyone including Nurk lol ?Looks like KD already gave Kyrie the keys to his IG account I would never hand my brand over to Kyrie my god Just a couple of truth seekers on a quest for enlightenment in DUMBO How many weeks into the season until Jimmy murders Meyers? 2 ? Lol https://twitter.com/thekidet/status/1145743913929625601?s=21 Man turner is bitter lol So we keep dragic now? Got ourselves a contender in south fla baby! Jimmy and Meyers are gonna bond over loving country music Jesus Jimmy gonna be so mean to Meyers Love it Its gonna be the worst teammate bullying Miami has seen since Richie Incognito and Jonathan Martin https://www.instagram.com/p/BzYecNzAIqi/?igshid=xw0jg87mc1zc https://twitter.com/shamscharania/status/1145749263160401923?s=21 Whos doubting Dolan now!? Bring We$ back. Mend the fences Neil The Knicks now have DSJ, Frankie Smokes, Elfrid, RJ, Bullock, Trier, Ellington, Dameyan Dotson, Knox, Brazdeikis, Julius Randle, Bobby Portis, Taj Gibson, Mitchell Robinson Im rock hard https://youtu.be/-vlltSehncc Im rock hard watching this ?Athletic hating on the trade - acting like dame cant keep whiteside in line Lol how can both teams lose a trade like that Oh I thought it said b- Eh Im still of the belief whiteside can ball Lmao just ran into Grayson Gatzke Apparently he works in the building next to me https://twitter.com/shamscharania/status/1145757815719505922?s=21 ?Still need a big man, athletic wing, and pg that can shoot Can we afford any of that Wait you have hezojna as a 4? Lets sign Erick McCollum Hezonja can play 1-4 I think All vet mins Dubov I heard paus name. Can we get him on the vet? There's a lot of players and not a lot of space left We could guarantee a job at OHSU post retirement How about an IT flyer You know whos an UFA... Ray Felton No Anthony Tolliver could be a good emergency big who can shoot Lol Im kidding mark Wheres Ty Lawson at JJ Barea or Jose Calderon? Barea just signed a 1 yr with Dallas Dam.n Fuck it - Neil can turn Kaminsky into most improved player of year JBay? Barea also has a torn Achilles Ah I didnt know that What about the DRAGAN? ???? ??More free agents Kosta Kofous?! Richuan Holmes would be good. What about Faried? I like Holmes a lot Kofous was CJ's high school teammate Shelvin Mack is nice Tyus Jones would be perfect but Minnesota gonna pay him https://twitter.com/marcjspearsespn/status/1145767567434440705?s=21 Okay what the fuck Neil Also if Iggy gets bought out by Memphis, maybe he comes here? We're a contender now! I dont think we do the whiteside deal if he signs do not that big of a deal I feel like they wanted to do the whiteside deal so they pressured him Ethier way it would have been a win Whiteside better than Kanter its not close https://twitter.com/shamscharania/status/1145774453223231489?s=21 Holmes is gone. Cauley-Stine may be available now I would've wanted Kanter and whiteside We also could still trade Whiteside later this season for Love or someone else https://twitter.com/blazersbysagar/status/1145776732110118913?s=21 Gundy this dude is so dramatic lol OMG WE GOT RID OF MEYERS ? What idiots! HAHAHA I'm all in on Iggy. Dame and CJ needa get on the phone Zach Lowe just said Whiteside could hold down the fort til February when Nurk comes back. Then we flip Whiteside for Love Love how this years FA is also seemingly setting up for a big trade deadline as well. You dont think they could do better than an expiring contract for love? If they were so content on shipping him out, why not now? Nah everything I've read is expirings and picks is all it'll take for Love Gilbert is stubborn and still holding out hope for ticket sales etc. belief is maybe he comes back to reality by the trade deadline Whiteside, Little and 1 or 2 firsts to get off Loves deal seems like a win win for both sides ?Smh Damn Gunde with the complete chat title reversal https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1145786801044500480?s=21 Shit Wes got the minimum. Too bad Neil burned that bridge Hes also from there Durant getting his number retired is a joke https://www.instagram.com/p/BzYxqTSlRa5/?igshid=1lqctb4f9wywc Correct Enes Kanter is just a guy being a dude LeBrons friend has gone too far lmao ? Kawhi is not doing it for Nipsey lmao Yeah jeez lol https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1145801303920173062?s=12 Harkless is going to clippers so that may be Portlands involvement tho I think it worked out for us We didnt give up any picks and got the 2nd best player in the deal Clippers got harkless, no need for Kawhi now It cost a first to absorb one year of harkless. And we didn't have to give it up. Win for us Anyway we hold off on a deal for love and throw all the money at draymond next year? What money lol Arent we gonna have a lot of cap space next summer when hes a FA? It's doable. We'd have to gut the team but could fill it with minimums I guess If we just kept 

Dame
CJ
Nurkic
Zach
Simons 
Little We could sign draymond to the max Draymond doesnt deserve max money. Everyone knows that. Any team that pays him that will be screwed for the next 4yrs Minnesota picking up the scraps from the Brooklyn Warriors trade Draymond is a product of the system. Put him on the Hawks and he wont be effective. Those assist numbers are purely a result of having the two/three best shooters in the game. Yes he knows how to find people but still, his stats are inflated You could also argue his stats may be better on a team like the hawks but I get your point Fair but he's also one of the best defenders in the league. That's not a system I agree with that But he doesnt deserve 34+ a year. Id put him at the 22-27 mil range His a huge liability of offense and we saw that when Klay was KD was out I think he's at least worth what al horford just got 4/109. ~27 mil Okay I can agree on that And ya I wasnt necessarily suggesting max but whatever gets it done Draymond would be legit with dame Cj and healthy Nurk https://twitter.com/dame_lillard/status/1145811344651771906?s=21 Also iggy to LAL appears to be finalized ?? Dammit Has anybody heard from the Thunder? Sam Presti hasn't done shit yet except sign Mike Muscala ^ what else do you need Report that KD felt like the second fiddle to curry on the warriors. Cmon did you really expect to feel like the guy on a team that was already amazing before you came lol. Steph had won mvp I believe the year before The report said that might have been one of the reasons he left lol KD is so insecure lol https://twitter.com/chrisbhaynes/status/1145816889211277312?s=21 Woulda been perfect at the backup 4 Wonder what he secured 2/10 maybe?

Yes, until the Jussie Smollet Duck boot is released Man were in the middle of World Cup, Wimbledon, and a huge womens launch next week and I gotta waste my time dealing with the insane amount of incoming hate from all the 50 year old inbred MAGA dipshits who have never spent more than $100 lifetime with Nike. All because we *didnt* release a product they never wouldve purchased in the first place Exactly -all the ppl crying wouldve had no idea the shoe was ever released.

No surprise. They must have taken those photos at the Antifa rally on Sunday Listen up snowflakes Nike looks weak af. Even liberals dont think that flag is offensive. Where does it end? Tucker Carlson signing off now Instagram fucked up Yea its all fucked up today I think Kap is the only one who finds it offensive Never needed to be an issue - first mention of it I saw was on Monday on Fox News then it took off. People who are enraged about it look foolish and are showing their true colors tho Yah kaep looks dumb Betsy was a Quaker Lets just focus on how laker fans are gonna go off on woj when he announces kawhi to clips Kawhi to Nets??!?!? https://twitter.com/trailblazers/status/1146459838429454337?s=21 Got a quarter chub right now Is anybody following this kawhi OJ chase right now I love free agency Side note - the comments on ojs tweets are the best thing on twitter right now Hell be better than stauskas He wants to play ETs role as point forward which is good Heat gonna get cousins Be the baddest team in the league Oh thatd be dope And make sense Why not kawhi also Jimmy / Boogie / Herro Thats second round of the playoffs right there Yah thats a great fit Especially if they make him run some lines Slim boogie https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1146514603767152641?s=21 Lmao another suns top 5 draft pick bust Eww Grizzlies loading up https://twitter.com/oddsshark/status/1146493383445102592?s=12 James Jones says get out! No Doris? Give me kyler Korver in red and black. Thats a shooter we need Looks like he's headed to lakers sixers or bucks Shit RIP The Hefty lefty Jared lorenzen I know but I want them! What was the point of that trade for Phoenix? Melton and Jackson are the best players in the trade Both them and 2 picks for Jevon Carter? Jackson is a toxic asset to them apparently I mean they do have 7 SF's but still Please god Jalen be right The fact that they took Jackson over pairing De'Aaron Fox with Booker still blows my mind https://twitter.com/danwolken/status/1146517061063118848?s=21 I think that the fact that he went back to Toronto today for a meeting says a lot He going lakers Raptors, he knows east is easier for him Maybe he just wanted to break up with them face to face Hell probably just do a 1+1 And LA next year Nobody breaks up face to face anymore Lol kawhi doesnt care that much Theyre not letting him out of Canada. Locking him in deandre jordan style 1+1 would be smart cuz then he can opt out for the 10 year max scale He did tell pop to fuck off to his face Kyle Korver tho would be clutch for blazers....hed be wide open shooting 3s all day! Dame needs to recruit better Yeah he shouldve been out recruiting vs family bbqing https://twitter.com/jwquick/status/1146480799757156352?s=21 Korver disappears in the playoffs tho And hes gonna be 38 this year Or 39 I think Yah miss me w Korver I think their strat is great Lets get the culture Nothing they really do have over other teams One thing* Leverage* Anyone who isnt working out for non ball reasons is a good target for them. Make Portland the mental health capital of the nba Lol suns have now let a top 5 pick walk cuz he sucked (Alex Len), used an 8th pick (Marquees Chriss) to dump Brandon Knights contract, and used a 4th pick (Josh Jackson) to dump salary to sign Ricky Rubio Truly superb drafting Dragon Bender too Ill never understand Marquis Chriss hype - he was essentially Kenny Wooten in college They also could have traded Bledsoe and the 4th pick (Josh Jackson) to the Cavs for Kyrie but turned them down Kyrie and Booker woulda been dope Does Kawhi really want to play somewhere, where its only 28 degrees in July tho? https://twitter.com/wtevs/status/1146488025851092993?s=12 ?I'm just dunking on you all day Ian https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1146577279306407936?s=21 RIP in peace sweet prince Wonder what blazers get Tyus possible? Maybe? I feel like theyve earmarked backup PG for Simons tho I wouldnt expect more than a protected 2nd rounder Looks like we got nothing? They absorbed into their trade exception??? Gundy some clarification Well we could get draft compensation still I think It just means they didnt have to send salary back to Portland to do the deal Ahhh okay 4 million trade exception then? Im glad that Jake got a good contract Rengel Im not sure on that I wish I knew how creating exceptions worked All the moves Portland made also took his PT Bazemore, Hezonja, Tolliver all would get more minutes Ya Ive never understood what it means I know how you can use it I just dont know how it gets created You should combine forces with Neil gundy Hey guy chad here, 99.9% sure we get a trade exception for that. Should be 4 mil like Rengel said We'll have 12 months to use it. Neil didn't use the Crabbe or Vonleh ones tho https://twitter.com/dwightjaynes/status/1146586156332511232?s=12 Whiteside plus the exception could get Kevin love if we go that route I don't think you can combine the exception with a players contract. But whiteside for Love straight up still works. Just has to be within 125% of each other O ok nice That's how we traded Meyers and moe (22 mil) for whiteside (27 mil) ?Watching the WSOP look at these names lmao Stinky Cheeseman Comeback SZN Cheeseman gets paid Whiteman gets Betsy Ross Nikes https://twitter.com/thecrossover/status/1146611607184773121?s=21 ?Lol I found the new Meyers guys His bio says "I hate me more than you do" Did you say pretty sure that's not true pal? ?This is what triggered him I never understand that argument by him Like I get that argument if he's a comedian or some shit but he's literally a journalist isn't his whole job to debate and have back and forths with people? I guess the argument is writer vs pundit? I dunno ? Bahahahahahaha He Shea Serrano'd you lmao Hahahaha Guy is a loose cannon Dude he's freaking out about jake Layman Guy barely saw the floor Bahahaha.

RIP eastern conference supremacy 2019-2019 Philis conference to lose Yeah I mean I wanted him to stay but this is a great second option I think Milwaukee is still better Love that he went clips vs Lakers. Ruh roh Lebron https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1147383639036092416?s=21 What the fuck!!!! Never mind No parity Clippers to the finals Wtffffff Whattttt Russel Westbrook LOL Yeah damn Clips are def the new favs However! Its not as bad Wow total fuck you to the Lakers As if he went to the Lakers Also kinda dope Thunder throwing in the towel? Russel next? PG and Kawhi are both SoCal natives And are on the Clippers and not the Lakers So much for PG choosing okc last summer lol The real nba team in LA! Man Im curious about this record setting collection of draft choices Woj letting Chris Haynes drop the first bomb, but not the biggest one! Has woj been licking his chops all day waiting to send that tweet? Alright Neil, wake up, get back to work!

Da fuck Damnnn Lakers just throwing money to make sure they get someone ya Haha Russel has to be traded now right?? I think Russ is a lifer. He has a fat contract. Can be the man Will go down as best player in Sonics history God gundy is gonna be so thrown when he wakes up to kawhi Clippers Remember when Jalen said 99% raptors That is a great haul for OKC Depending what years the picks start in Blazers should go for Steven Adams Roberson Would be legit Best nba season ever coming up Omfg Get the fuck out of here. Why dont we just have a god damn fantasy draft every year Good morning!!! Damn Woj just reported presti almost traded Westbrook to Toronto https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1147490007831273472?s=21 It was PG and Russ for Siakam and Masai couldnt do it Lol Russ to the raptors? Hey so is PG and Kawhi on the Clippers now The 8th seed in the west added two stars, shit is gonna be so crazy https://twitter.com/chris_broussard/status/1146779626171068416?s=21 I was confused because I read this Chris Broussard tweet saying clippers out 20 minutes before Kawhi announced going to the clippers Lol half black half sources Russ next Clippers Lakers Christmas Day? Yeah is Russ gonna get traded I'm still so shocked by all this. Everyone said clippers were last place Everyone was wrong I cant believe Kawhi convinced PG to request a trade That to me is the biggest move of all Quietest guy in the NBA just remaking the NBA in silence Lol Doc working with PG is funny given the history w his daughter Shes a married Curry woman now, she traded up tbh Pg is also like The second quietest guy So Two peas in a pod Steve fucking balmer goddamnit lol PG also cheated on her and knocked up a stripper Kawhi and PG is gonna be the most feared perimeter defense since Wade and Bron Great storyline to follow space good call Brock* So how is the western conference ranked now? Better than the East I feel like golden state, Clippers, Lakers, Utah, Blazers, rockets, Nuggets are all lumped together I feel like the rockets and lakers arent gonna be great Like 7, 8 seed territory I wouldnt go that far but blazers will be better And what does Toronto do from here? Do they tear it down? Too bad we couldn't have waited and traded for Gasol instead of Whiteside 1 might actually finish 7th now thinking about it Dylan - but ya I could be right U* Im just saying things dont automatically click and the Lakers dont have a guard also CP3 is done Rockets will make playoffs easy and harden will carry but I see them getting bounced first round Clippers, Jazz, Nuggets and Blzers neck and neck tho IMO Warriors 5th seed maybe if D Lo goes off Time out, what happened with PG and docs daughter? Warriors will be wild card for sure and will w
Hopefully get matched with clippers in first or 2nd Ed https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1147572442593992704?s=21 Where's he going? Dehaan, PG was dating her when he played in Indiana, then he cheated on her with a stripper and got her pregnant. Now she's engaged to Seth Curry LOL no way wow Minnesota? Didnt they want a PG? What do they have to trade tho? Towns and Russel Wiggins and picks? Wiggins is the worst contract in the league lol Wouldnt they have to send something to offset? Toronto is a sneaky Wiggins candidate I agree j wouldnt want him but to make money work No logic behind it but I feel Russ to Orlando I like it Neil just said another trade will be announced today In Rodney Hood presser Unless its just whiteside https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1147575087140417536?s=21 https://twitter.com/windhorstespn/status/1147582600409600000?s=21 Lol Windy needs a break lmao https://twitter.com/business/status/1147582357958004737?s=21 Did it ever leave? God the Lakers are so washed outside of LeBron and AD I love it Yeah they're pretty bad The east sucks! Also centers are back! God how awesome is it that Anfernee Simons is better than every guard on the Lakers Is he ballin out? I don't have ESPNU smh Im not watching but his stats are good right now 8 points on 60% shooting Little a solid 0-4 Stephen A Smith cutting promos for UFC on ESPN upsets me Hey I dunno Ill take Milwaukee If anyone else wants to take a different team Obviously not giving you the field But you can take the clippers Up to 50 Clippers suck Thats an unfair bet Bucks and sixers are only competing against eachother. While the west has 7 teams with a realistic shot https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1147641243075317760?s=12 omg holy shit ?????? I mean shot at winning? Or making it? Id say all 7 teams have a shot at winning it. Obviously a lot to be determined, like whether clips/lakers gel together bucks/sixers arent like wow teams. Their beatable, each have their flaws The bucks are ?? like the rest of the east U think bucks are Vegas favs Houman? Dylan pick you squad I got Milwaukee Ill take the west nuggets, blazers, clippers, jazz Out of the east yes they are favs But not a clear fav over the sixers. ? Milwaukee is the favorite out of the east 6.5/1 vs Sixers 12/1 Thank you Mark lol https://twitter.com/williamhillus/status/1147500473064120320?s=21 Guy fighting in the UFC tonights nickname is Marreta which is Portuguese for Hammer ? My only question is where is Meyers Leonard 2 ft Hammer tattoo Jazz 18-1 is so juicy Lakers 3-1 is hilarious How did Portland's odds get worse lol Whiteside must really suck Also who on the clippers and lakers is guarding dame and CJ? Just curious I dig that we dropped. Dame plays better mad. Clips are straight up all defensive team Rondo/pat bev both would annoy the shit out of dame. PG on CJ. And idk who on the lakers would guard CJ I totally forgot about Beverly My bad Clips are legit Im dumbfounded by the lakers hype though Kawhi/PG is the best defensive wing tandem the league has seen in decades Lakers are ass tho Agreed They should be 3/1 not the lakers ? ? thats a ??

I thought that was Marc Maron lol Its the cast of modern family Maybe they hired dril Okay what do we honestly think of whiteside I find it odd him and dame are boys Cause Dame isnt a psychopath I think we have a honeymoon period followed by an inevitable bad period then it's anyone's guess what third stage is Whiteside I think will have a Nurkic-esque boost when he comes to Portland Playing with guards who can shoot will be a difference maker "we got shootahs!!!" Nurkic went from one of the least efficient centers to at least average and Hassan is super efficient already Is he going to be a dominant defender and rebounder? Or is he gonna be lazy as fuck and okay 18 min a game He led the NBA in boards one year We are kind of the perfect squad for him National people are down on it Yes I noticed lol But its a risk worth taking especially with only giving up Meyers and Moe He also has the same agent as CJ And blocks Gundy! He was pretty damn good against Portland last year! Need the wolverine meme but it's space looking at a photo of Whiteside B/R Football deleted that tweet already lol Whiteside is gonna play great for us until we trade him for Love in January Dylan. It's gonna be great Is that b/r mural a banksy original? We need to come out of the gates hot ? What if hes an absolute savage? We still ditch him? When nurk comes back? What if dame gets butt hurt https://twitter.com/lil_buts/status/1147937949465497600?s=12 BIG MOOD https://twitter.com/flfawc2018/status/1147942462851309580?s=21 Bigger mood ?? ? USA vs Mexico gold cup final tonight 6pm (They make more money) Kevin Durant changing his number ?????? Sad cause Kawhi stole all the headlines lmao Also he tagged his company 35Ventures. Does he change that to 7Ventures now? SnakeVentures Im no branding expert but that seems dumb Is it sad that Im more interested in the gold cup than the womens World Cup Scissorliga*? https://twitter.com/bruhreport/status/1148008955467055104?s=21 https://rochdaleherald.co.uk/2017/08/15/big-ben-to-be-renamed-massive-mohammed-from-2018/ ?????? Whos watching the gold cup right now Yes sir Its getting feisty That bald fuck Yea I like it. Pizzaro is filthy tho Altidore should have finished that chance earlier Wow! That was close Nah Im not. I only watch good soccer. Need a moment of brilliance from Pulisic Jordan Morris, biggest US Soccer bust since Freddy Adu? Rockets blazers at 7pm too Sports Sports is history - Chad Butler Did I say that? That's a great quote Dam pizzaro twisted that arm WOW Wut happen Watching summer league ?Meyers behind the blazers bench move on guy lol Dam That was filthy he just laid it off for him lmao shoutout to that guy in the chingue a su madre t-shirt they just did a close up on https://twitter.com/trailblazers/status/1148062156778176517?s=12 the blazers did not execute this tweet correctly An attempt was made Trent and Simmons putting in work Simons* They had the right idea for sure Stokes is big Yeah he thicc https://twitter.com/trailblazers/status/1148078184006479873?s=21 Dubov your boy Daum with 4 BIG points MVP BABY LETS GO Whitehead better pick it up if were giving him 27 mil Stranger Things is so good Agreed Dubov - season 2 sucked but its so good this season GTFO season 2 did not suck Hope ur jesting Put some goddamn respect on Bob Newby's name I may be completely off here but fifa shouldnt be paying womens/men equally. USA soccer federation should Yeah thats why the Womens team is suing US Soccer Then why are they complaining that fifa is giving them 60 vs 440 mil. This shouldnt have to do with fifa I just read that the womens made a new collective bargaining agreement recently which significantly bumped up their pay. How can they sue if they agreed upon this new set salary? Yah you could argue Fifa is the only org who can make each counties org pay equal Yeah I think they are also mad that FIFA doesnt really care about featuring the womens game. See: three continental finals on the same day as the Womens World Cup Final. I agree but the world doesnt care for womens soccer yet Its an interesting convo It definitely cares more than it used to Agreed Like one one hand women shouldnt make as much as men because their sports dont make any money They had it on national TV here in Italy But to say World Cup is more interesting than a copa final
Which could have been Brazil vs Argentina is wrong Butttt youre basically saying you can pay certain employees more because your customers are sexist Brock thats the main point Yah I tend to agree with the top point The ceo of Nike makes more than the ceo of new balance I mean doesnt the womens team generate more money? The highest rated games in Us history are all womens games and they just had the highest selling Nike jersey of all time Im talking specifically US Yes in the USA they are on par. But in fifa terms its not even close id be curious but I doubt it Yeah but US soccer pays them and structures how the payouts go The Washington post article that I read said something along the lines of since the World Cup cycles are off set its hard to say who brings in more Thats interesting tho. Us soccer should just pay exactly off their revenue from either Shouldnt be more complex that that Right but it is No The federation makes it that way If it was simple supply and demand the women would make more So womens have a base salary and male dont have a salary. They are based off bonuses only Than the Us men Because mens soccer actually has leagues houman? https://www.google.com/amp/s/beta.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/07/08/are-us-womens-soccer-players-really-earning-less-than-men/%3foutputType=amp Brock this is only for national games As opposed to what Idc about Mls or whatever the womens equivalent is All the elite players who play in the USWL are paid by the national team not the league Yah Im just asking why would the men have a different structure? Im guessing in everyday life they make way more money, so would rather do bonus vs base salary? No idea. Their unions must have negotiated this. It might give the USA mens more incentive to win if their salary is based off winning Right so that would kind of make sense then Women would want the base security since theyre making very little outside Which is ironic considering they actually win lol Ill read that article My thing is that I dont believe fifa should have equal pay for them. But I do agree that USA soccer should considering we are the biggest country (or at least top 3) when it comes to womens soccer and ad revenue Good to know that Im not crazy lol Yeah fifa cant get the sponsorship money as high but US could raise their salary is basically all I say too. I cant speak for the rest of the teams in the world that definitely generate less than their male counterparts ? US women revenue is way higher and they get paid way less. It's pretty simple If the men's team lost every game in the World Cup they'd almost make more than the women winning it all https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/19/us-womens-soccer-games-now-generate-more-revenue-than-mens.html US soccer is also sitting on a $150 million surplus they could dip into Honestly we need ICE to start scouting footballers who dont speak English on the boarder Or build futsal courts in the cages My buddy just brought up an interesting point Yes women have made more revenue in the last World Cup cycle since the men didnt make the World Cup What if we were to compare 2015 womens and 2014 men How about the womens team plays the mens team and if they tie they get equal pay and if the women lose they have to make sandwiches for the men after the match. PUT THIS DEBATE TO REST Id watch Id watch Loser has to go to the White House Okay Ill ask again now: Would you rather get your choice of 3 teams or the field for the ship Field Field For sure - so much movement of talent this FA that there are a solid 5-6 teams in my mind vying for the ship. Field Bucks, Lakers, Clippers, Sixers, Jazz, Nuggets, Warriors, Blazers, 76ers, Rockets are all teams I believe can win it all 1/3 of the league! I think if I got 4 teams I would go lakers clipps bucks and sixers and feel really safe Hammer the under on the 6ers they will crumble this year I would cross out nugs Jazz warriors and zers there Warriors got a shot if Klay comes back in February Over under going to be lit either way The blazers over under is gonna be mid 40s which gets me hard Gundy I bet it's even lower Like 42.5 or something They always dog us ? Add a pick in? Is it worth it tho? Im not sure it is unless its like top 20 protected Or like a couple of seconds Bron is gunna run point Idk how I feel about this because he cant guard a PG He wont Theyll put Danny green on them Or kcp Im interested to see how this plays out They also just got Avery Bradley https://twitter.com/barry/status/1148319099447119873?s=21 https://twitter.com/yahoosportsnba/status/1148335892517597188?s=21 Wtf does this even mean Lol Fultz 2.0? Or they keeping him on the shelf to make him part of a Westbrook trade That would be SUCH a timberwolves move Wiggins + Culver + 2 1sts Jesus Russ will not win a title anywhere The thunder had to realize this the hard way https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1148339906285985792?s=21 This will be an insane move when Presti pulls it off Because they were going to be stuck with that style of play until Russ retired At least the Heat with Russ and Jimmy would be fun Yah best case I bet he goes to the Heat I think Russ could keep the Lakers or clippers from winning Pat Riley will be damned if any of those unprotected picks are good Without even trying. Just because of the player he is. Him and Jimmy in Miami is a match made in heaven Plus that's totally a Riles move Yes lol they will bully Meyers so bad I would entertain the Rockets just because its so crazy it just might work Im all for it Lol gunz I was thinking Rockets also Darrel just throwing a massive Hail Mary Yah westbrok to rockets Paul to Miami and other stuff to okc Why not? Basically keep PJ/Harden/CP and put everyone else on the table Yeah I could see that just because Russ is similar to harden Two of that type of guy just wildly chucking the ball up as many times as humanly possible while everyone watches lol Rec league wet dream It would be kinda like Philly last year A team that doesnt fit at all but has so much talent it will fuck with teams Yeah totally I actually like Philly more now than last year If Simmons cant shoot tho then it just doesnt matter lol God this fucking chat has forced me to just ingest basketball year round Does this year of the NBA have more possible champions than the NFL? Serious q Just in sheer volume This is at least the closest its ever been I mean I think its more similar than ever Where theres a few tiers When normally its cut and dry theres 2-3 teams that have a true shot and no one else no Gundy but its much better NFL has the variable though of anyone can make playoffs/go deep and anyone can suck randomly NFL finally has QBs for everyone also Yes I think you can still make better judgements with less players In the NBA There are less shocking good and bad team 11 teams are under 20:1 in NFL Fair enough that makes sense It literally is just because of 22 men vs 5 on the playing field/court at all times. Same thing with baseball. Too many factors. Leads to more variability but also the NBA hasnt been quite this open in a long time. Im trying to imagine how an nfl team could be +200 at season start Also 1 game playoffs creates more variance boring day at work, looked into it ? Def can see how different this year is, a lot closer to nfl (Log scale y-axis) https://twitter.com/worldwidewob/status/1148354769167060992?s=12 Perez always with the best shit HR Derby is ridiculous Yes Shit is it all star week I had no idea either https://twitter.com/justinjett_/status/1148422946169298944?s=21 I just spit out my beverage https://www.instagram.com/p/BzrfrEEhOIB/?igshid=1ma9gcoiohwrb What a fucking loser. You screen printed a t shirt cool story bro Yeah Ill say it Fuck Marcus Harvey Move over Megan Rapinoe Im not visiting fucking Portland gear God hes such a fucking douche HIS FAMILY GAVE HIM THE MONEY THAT HE USED TO START PORTLAND GEAR AND GET IT OFF THE GROUND HES WORKED SO HARD GUYS Did I ever tell you guys how he told me he goes to a therapist because he hates conformity and his brand has created that? He said he hates conformity and I just went but isnt that sort of what everyone wearing a P hat is doing? And he responded yeah I have to go to therapy over it. This was on the taylors deck like a year ago. The convo started because everyone was wearing one of the yellow charity jerseys Good lord He started that company from the ground up like Hayden Meriwether bought his house in Portland ? It's true. Suns are gonna be a force Thunder fans are going through it https://twitter.com/dillonyoung/status/1148374314779107330?s=21 Wow God Im so out of the loop Is his really happening? Lots of rumors about Miami having interest Woj reported Miamis interest is real Yeah lol Is it weird if I dont know how to feel about it? Westbrook is a generational talent and athlete But they were so disappointing with him and PG Then again the outside of those two the Thunder were total garbage And he heat are still fairly deep I would take them over Indiana and Boston for sure And Brooklyn this year They could be a top 4 seed Id put them as fringe contenders tbh but it really depends what they give up for Westbrook WhAt would pic possibly want? Okc* Ive heard a range of like a big package for Westbrook all the way to okc having to attach stuff just to get rid of him. No one seems to agree what hes worth with the contract https://www.instagram.com/p/BzmNRduH5cD/?igshid=9ypo5cv7fite ZC better be careful. The last two blazers to rep Portland gear got their asses traded... Yeah hard to tell what Russ will fetch I feel like it's gotta be more than just salary relief. Dude is still an all star Yeah I mean he averaged a triple double one year, has an mvp and led multiple playoff teams Ian following you and gundes social you could fool yourself into thinking that you two are on a nice getaway together He's averaged a triple double for 3 straight years lol Same continent! Yeah I mean Westbrook and jimmy are total heat guys Or he goes to Orlando and we get more of what we want ? https://twitter.com/bleacherreport/status/1148600026505056256?s=21 I guess its better than assault rifles NOBODY IS DOING IT WITH DONUTS Dame whiteside pick and roll will be fun ? Butler Westbrook shitshow 7th seed will be more fun though Man how many games did the clippers get against gs? Did Durant play? During the season? Didnt they beat them 3 times? I think it went 6 and want to say kd got hurt in that game He got hurt vs Houston in Game 5 p sure He was healthy for the whole clippers series Clippers 2 seed and Lakers 10th seed. You heard it here first Who the 1? ?Suck it, snowflakes! ? The Knicks have cornered the market on power forwards ?They are more than just a meme https://twitter.com/consequence/status/1148266044227751936?s=21 4D chess whoop whoop God the ESPN mobile app sucks ass Can never play games on my phone Smh Matty I feel like youre entering two phones territory Dude it's rough Social kills my battery too All the photos and shit and posting Lmao my Uber driver had to go left to drop me off but he already accepted a Lyft pickup to the right and now he's driving like Liam neeson in taken when he activates Simons putting up Vlad Jr numbers Goes down bad on final play of game U gotta be fucking kidding me I hope he jus rolled the shit out of his ankle and not worse He's walking now thank God Ya he rolled ankle ?Hey a thing I did was on PTI today Livingston to blazers?

Is it necessary for me to drink my own urine? Its sterile, and I like the taste I didnt realize he was 88 https://www.instagram.com/p/Bzt7wXYhtTi/?igshid=1qtmkrrfkpgx6 What could've been We could bring in Dwight and Livingston to finalize next years roster tho Livingston would be perfect O/U 8 mins a game for Meyers next year Hmmmm I guess Ill go over Spo will be good for him Hes still a decent athlete right? Over Heat are trash 4 seed in the east tho ? Over Boston Indy and Brooklyn? Idk Im just smeering the east Youre smearing* the English language Your * ;) Lol I dunno Hard to get a read on the Heat rn A lot went wrong last year Yah I mean lets not overrate the nets and pacers Or the Celtics I mean the pacers were pretty raw with dipo Id say the heat are easily in their class But who knows if hell be the same player What if we get Russ? Why is Jarrett Allen playing summer league? Ball is life https://www.instagram.com/p/Bzv5xG6FZXG/?igshid=xkz55ohiyv8u Is Seth going to be able to achieve was Wes was unable to in Dallas? ? ? Offseason grades per Yahoo Sports Anytime you unload Myers its 104% offseason grade in my book How the fuck did we get a C? Hmm well theyre still not a contender Dude outsiders are lame Simmons did this too Blazers fans watched this team and saw the weaknesses and they fixed those to an extent. I dont think people see that What Clayton said I'm used to it now. They're never gonna come around I dont think they added a player any other team would want Brock I dont disagree but its more of what these players mean for this team that went to a WCF without its 2nd-3rd best player Brock what are you smiling Smoking Is this like your mariota wont win a game take? Im sure some teams would take hood or bazemore Maybe not Whiteside or bazemore with their contracts but teams would want them They had hood last year And Im including the contracts Youve now got a stop gap with Whiteside until Nurk returns, and are set up to dump him for a good player at the deadline, and youre a better shooting team which is what killed us in the playoffs Sorry cant give greater than a C I dont care if other teams wanted these guys, this is what this team needed. Most teams dont want two guards who do virtually the same thing, but it seems to work in Portland so does it really matter? Its passable but doesnt move the needle One team got Paul George and kawai Leonard. Its a scale I mean this team is better than It was last year, when they made the WCF Were not the Knicks either No indication they rank any higher in their conference Ill admit more than anyone this chat likes to get over zealous about the Zers and Im usually more negative, by these were great moves for what this team needed, and theyre now set up to get a bigger fish at the deadline What grade do you give them Brock if they run it back and dont do bazemore it Whiteside trade? Also as great as the LA teams look on paper, Kawhi, AD and PG all have massive injury concerns. D Hey dont get me wrong The moves themselves are great All those moves work and zers fans should be glad they did them But like zoom out and look at the league What grade do the Sonics get? Theyve been held back awhile Dude happened to me in school its no biggie Brock is that professor everyone hates Brock you sound like the bagel boss right now YOURE NOT MY BOSS NEIL OLSHEY I agree with Brock Except then why do the hawks get an A-? Anyone wanna quit their job and start a food cart in sowa I got a deal from a friend for 5k ? Have him bring it down to the mouth Damn I kept thinking the girl at the ice cream shop spoke like Uma Thurman, then I realized its her and Ethan Hawked daughter Hawkes Forgot she got this role I heard about this a while ago. Ive only seen 1 of these movies in full. Mark if you guess the movie I will make cucumbers for your food truck https://twitter.com/sheaserrano/status/1149151840166170624?s=12 Inglorious Basterds I have seen three Y'all don't watch John wick? Ive seen 8 You guys havent seen all of these? Deep blue sea ultimate classic, weird science probably gets most of you I dont really watch action movies Ive seen I am Legend, John Wick, and Inglorious Basterds Also if you havent seen the drop I recommend One of gandolfinis last movies I pre ordered this also like 8 months ago lol Im a movie nerd. Its actually beyond uncool. I might watch em all now and then get it Thats also just first two chapters Ive seen 11 Idk what the drop is tbh Most of those are on TNT like every day Tom hardy and Gandolfini Dylan Its dope Oh shit duh I got 14 https://twitter.com/sheaserrano/status/1149160782338371584?s=12 17 here How the hell does someone mention so many movies in 2 chapters? He uses scenarios as the baseline of the chapter and talks about characters from these movies within the structure of the scenario. Who would be the best character to be your wingman at the bar? Then hell mention characters from these movies. Its a fun read. Ah that actually sounds relatively interesting Rengel has seen Speed, Guranteed You win! When do I start? Wait wait. How does going from Enes Kanter and Meyers Leonard to Hassan fucking Whiteside not help? God damn stranger things 3 was so awesome Yeah it ruled ?Well this game is finally dead how is Steve McNair worth $5? Hes dead Wow broken legs arent ok but jokes about murder... OPEN SEASON Yeah now youre starting to get it Its not a potentially career ending injury if your career is already over Its ok he probably had sickle cell and was going to die soon
-Dubov if a guy was still playing and got sickle cell, wow that would be devastating 7-11 has free strawberry slurpees today what about cherry? Omg can I make a leg joke? ? Why would somebody create that gif Idk I actually wanna throw up now ? Lol Lol what'd they do Out of shape I think Sources said it was done for the competitive integrity of the league or some shit Lol Oh I thought they got in trouble haha ? WTF Apparently the thunder want herro, bam and justice for Winslow They want 2/3 But Winslow has to be included due to him having a legit contract value If I were the hest Id give Winslow, dragic ans herro Yeah maybe I dunno if the thunder would take that I cant imagine they would get another better Dragic is an expiring 18 mil so thats a plus Maybe like a protected first rounder also?? I dont wanna lose herro lol He looks so fun I agree but Westbrook/ butler would have a better chance of doing damage in the playoffs now Yeah who knows That d would be brutal But I dunno if dragic can stay healthy this year We could still do some damage Well see how jimmy ha does being #1 Its been a while Depth matters Girth too **immediately signs Raymond felton** Blazers summer league game starts now ?U know I had to cop the kawhi new balance tracksuit Also got really scared looking at that seeing the white spot on the pants but it's on the mirror thank God ??

rockets are allowed to play with two basketballs during game Presti is the man Wow ? Young King ? Lol the NBA is ridiculous I love it The off season is better than the season By far Its like in BPP when we would do a fantasy draft smoke a bowel then do like 3 trades each before we even played Then only play one game each before we did it all over again Space, thoughts on the utter collapse of the SuperSonics KD shouldve gone to the rockets ?Legendary ? ?Top comment "Bradley Beal and rui hachimura" This is absurd Where is Dame & Hassan? Do you guys think Chris Paul gets traded now? Or steph and klay said a three teamed heat okc and Houston two days ago think thats still the goal Oh I thought this trade was finalized It is but doubt okc wants grumpy CP on the team all year Id take cp Hes still really good We are really specifically looking for bad players.

Who said it? Trump referring to undocumented migrants or Scott Perry referring to the Knicks offseason plans? Alright where is CP going? Miami?

But he definitely ain't the smartest dude in the room At his intro presser he said he's excited cuz we made the WCF the last 2 years.

Still Hes a 76 on 2k As good as my college GPA and I have a job so im in Need to know his favorite Spanish spot ASAP Show the receipts Chad. Lets goo Olshey is getting everyone he tried to sign in 2016. Chandler Parsons is next ? Honestly pau sucks And all the mentor ship shit everyone is projecting is only happening cause hes white Im upset Gunz whoa You been drinking ? Joakim woulda been a way better leader for young Zach and Hassan Yes I have Arent they similarly eh? They are but Joakim is 5 years younger And still serviceable Pau is WASHED Fuck I didnt realize he was 5 years younger Also he had Thibs minutes tho! Thats worth at least 3 extra years So hes only 2 younger He also had like a 4 year sabbatical for the Knicks lol Pau played for thibs for like a year! So hes really 41 Ah damn good math Im drunk Lol I love it But I also selfishly wanted to smoke with Joakim Noah And Pau definitely does not smoke Also what I hear from highkin about pau doesnt encourage me Hes lowkey very entitled Apparently Damn gundy way to kill my high I am kinda worried about wing depth tho. Having Aminu Harkless and ET to throw at elite wings on D was clutch Now we got 6'5 bazemore and string bean Rodney Hood I dont think Hezonja and Tolliver are bad defensively Theyre just not great Hopefully Little can have an OG type rookie impact on D Same with those guys, we cant turn the screws on the same way we used to But theyre OK Ive become an offense first guy outside of big men Little Nassir X Factor Wow Also what about Shaun Livingston to fill the last spot. Take some pressure off Simons Strong You can tweet that mark Mark is a blog boy Content aggregator Windy hates you mark I would fuck Windy up Windy is defintely 58 right?

Nike has their own Clear line now? Can confirm its real having flown delta out of pdx refently *recently Jesus Its not a clear line lol Its a delta baggage check in line First Betsy Ross gets put on the No Fly List and now Nike employees get their own tsa line.. wow Have i mentioned that Grayson Gatzke works in the building next to mine and I see him randomly? Most writers who go on tv are pretty good or at least decent. Dave mcmenamin on the other hand is terrible. Idk how he's on the jump Was very tempted to ask him if he still has the burner in the glove compartment in front of his colleagues ? Lmaoooo Mark did you make that The PF Chang's is a phenomenal touch. Very few will get that lol Naw Palladino made this that one summer Just found it on my phone 2014! Lol I'm fucking dying. What a summer Nothing says rager like lettuce wraps and all you can drink blue moons ???????? Palladino also photoshopped that one pic of the girl that looked like me but wont admit it Wait I dont get the of Changs That summer when Grayson went psycho and ran from the cops, he was on this strange money spending spree. So some of us were living in Eugene and he threw a "party" at his house (which like 12 people showed up to), and Grayson bought a shit ton of PF Changs to go, and Blue Moons for everyone at this party. Weird flex But I ate my weight in crispy honey chicken on graysons dime so I wasn't mad Different than the guy that left his car in alleyway and fled on foot or same guy Im no psychologist but that sounds like a manic episode Lmaoooo The day he rolled up in his STI I knew we were all going to get some good life memories ?Wow 47.5 wins for Portland.

I think we have all 15 guys already We're at 14 yeah? 2 way doesn't count as a spot Oh ok! I thought we had 14 before pau but I was wrong ? I bet Olshey leaves it open to start the year tho. For an unbalanced trade or a buy out Yeah we already will have a lot of wings to potentially play if we include hezonja but JR would be good insurance Livingston could be kinda clutch too Yeah but having a shooter cant hurt And hes not a bad defender Truuuuu What about melo lol https://www.instagram.com/p/B0cvQRJFTvT/?igshid=ey5baoen5flx Odd duo I could also be down for Jeremy Lin Having that hardcore Asian support could be key come playoff time Jeremy Lin brings a Championship winning mindset we havent seen before https://twitter.com/audhubillah/status/1155310859176091655?s=21 ? https://twitter.com/thesportsjim/status/1155522293713571841?s=21 https://twitter.com/chold/status/1155907484583747584?s=21 This just reminded me that a spurs video coordinator spoke at the Mitchell Robinson camp and a kid asked him about LaMarcus coming back to Portland and the guys response was very matter of factly yeah he might Keep LA away How would he comeback? Free agency or trade? If it's free agency I wonder how much a pay cut he'd take I'd take him back tho why not Yeah Blazers arent good enough to say no to good players His contract next season is only partially guaranteed. Spurs could waive him if it's mutual to part ways and we'll have cap space next summer I think Draymond should be target number 1 if he doesn't sign an extension Already scouting burger week https://www.portlandmercury.com/events/26831189/grapeful-dead-bbq-burger Whens burger week Next week starting Aug. 5 https://twitter.com/highkin/status/1155906541314138114?s=21 Damn Simons is gonna be getting heavy minutes from the jump Where is Andre Miller it just clicked for me that Pau is gunna love Portland Who wouldnt want to retire after winning the championship Jeremy Lin could take notes https://twitter.com/raf_tyler/status/1156008480148357120?s=21 Wtf is this Outlaw baby!

New phone background Mmmmm Look at them legs baby, those are some legs can carry a dynasty! ? That Oliver maroney?

The casuals are coming to our side Shout-out trillballins ? ? ? New sign in the stalls today Wowowowow No phones! Just shit and think about it ? Haha wow that is next level mark Jesus its like they just expect you to ponder life or something How many shitters do you have and how many employees? Need a ratio Lmao Ehhh lemme think theres like 200 people on the floor and 2 shitters Male female breakdown probably like 7/3? So like 140 dudes to 2 pots PNW Passive Aggression is exceptional CJ extended! Oh boy that's a lot of money Going all in baby Just get draymond or LA next summer and we gucci Id rather pay CJ that than give Jamal Murray 175 mil Modern day Porter/Drexler Oh yeah. I'm with you. I was firm in the trade CJ camp until end of last season + playoffs I'm all in on CJ now. He's a killer Jamal Murray is ass Its between us and Houston for the best backcourt until Klay is back Would love a big Jamal Murray regression year to stick it to all the nuggets fans Agreed mark CJ next 5 years: $157 mil
Kemba next 4 years: $141 mil 

I'll take CJ's deal every day of the week Crazy today this Oh Hellz yeah To say But it would actually be kinda sick If the warriors won next year Fuck that I get what you are saying but fuck alllll that ITS OUR TIME Fuck off or get kicked out the chat Ian Oh lol Yeah u guys arent gonna win No warriors love allowed We might! That's why we play the game Not saying we are going to but we have a solid chance its called sport I disagree! But maybe! Most wide open the league has been in a decade This is true I think it depends on klay But mostly I see the clippers dominating God I fucking hate uneducated armchair gm's on Twitter. Such bad takes 

"Portland doesn't have any money for a 3rd player now" It's called an extension which doesn't start for two more seasons. Doesn't change our cap position next summer Clippers are gonna fuck Are they? Idk I gotta see how it plays out whats the whole roster look like Kawhi has already been the best player in the playoffs 3 times now Now he has Paul George and Lou Williams Not having PG for potentially the first six weeks could hurt since Kawhi has to be load managed Montrez will only get better Fair, and dont forget pat bev But the raptors were crazy deep This is true but they also had no a-listers Clippers are legit af dude they're gonna get the 1 seed https://twitter.com/arielhelwani/status/1156225503306629121?s=21 I hate that the Trumps are MMA fans Doc will have them with homecourt at least Oh wow hot take alert Beverley, Trez, Harkless, Landry Shamet, Lou Williams is plenty of help But PG being out hurts their ceiling as a top 2 seed ?CJ will be the 20th highest paid player in 2021 when his extension kicks in. And that'll be way lower once more guys sign extensions. I'll take it Also poor wizards lol If we have two of the 30 best guys in the league at two top 20 prices thats good value to me CJ gotta be close to that top 20 now too He's closer to 20 than 30 Kawhi is also like the most malleable dude in the league He can fit into any system right away Can we talk about if LeBron is a good father or not..? https://twitter.com/actionnetworkhq/status/1156253488298504196?s=21 Kawhi is gonna be fine and the clippers will be too but the west is gonna be like the fucking SEC this year It could be like that year when the 48 win suns missed the playoffs 100% 9 seed at 45.5 wins im taking the over OKC and Minnesota could be sneaky good And maybe Sac Yeah and then Dallas is the hipster team They have like 6 centers but still ? Ohhhh fuck yeah Dame is global The shot heard round the world Going to trigger the fuck out of Chad ? Lol what is this I dunno he posted it as part of a collage You're right. I'm triggered Okay call me crazy but I think this is the year CJ could make the all star game If Portland is in the top 3 by all star votes He could get in on the team success merit Also the playoff performance matters to coaches Who chose the reserves Whiteside All Star is a lock ?? With Klay out it's basically gonna be a tossup for the last guard spot between CJ, Derozan, Mitchell & Conley, and Murray ? Derozan has fewer iconic playoff moments than CJ and like 5 all-star games Honestly the East was basically socialism for all-star bids ??Heyyy you guys ? ? (In response to rengels post not my post) Going to a screening of Hobbs & Shaw tonight boys Fucking pumped to see the Rock pull a helicopter down to the ground with a rope Is that how LA people say going to see Hobbs & Shaw Ya but its before its out so he has to say screening To remind u that ur impoverished Was not my intention but my LA is definitely showing and thats embarrassing Yeah cam you've gone Hollywood on us Just got home I think I might screen season 3 of stranger things tonight Good choose ?

Am I blinded by hate? Or are the majority of blazers fans filthy causals People do now that hes gone lol Things to consider https://twitter.com/meyersleonard/status/1158070601682059264?s=21 Well this is how I saw that lol That Isiah Thomas/Meyers Leonard block stat was the nail in the coffin I was always more pro-Meyers than most but I hate the Meyers Revisionism that is already happening I couldnt read past the first time. It was a lot of detail I dont care about lol I stand with dufferduck66 At one point, the Moda Center had been a source of some of my deepest pain. But as I sat there on May 20, 2019, it didn't feel real. People were on their feet, but I couldn't stand. When the crowd began to chant Meyers name my body lost feeling. I was trying to soak in the moment, but I was numb. I felt my eyes start to swell and, as I was on the verge of tears, my cry seemed to run dry. I havent read it but that sounds like she plagiarized one of quicks articles and inserted herself Omg Meyers is the softest man to walk this earth Funny thing is Michael would 100% say that to his face Yah like what wasnt true or even rude about what he said ?Jesus Christ this is so dramatic The Story of How the Dog Died Just saw Teddy Blacked in the streets of north portland God that Meyers story is pathetic What a baby food soft bitch Gunz I cant believe you supported him so long Omg your job relocated you to Miami that sounds so painful Wait whats that? Your employer is handling all of the logistics? However will you manage? Its also the first time he was traded in like 8 years in the league Jamal Crawfords wife didnt write an op ed Yeah that story was nauseating. You're a fuckin pro athlete dude suck it up Whatever dude he has a skill doesnt mean Im not happy we have Hassan instead Hes gonna be sick on the heat The Meyers revisionism is what I will fight Meyers is out the league in....6 months? Im on the frontlines of preventing that bullshit Over Hes a shooter He can be the center Anthony Tolliver Rap Name Mehmet Okur But Hassan is so much better Like we arent idiots I think the west knows how garbage he is, and the east will find out before Christmas. Hell get traded and waived and then Mrs. Leonard can right a blog about all the wonders of China Anybody nationally telling us Hassan is worse than Meyers and Kanter is being intellectually dishonest I dont think Meyers will be sick on the heat tbh Dude him and Kelly are gonna be amazing Lol dude Amazing? These guys are right lol hes an 8 year bet Vet* Hes fully baked man Well hes good at shooting and the heat guys are not good at that Like Luke Babbitt was lit for them And he never scored 25 in a half in the conference finals Wait Kai got engaged? https://twitter.com/bubbaprog/status/1158382214612230144?s=21 Dingus couldnt point out Ohio on a map if you have him 100 tries and circled it so I doubt he knows the difference between Dayton and Toledo His nose breathing triggers me so bad Its awful The Baxter Holmes interview on Longform Podcast is pretty good. Probably most relevant for our resident big-J Journo but its interesting Damn Ill have to check it Pod Save America Live and An Evening with Anderson Cooper are on the same night in Portland. An impossible decision for the libs. My god https://twitter.com/CNBCnow/status/1158509730601590785 Hooray! Its okay its a small market globally Dylan I thought you only sold to Japanese gorilla dogs not the dirty chinese Team USA games are going to be live streamed on Twitch Ninja cant watch team USA ?? Im doing some nba round table mailbag thing and one of the questions is have dame and CJ reached their ceiling? ?? Maybe they have and thats pretty fucking good Why is that even a question as if its not good enough? Lol Crazy being the second best backcourt duo in the NBA Klay has a torn ACL First probably without Klay around Dame and CJ best backcourt until proven otherwise Dont @ me No @ing needed thats just a fact. What about Kyrie Irving and Spen---lmao nvm I cant even say it CJ also has one of the top ten sports podcasts according to Esquire while Dame is out dropping tracks. Multi-faceted mother fuckers right there. Also fuck Kyrie for just not showing up to his nike photoshoot. Straight up ghosted. Wow Who does he think he is, Odell Beckham Jr??? He also showed up to a Kyrie Spongebob event NOT wearing the Spongebobs. He was wearing Cortez Kennys Not great! Obviously dont share that beyond this group. Just ridiculous, though. I mean, lets just say Ive heard a lot outside of this group that is concerning about Kyrie. Kyrie's a loose cannon The fact that people still think he's better than Dame blows my mind How much does it have to suck to be at work and have Kyrie ask you shit like what does government mean to you? Dame is having his Drexler moment. Unreal talent but playing in the same era as a transformational star at his same position (Steph) which won't ever get him past 2nd best pg in the league Honest to god Im surprised Kyrie hasnt been punched by one of his teammates yet All this talk about top 50 rapper lists has me wondering when Brock is gonna do an updated Sigep sexiest list Need Brock to create a SigEp lunch table meme Who wants to sit at table 3 with Ian Fadden, Theo Dutrow, and Danny Cobb? Omg Nick Schramm, D2 and Jules Or is d2 and Jules the same person? Never really committed these facts to memory I mean, they essentially are.

It's like here's an alphabetical list of my favorite 60 movies with The Godfather as number 1 cuz that's what everyone says and the 43% won My guess is he thought of two movies ? And then copy pasted a bunch of others Yeah let's be honest. This isn't a real list if it's missing Shooter Lol green book is on there ? ^ The Green Book In one photo Lol I was thinking about this with the Russians the other day You can say whatever the fuck you want about the Russians Sorry Dubov Also just heard Kazemi is not playing in the World Cup But Hadadi is Dumb question, didnt Bruce Arians retire? But now hes coaching the bucks? Nah the bucks are in the NBA He came out of retire just because jameis is his toughest challenge Hes coaching the Bucs, and yes he retired because he also had major health issues He just wants to prove hes QB god I also think he has a place in Florida, wife likes it there, etc. it was a good fit for him Hes from Louisiana I think Him and Lil Wayne are boys Nah pittsburgg Pittsburgh* Ahh my b It says Jersey online, but I know hes a PA guy Not Pitt necessarily but Pennsylvania from what he said on pardon my take Ahhh Cool cool Also its kinda obvious old dude bad health boom Florida Yeah I also think his ego believes he can turn Jameis into a stud I mean he turned Carson Palmer into a God so why not Lol you want that narrative so bad I could see Jameis being done after the year Its a win-win for Ariana Arians Totally Like that was a dumpster fire If it works hes a genius and if it doesnt Jameis gets dumped Florio said Florida was a big thing for him Florida is dope if youre in the right place I thought he said he had a place in Tampa Ehhh idk Florida is gross except Miami Ive been to Boca, Orlando and Jupiter St. Petersburg and Tampa are p cool St. Pete for sure Ive heard that I kinda wanna go when I visit my parents Also Orlando is just really big its whatever They have the theme parks Thats kinda it? And just a fuck ton of people Sidebar: getting very excited for day betting possibilities during the FIBA World Cup St Pete is great! I bet theres something to love about Orlando but my experience is its the blandest place on earth Basically what Gundy said https://mobile.twitter.com/fourloko/status/1161402554712039424 THEYRE BACK Ive never had a claw But Ill be damned if I dont support my fucking brand 14% ! Hot damn Need Mad Dog 20/20 Seltzers ASAP Im just so proud of Loko for not resting on their laurels Innovate or die Ive seen this somewhere... https://twitter.com/markbrisbois/status/1161434894934798336?s=12 I run my tweets through the JCSL 2 thumbs up in 60 second is an auto tweet Thats fair. Just giving you a hard time lol Oh I pressure test content in the JCSL all the time If anyone wants to use any of my jokes in here there fair game. This is my Twitter haha Lol do I need to start releasing LigaClout ratings? All I ask for is 25 cents for every like after 10 I routinely tell people things regarding the NBA and use my sources are saying when Im just referring to the JCSL Same here but I just say feb 9th Wait Im out on this what is feb 9th The Heatles visit the Rose Garden We getting a box? I was in and out during that part of the convo yesterday Oh yes thats right Or rip city row Thats pretty affordable Im down for either of those Lets get rip city row and register the group as Houman mirtorabi for president That would be lit Houman Heads! Houman/Hassan 2020 Always talked about it in college and we never got them made Now is our chance ? ? Rip City row for sure Lol this dude had one of those bumper stickers with the kid peeing and he was peeing on "Lakewood PD". Isn't that just asking to get pulled over every time you leave your house Im so curious what happened with Lakewood PD that led him to getting a custom sticker made Haha great point https://twitter.com/cnn/status/1161391991323791361?s=12 ooooo damn the GOP is gonna be so pissed when they hear about this They might boycott penguins Remember when I said Herbert will have a better career than Luck? Guys one toe injury away from an early retirement Yeah his leg is all kinds of fucked it sounds like And now he's got the yips Jacoby brisset back baby I think our Salem league is going to 2 QBs so this is important QB is fatty deep Dont even draft one wait till Sunday at 9 (In single QB) Gundy if youre going 2 QB Id recommend super flex just fyi so if you want to start another position you can The cbs fantasy guy had a great stay yesterday We have a league vote on Sunday Anyway, nobody has been a top 5 fantasy QB in consecutive seasons since drew brees in 13-14 Love that I have another stat Last year, no early round QB finished the year in his same draft position Rodgers, Watson, Brees, etc. Rarely do you actually get a QB1 or QB2 who finishes the year there, and last year, as with most years, drafting a qb late ended up paying off, ie Mahomes being the biggest example Which is why 2QB is great Rodgers QB1 finished QB9, that is how you suck in your league I mean 2QB has its place Also get rid of kickers Its not traditional, but its not bad Yeah thats a bit radical for me A bit too hokey Kickers are like a random number generator May as well do IDP also Kickers matter in real football tho idk I kinda like it Kickers are not necessarily random Yah they are Its about the offense theyre on no its not actually Its also about their weather conditions they play in Justin Tucker finally fell off last year Even tho hes still the GOAT Yeah hes still K1 in a lot of cases Regardless I am fine with kickers, that is not nearly the same as IDP lol Its worse than IDP! Lol no its not Our league had a 1 year IDP experiment and it was awful lmao Especially if IDPs get pts for TDs, that is the biggest random BS you could have Even tho I personally benefitted from it that season Yah a lot of people give 5 points for a 50 yard fg Also Brock, you realize tackles are barely an accurate stat? Im not arguing for IDP I am saying at least making a kick is a thing Im saying youd never do it and kickers are the same thing 5 points! Also if an offense plays a good defense, thats usually a better day for kicker IDP sucked ass In a dome, even better There are things you can project a bit more 1 of 11 guys on a defense, thats fucking random Brock, the Seahawks fan, hates kickers GO FIGURE Aaron Donald is wayyyy more predicatably better in IDP than Clowney than zurlein is better than the bills kicker At least with kicker u get the exhilaration of seeing if ur guy hits a 50 yarder or w/e , with IDP I was trying to track linebackers and see if maybe they got a share of a tackle 15 yards downfield You also believe in Jesus and the burning bush and child molestation like your QB? yah you may enjoy the kicker drama but again its just a random number generator Im a believer of if they score real points in real football they should be real points in fantasy IDP is also random Yup Also again, tackles are not a stat you should give pts for because you cant record it accurately Maybe it should be adjusted but I think points are points Im fine with eliminating kickers but if were eliminating all the wild cards lets kill head to head scoring while were at if. Thats the lions share of the pts for an IDP Lol Jesus guys You guys do 2 QB, no kicker, rotisserie leagues? Yah I like the top 6 on a week get a win See that is also a huge part of the strategy when you have head to head Fantasy is a week to week game This is all too radical I cant process it Thats such bullshit Clayton explain that Ian this is our Salem league rationale lmao Every week you want to score as many points as possible Just because you have a guy at the end of the year who had a bunch of pts if he gets it in 60% of his games, then the other 40% lays an egg he doesnt help you You cant prepare for an opponent Fantasy is a week to week game was last years motto lmao There are scoring share stats that show a players true value and its a much better indicator Scoring % or something I cant remember the stat, but fantasy footballers talks about it all the time ? yah week to week #quicksand Sure but with what Brock said Meaning top 6 is one win Yes ia gree One huge week shouldnt lock up playoffs Thats still irrelevant Yeah I get what Brock is saying Im in two fantasy baseball leagues I know what rotisserie is Weekly scoring makes sense yes but maybe not head to head Or top 6 wins whatever you wanna call it My dream is two wins are possible per week Holy shit I did not realize that the Four Loko Seltzer is.. 14% ABV!!! One for head to head And one for top 6 Someone is gonna die I disagree with you guys since its not like if your guys happened to all be good one week Keep that rivalry and shit talk but make everyone look out for everyone else Has nothing to do with consistency But Im ok with Brocks solution I like the thrill of defeating my opponent tho , of besting someone in pure head to head competition. This is watered down if Im just trying to get top6 its basically soccer. Bc I can see a lot of people giving up early Right so do both Again there is strategy involved either aw y Way* What does head to head scoring we want a safety net Clayton! Have to do with how you build your team clay? Boom or bust guys dont really give you the same type of value that someone who is more consistent will You build week to week space Lol Dude youre not drafting 11 book or bust guys DeSean Jackson for instance, terrible throughout his career as a head to head fantasy player Yeah I was gonna say head to head is great content In all seriousness there are micro moves in head to head. Playing a receiver knowing your opponent is playing the receivers QB to try and hedge their production. Stuff like that Totally Matty thats true Yeah see thats an argument im not sure if that type of strategy actually works matt Youre playing Rodgers so I play ty montgomery and hope they go run heavy I also dont really go that route Matty, I just play the best guys lol Yeah at least it makes baseline sense though You just have to believe right I feel ya RB vs QB makes a lot of sense If you believe theyll take TDs Always love the like ohh my opponent is starting Larry Fitz, gotta get Skelton in !! Bahahaha The RB vs QB is certainly legit if youre mad favored to lose May as well roll it if you need juice The rush of those red zone moments is great too Also both of my main leagues are auction now And .5 pt ppr Yeah draft strategy is gonna be way different this year Doing a practice Skype auction with my dad today lol How do you even mock draft auction Auction is the shit So fun You can mock it, but more important just know your values The real strategy is driving prices so others pay more, but Year 1 it wont be as easy for everyone to do it ? Oops wrong chat Lol And the first low key flex of the day goes to..... Lot of action in the liga this morning Jesus Brock no one cares about your 8 man league with your buddies No kicker, 2 qb, rotisserie style, 4 flex league*** IDP https://twitter.com/nba2k/status/1161670900799774720?s=21 2k classic squads Black sports online has the best headlines lmao ? wow We are gonna lose in China for sure lmao https://twitter.com/thesteinline/status/1161742830135414784?s=21 Our guys just got waxed by a G League squad Honestly we should send the G league all starts Like why not https://twitter.com/oldschoolboston/status/1161627394811269120?s=12 USA got balled up by Travis Wear and Scotty Hopson ???? ?The fuck https://twitter.com/genepark/status/1161754851803578368?s=21 Lol I mean we were in college during the great recession so we didnt directly feel the pain. (Fully acknowledging that our families likely did and we indirectly felt that) Wow Alex the 1% Dubov I wish I was the 1% I feel like the recession didnt REALLY end until like 2013 but your point stands it wasnt like we were in the workforce fulltime But none of us got laid of in 2008 or got foreclosed on or any of that shit Yeah I think thats what Dubov is saying We havent faced like Being unable to find work for long periods Yeah I mean even when I did I was able to live at home So its not the same right But Gen Z literally has no memory of it lol You also picked a super competitive career, I mean being in like take anything I can get mode And still no luck Honestly I learned so much about peoples grind working in the service industry before I got a real job. I only worked part time but most people I worked with had like 4 jobs. But again this was like 2011-ish when things were getting better According to Ben Shapiro if you work more than two jobs its a you problem It hurts the our parents demo the most really https://twitter.com/kendrickperkins/status/1161767777830678529?s=21 Hahahah Question.

Bro Im 1000% behind just making the g-league all stars our team They actually care! Lol ^THAT You could root for them so much more also Jeff Van Gundy gives so many more shits about it than Pop Lebron getting a gold medal is not that cool to me You can see Pop just so over it in the clip lol We also win every game by like 40 "It looks like in that video that we lost" -Houman Plus if we win we can be like psh our jv team is better than the rest of the world And if we lose we can be like Psh Those werent even our good players Wow torn ACL for boogie Shit Fucking awful man He was gonna have a chance for a bounce back this year too Bounce right outta the league ? Lmaoooo Jesus boogie is done for Time to hang it up Dumbass should have taken that pelicans offer smh IIRC they offered him 3/$60M after the Achilles tear but he was insulted and though he could take the MLE from golden state and prove himself as a max guy after winning a ring Oh wow it sounds like SVG is going to Turner ? Has it dropped by 1000 points? I dont watch the markets It dropped 800 yesterday alone I dont think its a real tweet unfortunately https://twitter.com/jasonlieser/status/1161814445359882240?s=12 Hell yeah go ducks ? Da Bears Trubiscuit make or break season ?Lmao Im out on the NFL but I do love me some Kyle Long loose cannon content Didnt realize til now that Anthony Tolliver was the player in the michael Beasley gif til now https://twitter.com/duncansmithnba/status/1161955900514603008?s=12 Hey, are the Duck WRs gonna suck this year? Because last year, freaking WOOF All depends on juwan Johnson and Micah Pittman Theyre supposed to be pretty good this year but I think we just lost one for the season Call me crazy but I feel Johnny Johnson will have a good yr Schooler is out at least 6 weeks - could redshirt Does Jeff mahel have any eligibility left Hes eligible to provide you with some cost-effective insurance options Ask him on linkedin Youre crazy if you think Johnny Johnson is gonna be good That guy couldnt catch a cold butt naked in Siberia He was solid as a frosh no reason he cant bounce back Plus lets all get tix together for the wazzu game Rengel I love you for believing in Jonny Johnson I cant get there As long as he doesnt have the highlighter green hair he will be just fine His catch v Nebraska is what makes me a believer lol CJ and Love on the same episode of the shop? They've been hanging out a lot. CJ better be recruiting I dont think Love really needs to be recruited. I think hes very willing to come here. I think Neil is the one that needs convincing Or is it the Cavs that need convincing Good point Neil got me optimistic with all his wheeling this summer. He might be on board The Cavs have two big reasons to keep him: Sexton and Garland. Having an All-Star big would make their development a lot easier Id rather get Lamarcus I'm game for a Lamarcus reunion. Blake seems like a pipe dream. Gallo could be an option if OKC sucks this year Yeah I think the Spurs wouldnt be mad to get Zach Collins or something for LA either Fits with their age curve better I feel like I would rather have ZC than LMA Long term Then I think its a good trade for us tbh if we dont give up any additional draft capital. The window is now. Trumpito wants to buy Greenland. Oh yeah no trading ZC for me. I say we just try getting LA during free agency next year I disagree Zac is no sure thing at all You guys would be legit contenders with LA Hes still really good You only get so many chances Fair point We already know he wants to come back. Why send ZC to SA when we could have them both GREEDY CAM ?Kevin Pelton is a bum What cam said LET ME BE GREEDY I would do it lol Former known LMA hater Cam Smith now wants it all Also ill never forgive LA Im not giving up ZC for that bum Kevin Pelton is when analytics go wrong Cam you gotta understand 40 wins??? 35% chance to make playoffs ??? Gtfo If you love something Sometimes you have to set it free Dallas?!? I dunno San Antonio already proved theyre willing to hold out Hes my dopalgangar also I need a halloween costume Also its just one projection model With kawhi Free free, set them free His models always do that. So dumb. Watch a fucking game nerd Also I heard San Antonio might max derozan. They're not trying to rebuild https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSGl3d4KOMk Would rather not throw the kitchen sink at LA if we can watch him crawl back in free agency next year and retire where he belongs I honestly cant tell if Cam wants LMA or not lol Its so passive aggressive Is Hassan and ZC the kitchen sink? If we think he could come next summer for free I would hold onto ZC At least LA could throw us a bone and be transparent this time Let just sign Wes robin LA batum and Steve Blake to vet minimums and have them be our second unit I want to watch LA come crawling back on his own accord, essentially validating he is dumb. Then I will love him again. Removed an exclamation from I want to watch LA come crawling back on his own accord, essentially validating he is dumb. Then I will love him again. Removed an exclamation from I want to watch LA come crawling back on his own accord, essentially validating he is dumb. Then I will love him again. I mean if we end up with him via a trade I will learn to love him again - but ill be glaring at him for the first 1/4 of the season from the sidelines for sure. Isnt ZC like 20 years old? Guy has 3-4 more years before we can even gauge his potential White Giannis! Hes 21 Yeah lol I dunno how true that is Simmons recognized the Ringer Union, what a Cuck! Honestly I feel like believing too much in youth is the new market inefficiency Young players are overvalued in the league now IMO Yea who wants fast paced, high flying basketball??? Screw Zion, wheres Andre Miller!!! How about guys who can get buckets? I vote for that philosophy LA and Nurk would be erotic ? 52 points not enough for you?!?! LaMarcus doesnt call Klay Thompson a hoe but hes better at basketball by a lot lol But Neil probably wouldnt do it I see the argument I just would roll the dice now rather than wait If Simons is actually nice this year we're gonna fuck Yeah either way that RPM projection is ass Dallas is not a playoff team. But RPM never likes the blazers I wish ESPN let KP use the model he created But hes a company man so hes gotta do RPM lol It's literally pointless. If it's never accurate year after year then why do they still publish that shit Like dude the 8 seed is gonna have 46+ wins this year Whoever it is Yeah computers cant handle the West ?? I joined a madden league at work. If anyone wants to whoop me for practice im all for it. Havent bought the game since like 2009 Come at me bro Kyler murray is a savage on madden God it isnt even Saturday yet and Im already so fucking pissed at these tiny dick racists for their stupid fucking riots The Browns are my squad I cant wait to escape to Salem this weekend and avoid all of that proud boy shit lol Fuck the proud boys, fuck patriot prayer, fuck rose city antifa, fuck anybody who is responsible for property damage and violence on Saturday.

Because of the riots The only one Ive heard thats planning to be open is Serra Honestly those uptight racist fucks could benefit from a hit of that tasty, tasty jeb. Can someone fill me in Portland's penchant for rioting Very lax freedom of speech and assembly laws and low likelihood of prosecution Combined with an extremely left demographic that is a target for extreme right wing groups Interesting No riots in Orange County lol God bless coastal conservatives I'm slowly turning into Dylan living in my 85% white suburb. I swear the other day Fox News just appeared on my tv. I didn't even turn it on Basically groups like the Proud Boys know our mayor is a pussy and they can get a rise out of the community with little to no repercussions But there was cement in that milkshake My milkshake brings all the proud boys to the yard https://twitter.com/onionsports/status/1162444834558423041?s=21 OC has nothing to riot about its 99% white and stay at home moms who are sleeping with their neighbors gardener Portland is like 99% white too lol The people rioting arent even from here for the most part Its nice this time of year. You can riot and then see the falls What does any white person have anything to riot about in this country? Go home youre drunk Very fair I forget I grew up in the only non-white part of the city They all come down from SoWa Thanks Mark Recent poll indicated that 84% of republicans think discrimination toward white Americans is just as bad as discrimination toward people of color PPD should hit all the rioters with the classic frat who do you know here, bro?

Might need a fact check on that. But Danny McBride (who is a comedic genius) basically made Succession but instead of a media conglomerate the family business is a mega church That is actually a great fucking pojnt The ringer had a interesting article where they outlined how it was a family bloodline show like succession and one other on hbo Hows Adam Devines character? lol really? link me Hes actually not as annoying as you would anticipate But very similar to his other roles for sure Guy doesnt have many layers Im not a big fan of his work in general but I actually like his character in this show ^+1 https://www.theringer.com/tv/2019/8/16/20807799/righteous-gemstones-review-danny-mcbride Im currently running through season two of Mindhunter Yeah Im 4-5 eps into mind hunter as well mark Great stuff Season two is good, in a different way Less linear narrative Adam plays the role perfectly with his look at least lol - I only watched the first half tho Goodman had gastric bypass Gemstones premeire was great I thought Damn dux opening at 11 in the ap Dude The pac commissioner is an idiot Saying he wants early kickoffs Fine if its Utah or Colorado maybe Arizona but Im not going to a game at 9am at authentic Autzen* Thatll be weird for sure Just got our Airbnb for UW game Also got USC tix too Gonna go to more road games than home this year Going to Dallas and asu maybe uw Late games a huge part for the pac advantage Debatable but who on the east coast really cares about Pac-12 anyway The answer is no one Ill admit tho doing early games would change that Just need uw Oregon Stanford and usc to stay relevant and get the prime time abc game on a fairly consistent basis Pac12 after dark is a real thing now tho I dont really value national attention Contender will get in the playoff anyway Meanwhile they are kicking every other conference in the ass at home Youre right Brock Its more the vanity of it Larry is all about that I dont know also how much this matters but young recruits on the east coast getting to see games would also be nice Guys from the SE who may have never seen a Pac 12 game or barely sees them in comparison to their daily SEC stuff Im pro #Pac12AfterDark He screwed us over in college the way he scheduled our biggest games like Stanford and usc deep in season just to get the PrimeTime game The south thinks west coast football is weak regardless Recruits arent watching full games. Theyre watching highlights, talking to coaches/players And going to official visits every week Larry Scott is a fucking ?? Hes burning cash like he was running a tech startup I was baiting dubov to come in like this all along Headquarters should be in Scottsdale It should be literally anywhere besides SF Asu has good broadcast school for network use Larry thinks hes running a media company rather than an athletic conference The problem is his media company sucks Hulu has all love sports but Pac-12 LA is the TV capital of the world At least of the west coast Its not that hard Garrapolo. 0-4 2 batted balls and a pick Wtf Threw 5 straight picks in practice last week 5 passes 5 picks Is that bad? Petermanesque He sucks Ive said this for three years now Jimmy G is not good and the people who think he is have not watched him Bring on the over reactions!

Their consistent tv schedule on major networks gives it a shot tho I just remember younger me thinking the football sucked It also didnt help it tried to compete with the NFL that time It got tommy Maddox the starting qb job for Steelers but ya overall it was weak. If it sticks around for a couple years it will be interesting to see if college players take a stab at it before going to nfl draft These team names are so bad lol Always so conservative. I guess Im riding with the Houston Roughnecks since I appreciate the homage to the old Oilers logo Plus they have June Junes as head coach. *Jones Chris Miller is their oc too I sat behind him at duck games and he would flick bottle caps on the field from 30 rows up Just got a cold call email from a production agency seeking new business.

Noah > Howard and its not even close Gundy would have so many things to write about like LeBron invites entire team over for taco Tuesday. Forgets Dwight. And LeBron murders Dwight in cold blood for throwing bad outlet pass Also Mo Speights and the piece of shoe leather on his head is the ?? Im def hitting my traffic bonuses if LeBron kills Dwight Wow Matt, its comments like this that confirm my theory that the JCSL could be a 9 figure Marketing/Ad firm The best idea Ive ever heard in this group was when Brock suggested the nba/WNBA jersey swap Everyone would eat that up And all the ad people would get big contracts Honestly Dubov you should pitch it for Nike Do they have all the WNBA i is too? Yeah its a package dea *deal Could you imagine if LeBron had a LeBron LA Sparks un? Slay my woke king! Earned media would be BOOMIN Yeah its a banger That would be dope Youre also the only company that can do it I have no idea who I would even talk to about that You have all the jerseys But its a fantastic idea Adam Silver would be into it Yeah its a huge win for everybody The only issue I could ever see arising is having like Derrick rose in a WNBA jersey But I dont think that would be an issue LeBron in a Los Sparks jersey on Taco Tuesday Is there anybody at wieden you work with? Hire Brock as a freelancer lol so he can win a bunch of ad awards and then go back to doing science Bro I actively avoid any conversations with WK https://twitter.com/karlbuscheck/status/1164935335496695808?s=12 move to SF, still use Oakland marks lmao Can u imagine if the thunder had the space Needle at center Court lol Yea thats pretty tough Should have done The City and had the skyline in the center or the bridge There are three more in there including The City Four court options Including San Francisco Warriors lol The SF Warriors one is a kick to the nuts Golden State didnt need to be fucked with its the whole fuckin state Anyone tag Turner yet? It used to be the SF Warriors, I thought they changed the name to golden state I may be completely wrong here https://twitter.com/corbinasmith/status/1164920692787122177?s=21 Oh shit you right you right.

I know Im jp Totally But I dont really eat fast food and Olive Garden is trash I just mean in general its been on my mind Like we gotta fucking get over it. Eat your McDonalds Im boycotting soul cycle How many of these donated to the Democratic Party Surprised Taco Bell would back him even after he said the best taco bowls come from trump tower Have some conviction Jesus Christ Most of these are done in the name of lobbying and they love to play both sides He also deported their chihuahua That said Chic-Fil-A is some hatful ass chicken.

All hail Popeyes chicken sandwich (spicy) I dunno guys I kinda dig the taste of hatred and ignorance I only care for the waffle fries and lemonade The chik fil a breakfast biscuit with a packet of Texas Pete >>> Although I am gonna try and get the Popeyes sandwich today Ok if were talking breakfast biscuits thats a completely different conversation The honey butter chicken biscuit at whataburger is the undisputed champion My office is connected to pine state biscuits I have never been to whataburger Whataburger burgers are forgettable but the breakfast is good Wow inn out Thats hurtful The bag it comes in has more flavor than the burger anyway Best burger (fast food) is burgerville tillamook cheese burger. Ohh I really miss those Lol in n out prints bible verses on its packaging so yeah, it makes sense theyre donating to trump Never knew this Dubov Yeah man theyre some burger slangin bible thumpers Their entire vibe is trying to recreate the 50s so this is not surprising to me I had no idea about the Bible quotes Maybe thats why their burgers are so cheap... alterer motive Houman thats such a trash take that burger is also WAY too expensive The small cheeseburgers are the bomb tho. Good simple burger. Two smalls with a fry is the go-to order at bVille for me now I think that costs 6o9 too A nice deal Burgerville fucks. I also get enjoyment out of telling Californians that its better than In N Out. Watching them experience an aneurism in real time is fun. Im such an in n out homer Also superdeluxe is my favorite right now Hands down Love super deluxe Oh super deluxe is nice Super deluxe breakfast should be illegal Fries are great and their house made dipping sauces are killer I like lunch more than break, but break is also unfair Getting an almond milk latte with a BEC and hash browns is fucking insane They actually have a good chicken sandwich Thats the one thing I havent had but I always get nuggets and those are fire Two things, first Burgerville is canceled for putting cold cheese on a burger. Thats weird 2 did you know that Texas Petes is made in Winston Salem, North Carolina? Learn something new everyday Wow I had no idea that Texas Pete wasnt actually from Texas Currently waiting in a line at the Popeyes drive through This shit is real Fun fact: if somebody uses the phrase snackable content in a deck I stop reading a close keynote. Whenever they say that on a USA Today conference call is when I load a bowl while keeping the call on mute Alright that sandwich fucks In n out is better as far as price. But burgerville for 5-6 bucks more has a better burger Cold cheese! Its weird! Dammit mark you may have just ruined burgerville forever for me Yeah cold cheese is odd Their milkshakes though are fucking dank dont @ me Chocolate hazelnut shake is money Milkshakes are supposed to be cold, Cam Also the only good fast food fish and chips in the game Milkshakes are supposed to be concrete @spaceman you picking UCLA for the natty this year again? ? Dwight!!!! The Lakers!!!! We did it!!!!!! ? Bahahah ? 10-Oct Wut. Yeah can someone unpack this for me? I do concede the point that no one is too controversial to have an atleisure line cant argue with that logic Tami isnt wrong about that Mark My favorite is the idea that anybody has ever told her to stick to politics lmao ?? College bets I just laid Lmao you built a model didnt you Pitt over 6?! What?! ?Here was last years results. Went larger The algorithm says so, you trust your gut or you trust science!!! What is the Oregon State over? 2.5 Thats a tough one Brock Im gonna tail your bets but only the ones that are winners Can we do college weekly pick challenge? The lakers had javale interview Dwight to see if the lakers could trust him Rengel I would participate I like the season long rankings challenge We vote on 3-5 games to pick each week Pick 8 teams:
1-5 (1)
6-10 (1)
11-15 (1)
16-20 (1)
21-25 (1)
Unranked (3)

You get in the inverse of points of whatever their ranking is x 3. #1 ranked gets 75 pts, #2 gets 72, #25 gets 3. Plus one point for every spot they moved from start of season. Unranked are considered #26. That sounds fun Also know this will trigger some but until the Oregon line went from 9 to 8.5 that was on the under list. Booo ? Brock you have Pitt, Wake, and BC all over 6. Theyre the shittiest teams in the conference there is no way they all are bowl eligible. Im not trying to win a contest Im trying to be 2-1 also Many of those are picked as floor is 6 so why not pick over The man is a scientist and a software engineer Dont argue with the big ?? Lol I invite public commentary Think this list could certainly improve through a human review process I guess 2-1 is like highly successful overall If I was in a picks contest that would be a butt entry I agree ?God look at these clowns ? Carr would never do that hes too much of a pussy Listening to Trump talk about his favorite bible verses is like hearing Houman talk about his favorite sexual positions https://twitter.com/tylerhuckabee/status/1164607230416740352?s=12 This video has been circulating today but its from a while ago.

But football wise I'm a big fan But these things AB is going is related to football Odell has never done anything to affect his ability to play on sundays 2 diff things AB missed four flights in one day last year that we booked for him to come to an event he was contractually obligated to be at He was just too busy BOOMIN An event for kids no less AB is a fucking idiot Odell is also just a diva lol This helmet thing is the dumbest shit I've ever heard But hes not as dumb as AB That for sure I will agree with you, chad. OBJ hasnt ever done anything to jeopardize his on field performance I agree chad but I think Odells trip to Miami before playoff game was poor judgement I think one time he might have kicked something on the sideline? But that was minor He did lose his mind against Josh Norman that one time Fair Rengel. But all in all he's balled out and most of his teammates seem to like him And most of his antics have just been passion to win baby. AB is acting like someone on drugs Hes like the giving tree of football offseason storylines tho AB 100% has CTE Do you concur, Dr. Mirtorabi? Yeah football preseason woulda been way more boring without this He for sure has CtE or hes just always this egotistical The two brains are merging ?

They said it's called mulch Is it not called mulch? Mulch is like potting soil I thought mulch first tho lol Bark dust is the small chips from bark And bark chips are the bigger version they had on playgrounds Am I crazy lol We used manure sometimes In the flowerbeds Manure is in the same family as mulch Can farmer Dylan weigh in Its definitely Mulch. I have a bag of it in my garage that says Mulch I went to a concert with my brother earlier, the artist is called mitski (really great!) but after we went to a bar. I said to my brother man mitski is amazing the waitress in earshot turned around and said wait what did you just say!? I said uh the artist mitski is amazing? She cracked up and said so sorry I thought you said something else and walked away laughing ? What do you think she thought I said Ive been on this for an hour and the best Ive got is those titties are amazing! ? Well were her tits amazing? She was pretty yes Alex Nice Not like busty Got any photos ? How would that help get to the bottom of this!? How do u pronounce mitsky phonetically Mitt (baseball glove) ski (winter sport) Man meat is amazing ? Man her tits are amazing I just feel like It would have to have been really bad For her to be like Im excuse me To a private conversation Mitch Trubisky is amazing Man clit pee is amazing ? Its a movement I honestly wouldnt be surprised if shoreside was an all star! Yes!!!! 3 Blazers All-Stars! 55 wins! Hes still got it! Remember last year in Portland? I would pay to watch him and Nurkic in practice when Nurk is healthy Nurkic was healthy that game? Yeah it was before the break I mean barkdust is a type of mulch Youre both right The expert has spoken And you did pay to watch it? Im confused There we have it Yes fuck you lol We still made the playoffs ?? Who wants to take Chiefs -4 tomorrow??? Stop shitting on your own player lol Against the motherfucking Jags This isnt me deal any more Anymore* Im not shitting on Whiteside He balled He also balled at MSG Im just saying him
And Nurk in practice would be elite Nobody has a better center rotation Yeah Nah my b I misread that Watching him and nurk scrimmage would legitimately be fun Boys we got a 10:30 Pac 12 kick Washington-Cal Lmao Lol sort of a fun fact that Nurkic got six assists that game Nurk is an underrated passer Nurkic is one of few guys in nba history to have a 5 x 5 Olajuwon is like the only center Other than him He played the plumee pick n roll downhill dish to the corner man better than Plumlee did Other guys are like Andrei Kirilenko Batum Batum when he had his one good game Yes! Ak47 was dope His was so Batumy too Like 6x8x5x7x5 I can't believe Batum swindled MJ outta 125 mil Guy will take 3 shots in a game Batum had 11 points, 10 assists, 5 rebounds, 5 blocks, and 5 steals. Legendary batum game Also I want to submit Colts +250 tomorrow at Chargers to the upset coalition Jacoby can sling it and the Chargers d is gonna be toast At least 6.5 is a lock imo I'd do it Philip rivers arm could fall off at any moment I locked it in Colts and Jags tomorrow Big dog plays All dogs tomorrow 1-0 atm Wait I want chiefs -4? Yes Mark 10? Im all in on my Jags Taking all dogs but Broncos Rams and Bills are my locks Oooh I like the Bills too I think darnold will be better this year but jets getting too much hype Bills defense is also very strong Their secondary is really good I have way too much josh allen stock. May be my fantasy downfall Bahahaha I just saw the Huskies score #Pac12AfterDark I love the eagles vs redskins Josh Allen, the 50% passer? Josh Allen the runner lol Josh Allen aka Todd Heap at QB Todd Heap would be a good BACKUP QB he could run over defenses Yikes ?? ?? ?? Welp Fucking a Jags Jalen Ramsey started talking cash shit and just got burned Meanwhile Josh Allen is slinging it! I jinxed him lol Josh Allen started 4/4 and just had back to back turnovers Last one wasnt his fault Just woke up, 10 works Gunde unless you want more Nah lets do 10 Chiefs started up 10-0 lmao Def forgot how much I hate commercials Sammy Watkins ballin out I know this is nuts Chiefs are back! They never left! Chiefs pats afc finals gonna be sick Guy who picked Mohomes round 1 in my league isn't looking too crazy atm Marcus > Mayfield No one told me to play Sammy Watkins :Week 1 overreaction number 37 Greg the leg 49 yard doink! Love it Honestly Cleveland losing today would be #peak The muni lot would burn Highest expectations only to get dropped by the titans Also I took a flyer on Dede Westbrook a couple rounds early and Nick Foles just destroyed his shoulder Could be worse! I started Dede Today Oh yea hes my flex I dont pick guys I've never heard of.

Get a better shot at the guys no one saw coming lSince realignment in 2002, 98 of the 144 playoff teams won their season opener. But 46 teams made the playoffs after losing their season opener. Gonna go with no on that Sammy Watkins got those good steroids In fantasy Prob He upped his speed rating by like 3 points Thats why real fantasy leagues use FAAB If you were down by 1 with minimal time left on your own one yardline, could it be a big brain to purposefully safety so you can get some better field position and try to tie with a long fg? I think thats too big brain Oops you have to punt it Now thats just dumass brain Lol Lol I loved following that out loud thought Does nfl reddit still work? What's the streaming situation these days Yes I just left my house and can't steam red zone unless I'm on in home WiFi Fucking bull shit Yup.

Great timing by the Celtics lmao Since they let America down and all Freedom fries 2.0 I didnt really like the Rodman film, Rengel. I thought there were some interesting points but it felt like they stretched a 45 minute story into two hours. I loved the animated 30 for 30 short from a few years ago though. Idk I thought it was pretty good but I was a huge bulls fans so maybe that had to do with it. It was interesting learning more about his upbringing and early nba career too but otherwise I felt a lot wasnt groundbreaking John salley and the espn journalist added some good commentary - also its kinda a preview of how the bulls doc will be Its so obvious Salley hates him lol. I was really surprised they got Jordan, though. Didnt expect that. I think my issues were less with the narrative and more with how it was made.

Lol I love the nba Like jimmy Butler is just my fav player now I actually agree with that top 10 Are we sure Russ is a top 20 player? ?? I think kawhi should be 1 until proven otherwise But yeah I mean, yeah. I would agree with that. I guess I mean I agree with the 10 players selected. I think he's still top 20. Who would you have bump him out Dubov? Beal? Mitchell? Definitely Beal. Mitchell not yet, but soon. I can't believe LA is still 16. Would love to see this team with him still at the 4 Yeah I'm really interested to see this Harden/Russ combo. Two highest usage guys in the league and Russ can't shoot. Are they really gonna take Harden off the ball? admittedly I havent watched many spurs games, but I feel like I significantly undervalue LA. is he really that good still? he was an all-star, yeah? It's a fair point. I feel like Blake is better than him for sure but apparently he's better than we thought Bring him back next summer for the love of god I mean I think we can all agree that he benefits from being on Derrick Whites team. LA has always been quiet and efficient. Even when he was on the blazers you would feel like he was having a bad game and he would have 26 and 10 Still hate him though All will be forgiven when he returns next summer and plays 3rd fiddle to dame and Cj leading us to a championship Cant wait for him to sign with Portland next summer and cam to immediately forgive him and get his jersey lol I will never forgive him for what he did but I would feel better watching him crawl back to the team he abandoned pleading for mercy A championship would be tight too I think LA is also even better defensively now Even tho hes old Hes just so savvy The spurs offense also got him a lot of easier shots https://twitter.com/BernieSanders/status/1172196927087112192?s=20 Bernie talkin SPICY today https://twitter.com/means_tv/status/1172111510761590786?s=21 ?Multi-cultural management specialist! https://twitter.com/trailblazers/status/1172202306554609664?s=21 omg Im in my emotions right now https://twitter.com/thenbacentral/status/1172235437643051011?s=21 This cannot be real Get hyped Ian!

Oh fuck thats right NFC West also looks great with three 2-0 teams AFC North and NFC South look way worse than everyone thought Will you take the packers seriously after they beat a real qb in joe Flacco?

Stay tuned http://vm.tiktok.com/DKFQA9/ me every Sunday Random thought I just had following FIBA, how much has Marc caught up to Pau in overall legacy over last 4-5 seasons? ?? Pau then Marc Yeah I think Pau still takes it But they have a real argument for the best brother tandem ever Both of them are Hall of Fame for sure now 17/9.2/3.2 vs 15/7.7/3.4 Interesting that Marc has a first team and Pau doesnt Pau was at his peak when there were more dominant big men Yeah and Pau was overshadowed by Kobe The Kobe machine was just never gonna let it so Pau would get his just die *due Ok but like Pau is gonna have 3x the chips by the end of this season so I dont think its even close at that point YeH it was all about who Kobe won without (Shaq) rather than who he won with Not to mention Pau beats him in virtually all stat categories Fun fact theyve both played exactly 33.4 mpg Marc also not playing 400 more nba games Im betting Marc has him in assists and steals but assists just barely Pau has ppg, Rebs, blocks I also may be biased cause I saw Marc more in his prime but I think Marc was a better defender Pau has FG% , Marc has FT% and 3PT% I hope Pau takes Hassan under his wing That trope almost never actually happens but we can dream Nvm Pau has 3PT% I was looking at this season Need some 3 amigos shit with Pau Hassan and Nurk I just saw a billboard that said create book dealers not drug dealers the fuck is a book dealer Trump on the death of Cokie Roberts: She never treated me nicely.

I kinda do I think that's a bit over zealous Kawhi also only signed for two years so I'd be surprised if they won 2 ships in the next 4 years Yeah but hes an LA guy Ad clips are well managed I dont think it is man, kawhi has been dominant for years now And now he has pg Maybe just because theres a lot of good teams this year They are the betting favorites Yeah Also doc is a great defensive coach Other than Portland I think Im leaning towards betting on golden state And he has two of the best wing defenders of his generation now I think For your money GS is a great bet Has he been dominant for years? He missed an entire season two years ago Yeah but every year hes been healthy He's had two seasons of alpha play averaging 25+ Hes a pretty sizable fluke from having 3 finals mvps All the others he was a lock down wing averaging 16 Pg will prob average more points no? God its too bad PG is gonna be out for like the first month of the season for them but good for Portland lol I think we play the clippers two times pretty early We play them early November and December So may be a 50/50 with PG Have a feeling he is gonna play us VERY hard after playoffs last year ?

Pelosi announcing a formal impeachment inquiry. Dont think the Dems in Disarray have the cajones to take this anywhere but ???? Is it actually better for Dems to not run against him ? Its better for humanity to not run against him I believe so - as long as it doesnt get us stuck with pence somehow But I dont think this inquiry will go anywhere because the Dems are pussies and are more worried about their political futures than whats good for their constituents ?

Team USA! Dude he's making the all star game for sure! Book it Man no respect for jimmy b Im gonna be the pessimist and say I dont see an ASG selection in his future But I do think he makes a serious jump Basically it all depends on the blazers record around December/January So like 49-1? I wanna see CJ and Dame both average 25 Hahaha I mean if we are top 2-3 in the west they have a real shot at getting 2 guys Sorry space. It's the blazers time The coaches reward winning and they pick the respetes *reserves I honestly think this is the easiest year for him to get it. Derozan taking a step back. No Klay. Mitchell hasn't arrived yet. Booker is on a 20 win team. Conley is old If Booker makes an all star appearance i will do something drastic Agreed Lol chad What specifically does The blazers time Entail? Lol it means we're way better than the heat and my shit talking and homerism is going to another level this year Honestly I think we could see 3 first timers in the west.

As long as it's consistent across players Stein said they are going no shoes RIP to six foot Chris Paul and 7-foot Dwight I know. I'm just saying that's kind dumb Dame is 6'3 on the court But for the record dame is 6'1 and 3/4 without shoes and CJ is 6'2 1/4 according to draft measurements They cant account for shoe size tho That would be an organizational nightmare Cause every shoe is different This definitely has to do with gambling and shit Yeah but all shoes gotta be within a half inch of each other Nobody is wearing platforms lol A basketball shoe is a basketball shoe I wonder how many sub 6' guys this will add to the list Caruso memes give me life https://twitter.com/showtimeforum/status/1177273053098627072?s=21 Cause we need more content chad That shit looks like he injected his arms with animal fat That is probably what Sam Jacobs is striving to look like ??

I dont think he deserves to be just interesting considering he was mvp contender a few seasons ago I think its fair Or won it? (Cant remember) Hes great at everything but hes so bad at shooting he sabotages it all He won in 2017 Gotcha gotcha, quite the fall off Look at his free throw percentages when you get the chance Its in his head for sure Yeah I think it's absolutely fair. There's nobody in front of him worth bumping back You see that theory that he isnt allowed to walk back to the three point line anymore between free throws Which used to be his routine Dame is having his Drexler moment. He's clearly the 2nd best pg in the league now and will be a HOFer. But he just happens to be playing at the same time as an all time great at his position Oh thats right! I forgot about the free throw rule change Sounds like good ol Coke sesh to me https://twitter.com/nypost_lewis/status/1177603500496363521?s=21 Ok we both know they were talking conspiracy theories and something about the world being a simulation at 4:15 am ?

Championship SZN begins at 11:45 Just banked some #content with Brooks Koepka. Dude nailed it first take. Fucking pro. Oh fuck me! Gonna be jizzing my pants from content today Clear my schedule Diane! Alex u could do some meta content about how the shoot was like 10 min away and Brooks wasnt there yet and then he shows up and kills it in 1 take The brooks stuff wont be out until spring but we got him in the lab all suited up in motion capture just fucking ripping tee shots into one of those screens Omg lol They kicked out burfict for the season Fuck that guy Greeny was saying he should be banned for life lol I mean at this point.... Not sure this man will change his ways Yah ban him what did he do https://deadspin.com/vontaze-burfict-ejected-for-particularly-heinous-late-h-1838596827 If I remember right he wanted to go to Oregon but Chip turned him down pretty standard for him Lol comment Hey, if theres one thing you cant criticize Donald Trump for, its leading with his head. I saw a comment defending him saying Doyle lowered his head. Lol he was on his knees falling backward In high school Burfict would stand over guys he just tackled and scream in their face. Hes one of those guys who thinks playing a football game is equivalent to actually being in a war https://twitter.com/fieldyates/status/1178702275814002689?s=21 U man no one has ever deserved the benefit of the doubt less https://twitter.com/redapples/status/1178649589311774721?s=21 Damn MacKenly has a 3 vertical too?

Its just nice not having two dudes teams will just leave On offense Oh I agree with that whole heartedly Teams will have to guard the whole floor against us now you know how much I love defense but the NBA is an offense league Why do you think I love big 10 basketball so much lol Gotta get my fix of floor slapping, charge taking, help side rotating defense Yeah they're getting buckets anyway but it's nice to have a 6'8 guy to throw at them on the perimeter Dubov maybe youll jump on the philly bandwagon this year then Theyre gonna take basketball back a decade Also Moe would guard point guards when we needed him Shit sign me up for that Gundy Aminu I will not miss one bit. He couldn't even get on the floor in the playoffs God I love defense Brett Brown did what no coach ever does and said they will run less Ah see thats where he and I differ Great defense gives you the opportunity to run more The fewer offensive sets the better Simmons is the only transition offense they need But theyre so big https://twitter.com/radrivas/status/1178426220880355329?s=21 Lmaooo Jeezy is launching a sports agency Also, is he no longer Young Jeezy?

What the fuck Also of all the CJ step backs they picked a brick? Lol yeah I thought that was odd too The only clear violation i see is monty mccutchens wardrobe decisions I cant wait for all of the travels they call in the first week of the season and for that to dominate sports talk shows Harden traveling 7 times a game is gonna be great People are gonna lose their fucking minds The NBA has gone too far! Even though its exactly what people have been asking for. This is unwatchable! Haha true. But it is exactly what everyone has been asking for so we'll see I just watch the nba until big 3 offseason is over Itll be like when they expanded video replay. We want replay! They need to get the calls right! Led to Its taking too long! Its disrupting the flow of the game! I'm sure ESPN will embrace the debate Fans are stupid.

Bernie $25.3 million
Buttigieg $19 million
Harris $11.6 million 
Yang $10 million
Booker $6 million
Bennett $2.2 million

Warren and Biden yet to report Trump also yet to report but I get the sense it will be big Bern dog Millionaire! Most donors and most money??? Who would have though T Shoutout to the yang gang tho All his hoop mixtapes are paying off GOP raised $125M Tom Steyer buying his way into the next debate is so fucking dumb Damn Bernie had chest pains Shocked by how much money he raised Chest pains is a wild undersell lol He got two stents put in for an arterial blockage Bernie hasnt been resting his Cheerios Im pretty sure Bernie survives on a steady diet of Ensure shakes and three grapes Lol this chick on the herd just said Russell Wilson is a first ballot HOFer I mean he probably will be Thats not that crazy Russ is really fucking good, and I hate him and the Hawks Scary if ziggy and clowney start performing I guess I just hate when people say that stuff so prematurely. Cuz you're assuming he keeps this up for another 6 years with that statement yeah? If his career ended today he's not a HOFer Lol Russell is def a hall of gamer Famer So joe Flacco is too? Russ has made the playoffs every year since a hes been in the league except one, two super bowl appearances (one win), never had a losing record Lol Wilson is not Flacco lol He's got 26,000 passing yards and one ring You can't tell me that's a HOF resume right now lol Right but if his career ended today that would be taken into account lol Ive never heard Russel Wilson and Elite used in the same sentence once.. I'm not buying that lol if his career ended today he's not going in the hall Ok well then we probably shouldnt say that about practically anybody If youre say precluding a massive injury or something Also man Russell hasnt exactly been gifted great o lines or receivers Hes def a hall of famer I just feel like he should be farther down the road in his career to say that. He's basically half way thru. Too many variables to make that claim He didnt have a great line or receivers is not an argument to put somebody in the HOF compare him to his peers Its not at all Theres no one in competaition But hes theres without that Nah hes way more than halfway through When he will be eligible he will smoke all competition i think too many guys get into the HOF in general Yeah this is dumb, I get why youd hate Russel, but come on Russell has been consistently great for like 7 years now If you havent heard Russ is elite Rengel its because this chat talks basketball too much Hes definitely Elite Plus hes like the nfls poster boy for conduct lol Thats not relevant to the HOF Lol it definitely is like it or not Also the NFL stats stuff for QBs is very jaded. Stafford has a billion yards but is he a HOFer? Conduct isnt something thats considered Oh come on Its the pro football HOF not the NFL HOF League conduct is irrelevant Yeah thats just not involved Sure! Stafford has the stats but not the winning percentage or success in the playoffs Russ wins, has a ring, and puts up stats and carries that team But you still need stats Russ stats are good enough Hes also insanely efficient Put him in the Childrens Hospital HOF where he belongs The HOF always screws over guys that gave the league trouble If he decided to retire right now sure its more of a conversation Its just recently became a thing for TO, who else tho? Not right now is all I'm saying lol. 6 years from now if he keeps this up then of course. I just don't like making the claim that he's a HOFer right now cuz it's not true yah again theres no one in his age range that will beat him out I needed a get off my lawn hill to die on this morning okay Russ is probably top 4 qb right now Rg3 and luck crashed (his draft class) Outside of the big 3 Here are the list of the 48 voters https://www.profootballhof.com/heroes-of-the-game/becoming-a-hall-of-famer/ Brady, Rodgers and Manning Stafford Flacco etc will not take his slot Stafford and Flacco are not hall of gamers Famers* What about Matt Ryan? He's got an MVP Matt Ryan is on track yes A Marino esque deal Yah but Russel beats Ryan Rivers is the same And cam newton Matt Ryans problem is sometimes he and his team suck serious ass for long periods of time Russel is better than Ryan The Seahawks are consistently competitive Carried by an all time D and elite run game early tho ?? Is marshawn HoF ? In the history of pro football, 26 QBs have made it into the HOF 26! Wow Dubov bringing receipts Qb hasnt even been as important as now Brady, Manning, and Rogers are for sure in. Were talking less than 30 dudes. Idk that Russ is one of them. So is Brees ?Steve Young, Kurt Warner, Bob Waterfield (?) also on the list Mark Brunell would have been a hof if he played today based on your guys standards Get Kurt Warner the fuck outta here more and more qbs will get in Youre right, Brock. But lets not open the flood gates here. The ducks have 2/26 pretty good Again, look through the dudes in Russells age range and no one else compares Hes the qb of his era Ray Guy is the only punter lol Mahomes the king of the next round That Oregon state dude on the rams will be the next! What about Ryan Allen First ballot? Johnny hekker thats his fucking name. Ian probably hates him because he went to Bothell Bothell > OSU > rams Ians nightmare Lol I used to pose as a deranged bothell fan on the SeattleTimes.com high school football forums and stir shit up Hahahaha I'm dying God I love high school football message boards lmaooo Especially back in the 2000s People would say anything I spent way too much time talking shit about other high schools players on oregonlive.com I got called out freshman year at end of practice for doing that Dehaan be honest did you read the message boards to see what people were saying about you No more posting on Oregon live.. Probably commented under the handle L0max$ux Pretty positive I just called Antwaan Randle Els brother Randle El used to be the man Ultimate end around pass threat Ya he was their next Kordel https://twitter.com/theonion/status/1179449730310557696?s=21 High Key Bern Dog almost died. Still voting for him fuck it Its gotta be Liz guys Give me the warren buttigeg ticket Yah why cant verniers just he minister of socialism on warrens ticket and get this shit over with ? (This text brought to you by Brocks +900 bovada bet on Elizabeth warren ) Bernie * Lizzie can and should fuck off And she should take her cunty if youre voting for bernie over Elizabeth youre sexist supporters with her (I do not endorse Bernie) Wow thats a take Ok who you gonna primary for? Undecided at the moment Kamala? Biden? You gotta have a preference! I honestly dont I just truly dislike Warren And Im all the way out on Biden Thats crazy shes the best candidate Biden is running because we need to beat trump. Thats not a policy. Agree with that Yeah! Im better because Im not that guy. is not gonna cut it for me Liz is made of policies Bidens gonna go down with the Ukraine stuff Kamala is a cop! Thats not her stance Dubov, obviously thats dumb Yah exactly Ian Im talking about bind *biden ahh Yeah I Misread that too Yes no one gets an award for not being trump Was glad I reread before shooting back lol Sorry yeah I switched gears on that one I just want to see butigeg go up against pence I dont like kamala that much but I actually think she could be a beast in the debates yah she could smoke trump so I wouldnt mind I got her at 36:1 2 years ago Still think Julian Castro could make a play but its prob too late now People that like Biden could jump on board The new slightly more left Obama Castro took a lot flack last debate and that kinda pushed him out We just really need to work hard to get Biden the fuck outta here Is Howard Schulz still in the race lol Republicans want Biden to win. Thats all that needs to be said They are pushing that for sure but it brought us an impeachment at least https://twitter.com/PodSaveAmerica/status/1179474984567070720?s=20 If somebody I worked with answered a question like this I would tell them to get the fuck out of my meeting Omg that was amazing haha "Are you talkin to me?!" He walked away with millions and he knows nothing is hilarious way to refer to hunter biden considering his two shitbag sons are literally the most worthless morons on the planet Anyone want to bet the wildcard game tonight? Haha very true Im leaning As Bernie (?? )
Warren (best candidate ??)
Biden (booo, also dementia)
Kamala (?????)
Yang (Tech Jabroni)
Buttigieg (not even close) ? I was pro Kamala until all the DA shit came out. Shes a classic political climber, literally the candidate who would continue all the current problems with the democratic corporate approach I think mayor Pete needs to be the VP on the dem ticket Yeah Kamala sucks. Fuckin narc Isnt Pete a freaking mayor? This isnt a Disney movie Are you saying hes not qualified? Would you say he is more or less qualified than the racist reality television character that currently occupies the office? If we gave Rudy Giuliani shit for running as the mayor of NYC. How are we going to let Pete slide as the mayor of... South Bend Indiana! I remember people giving Rudy Giuliani shit for being a total psychopath but I missed the mayor part to be completely honest. Indiana has two jackass red neck senators, Pete should go take a seat from them Same with Beto in Texas As vp I dont see an issue Bill de Blasio isnt getting shit for being a mayor, just for having dumb ideas. Hey Im all for taking Senate seats so we can get rid of Moscow Mitch I think Pete and Booker know they won't win and are gonna start angling for VP bids De Blasio is the personification of a non sequitur The senate is the most worthless institution we have as a nation I think him or booker should be vp if Warren gets the nom Chad and I are on same page haha Yea does booker have any dirt? I kinda like him, hes crazy who doesnt love crazy And look at Bookers political career, its where Pete should be in like 15 years I have no problem with mayors running for higher office. Theyre people who actually enact policies and have an understanding of what their constituents care about. And he's dating Rosario Dawson which gets him an extra point When was the last time your gave a fuck about what matters to you? *your senator Hes relatable to many diff demographics too My senator is kamala and she roasts trump its great Also a huge cop But we all have our duties Being a senator should automatically disqualify you from running for president. Its a clear indicator that youre out of touch with reality. ^In terms of pete We need Gavin newsome to run in 2028 and come out as a gay cokehead during the inauguration speech Thatd be PEAK California politics ?Your next Vice President He looks like a walmart greeter lol Bernie isnt gonna win. Warren/Booker ticket would be a zesty replacement Also how great is it that Gavin Newsomes ex wife is Donald trump jr's current girlfriend? So many story lines here They definitely wont push the far left platform though. I just want free college and healthcare And disarm the police Not too much to ask! That had to have been pre-vegan Booker Warren is gonna move so hard to the middle youll think shes a jimmy eat world song And immediately start cashing those big donor checks she refuses to accept How many times are we gonna hear about 1/1024th if she gets the nod No one cares but it will be pushed til Election Day I mean at least shes not resigned to it Right of Liz is a hell of a lot better than right of kamala or Biden Trump will roast liz in the debates and then she will win itll be great ?? PTI more like TMI Ill see my way out I dont think we can overstate this... Kamala is a fucking cop Her response to snl was funny tho I didnt see it Did Marianne respond to SNL or is she just on a different planet right now? https://twitter.com/kamalaharris/status/1178289966675304448?s=12 Lmao thats funny https://twitter.com/highkin/status/1179497596403892225?s=12 WERE FUCKED!

I reached out to Andrew with a question then this chick just asks me my own question back?

Wait If everyone is on the rams Ill take Seahawks -1.5 Who wants action With hof implications I think Russ and hawks get the w Goff is a HOFer too. If he keeps this up for the next 15 years Itll be interesting to see how the HOF decides on the old class of QBs Eli, Stafford, Rivers especially Eli first team or the HoF is a fraud No joe Flacco though Eli and Rivers are 100% in Eli beat Brady twice Big Ben is in too Eli Big Ben and Rivers all from the same draft too Rivers is no way in r u joking?? Eli is 50/50 I wouldnt Yea i dont see rivers 7/10 doesnt get you in the hall Zero chance Mike Vick If they dont put Mike Vick in the fucking HOF they should all have their media credentials revoked That ref is a fucking nerd Eli is definitely in Ben and Rivers too Rivers is def not in dude like 2 playoff wins Many many bad bad seasons Ben has 2 superbowls hes a maybe Brock are you high How is Eli 50/50 Ben is a maybe?!

Im pretty sure giants had a ton of injuries the first super bowl season so 9-7 isnt very fair Big Ben is 7th all time in wins. Rivers 9th all time. 

Ben 7th all time td passes. Rivers 6th all time Rivers and Ben are in for sure Will take anyone $20 rivers doesnt make it Come one cum all Eli is 8th all time td passes. 12th all time in wins Done Brock Sweet deal I think hes fringe too but will probably get in after awhile HOF throw Its time Seahawks bring these back every game ? ?

Anytime Yeee new participants love it. The Orlando magic are currently sporting a 42.5 OU ?? Brock you keep saying that and it makes me think you know something the rest of us dont know Yeah I agree Im just a major Orlando magic hater Give us the tea Brock! I ended up going to a blazers magic game like 6 years in a. Row during the Alfred Payton era and the games were so unwatchable Last year they finally went over but I refuse to believe they can win 43 games lol Yeah very fair I went to the magic game last year because Ashley went to Texas and loves Mo Bamba. The game sucked. Also with an OU of 24.5 why the fuck would love not want to come home? Cavs are GARB Beilein was on Woj pod. Solid interview. I just love that guy. Team is gonna be ass this year though Every year I have to suppress the urge to pick 10 east unders How many wins did the Blazers have in 2017-18 - asking for the Timberwolves... https://twitter.com/heibeipangzai/status/1180170615707164672?s=21 Why the napkins though? ?Cougar Liz coming in hot Im actually more attracted to her after yesterday I wonder what Beto and Castro raised How much money do you think Bernie will raise for a new heart?

The suns GM should just ask Sarver what he would do regarding every move. Then do the exact opposite They gave up 3 2nd round picks to get rid of him Ineptitude at its finest Ian did I use that word right? The Pacers should be pretty legit. Picked up Brogdan, McConnell, Lamb and Warren and just lost Bogdonavich and Tyreke right? And get Oladipo back Just depends what dipo can do I like the pacers God bill Simmons is gonna fucking go off on this TJ warren thing. He loves him. Speaking of mid sized midwestern cities Im fly out out to Detroit on Sunday I will never forgive myself for playing Wilson Chandler over TJ Warren in the Superliga semis Space if you move to Detroit youll just be a quick trip to Milwaukee whenever you want Lol Chicago in like an hour from Milwaukee Right but Milwaukee is where the #culture is Milwaukee is the unofficial capital of the Superliga I wanna listen to this Sonics podcast from The Ringer but I refuse to pay for Luminary.

Bill has always been a goof when it came to content access. The ringer is light years behind when it comes to YouTube, they always seem to go with Twitter when its a terrible medium for things that arent happening live The ringer YouTube only has 150k subscribers Still waiting for space to start streaming on twitch I fucking love Twitter but it is a much smaller and very niche user base Its the bill Simmons of the world lol Whens the last time you followed someone new on Twitter There video platform sucks Take the game of throne recap shows Ive added like 3 people in the last year Last week Brock But I also curate my following list pretty obsessively Unless you watch the 9pm est show and jump on Twitter its way too hard to find Dropping and adding constantly Im the exception not the rule My Twitter is equal parts MMA/Basketball/Culinary/Chapo Trap House Yeah I dont watch shit on Twitter but the information is all there Also every meme starts on Twitter first Its like a focus group lol https://twitter.com/dame_lillard/status/1180226637679349760?s=21 !!!! "Only dame you beat was 2000 and that was stoudamire" ?????? People are wayyyy too horny for Utah these days agree Them being on a higher tier than portland is mind boggling to me According to Zach Lowe Lol how does he have us as a borderline playoff team? Back to back 3 seeds and a trip to the WCF The Jazz haven't done shit yet. Nuggets should be ahead of them too Sucks you cant be a strongish playoff team like the Miami Heat Has it been exhausting becoming a Sturgill fan for the last 10 days? - Russillo to SVP Time for you to get in the Over Under @chad Pretty shitty article from Lowe tbh I don't understand his "will Klay ever return to form" take. The guy scores 60 without dribbling. He can literally stand there and shoot and be the same player He looked pretty good while his knee was torn lol ?Today at the White House ? Lotta people docking up on Utah that is for sure ?Kyrie rocking the goldilock mids I always wanted a pair of those Those pure money 4's are fire too ? ?The lows are dope too but they're so expensive the had a Dunks room at Nike DNA for a bit that I got to see. It was fucking incredible. Every sick dunk you could ever dream of.

That little girl... That little girl was her ? Guys if the jazz made it to the finals with Donovan Mitchell as their best player, you're gonna have to keep me away from sharp objects https://www.instagram.com/p/B3NlWOMgBYN/?igshid=jc0jtjefvkay Blazers were literally the last team posted by the nba account. The disrespect We are gonna ass rape the NBA this year. Pucker up buttercup! Indiana is gonna be good even without Dipo Brogdon/Warren/Lamb is a pretty good guard tandem in the East I cant believe we are just 18 days until opening night! ? NBA doesnt matter until January Its football season You're the Meyers Leonard of basketball fans hoomie This is the first season in 10 years thats not true houmie Maybe 20 Lmao Guys we are really gonna need Whiteside The Lakers are fucking massive The lakers are fucking pussies!!! Whiteside is the AD Stopper I mean just in terms of size they are a large team Same with Utah and Denver too Clippers not so much Dude utah fans r feeling themselves On social Think theyre winning it all Im so sick of them Ducks covering -20.5 Utah fans all hyped up on Red Bull. They needa chill But yeah the lakers are big af. We're gonna have string bean Rodney hood guarding lebron lmao Dude Hezonja I'm just saying in the starting line up. But Mario would be dope to throw at him Oh yeah Mario is a bench guy We're just gonna have to win games 121-118 Is Hood for sure starting at the 3? My bet right now is Bazemore That's what I thought at first. But then everyone on blazers edge kept saying hood Should we try and make BazeGod a thing? (Is it already?) Hood does better when he can take undersized twos onto the block. If he plays the 3 full time we lose that advantage He abused Harris and Murray Im down with it Yeah it makes most sense to me to have him as the 2 on the second unit Maybe we should text terry Never been a Dye guy Bruno Mars is bigger than this guy Damn. Needed to house that https://www.instagram.com/p/B3QgpgaBWoR/?igshid=3r5wg17sj0ra Chip getting his bell rung by the beavs Jesus Christ man What the fuck is our offense I havent. Even watching but sounds like our RB coach calls plays now.. About fucking time Thank fuck God Jordon Scott is so sick Our D is so fire. Thank fuck cause our offense is playing like poo. All time sucks QB rankings:

1. Marcus
2. Joey 
3. Kellen Clemens
4. Darron Thomas
5. Dennis Dixon (personally I like Dixon above DT)
6. Masoli (won bigger games than Herbert)
7. Herbert
8-9 Akili and Fouts, probably even more guys here. Graziani too. Guys Im here to tell you Herbert is just okay. Im tired of trying to sit here silently while he garners tons of love I hate to say that Im starting to feel this way Ive been feeling this way since last year Masoli makes that throw to Breeland in the end zone on 3rd down I just stayed quiet I didnt wanna seem like an ass but can we just come to terms with it now? Im more excited for Shough next year than I am for the rest of Herbert this year. I think weve got a great team, so so receivers, a so so QB and bad RBs. Our RBs are like a Trent Richardson NFL highlight No our rbs look like they belong at western Oregon Trent Richardson belonged in college as one of the best to do it honestly. Yeah he just ran into his blockers in the nfl Awful vision These guys we have just are not D1 RBs physically Yeah bitch!!!! Herbert will still have a better career than Luck Hes been not very good Chad thats a bad call Luck is more talented than most of the qbs in the nfl. Similar to Calvin Johnson for WRs. Cut too short Take care of the ball and this is over ? Smoked a 4.5 short rib plate ? ? Ducks win! ? Go ducks! ?Same plus go Zers Im disgusted with the result tonight But still I say ? Go ducks ? Sco fucking ducks boys Holy shit the huskies WRs are worst than the ducks Im betting Dylans farm on Oregon minus the points at UW Wow Tencent, the people who basically run all the sports tv in China, said they Arent gonna air rockets games anymore cause Daryl Morey tweeted support of the Hong Kong protestors Holy shit. That's chinas team! Yeah dude this is massive Wow Im reading people that bought one-team cable packages for the Rockets can now exchange their packages cause theyre not showing the Rockets in China This is crazy Trump is gonna shoehorn his way into this Wow Would Morey get fired over this? Did Morey just single handedly plummet the rockets value Fertitta gotta be heated People are saying that could happen He already denounced the tweet right afterward Also the NBA just added their first Chinese owner This is about to get real interesting What did he do? He said he supports the protestors in Hong Kong on Twitter Morey did ?4-team parlay for the day Big Dig

They have the link right there tho Buffstream.live redtube.com I found it! Going deep Refs suck in Pitt Unbelievable they didnt overturn that Jesus mariota getting no help. Kicker is 0/3 He went to Oregon hes used to that Did it get blocked? Welp Chase just handed the Raiders the game The bucs really let me down today Need ravens to take this in OT Texans cover and some Minshew driving baby QBs who actually are not good even though they smoked the dolphins: dak, lamar, phillip(?) Eh I still think Lamar is goodhe has growing pains but hes still super dynamic And can throw a great deep ball Man this fantasy week is insane Everybody is racking it up Im projected for 110 and its the second lowest in the league lol Having CMC in fantasy is the greatest luxury Philly D waiver wire pickup was clutch this week 35 points Ellen Degeneres and George Bush sitting together lol Both love pussy Just talking about some of the great pussy theyve seen in their day Phillip Rivers golden jacket game Just an incredibly terrible throw ?Got this in the air flying to Detroit Dak Hof? ?Growing https://twitter.com/nba/status/1181001199430098944?s=21 Moe Harkless is unstoppable !

Looked solid today He will be a Boban type Yeah definitely seems that way Pretty wild how easily he can clean up around the rim ? ?Guess I gotta drink 5 Budweisers ? Ian you are correct I just drank $10 worth of Rainier on tap https://twitter.com/yiqinfu/status/1181024883272114180?s=21 This ain't going away any time soon Lol I got an Uber, the drivers name is Jamal Turns out its an old Greek man Not what I was expecting! Fuck the NBA and fuck China. What did Morey do wrong? It's a $$$ play. NBA doesn't wanna jeopardize millions of dollars from Chinese fans and sponsorships What a terrible person telling Hong Kong to fight for its freedom. Guarantee none of the woke nba players will say anything either. Don't wanna hurt their shoe deals Damnit Klay ! We are deeply shocked by the erroneous comments Erroneous!! Lmao Youd think he tweeted lets nuke all the chinks But lebron will wear "equality" shoes Terrible looks for NBA. Fox News bout to have a hay day. Next on Tucker Carlson NBA sells out to communists Lol Morey did not do anything immoral But as an employee he potentially cost his company a billion dollars Fair enough fire him Let the blazers hire him Which I dunno, youd have to ask one of these liga sales guys, but I dont think youre supposed to do that Im sure Dubov respects the disruption Hell be the white kaep But its also sad that the NBA wont take a stand either but business is business I get it. Blazer Money Ball with Morey It's just ironic that the nba will take social stands when it's convenient. Like I get it's a business, and profits matter most. But they decided to come out against the North Carolina bathroom ban and change the all star game because of it Fucking snowflakes He should double down and say he stands with Crimea Reminds me of when Kevin arnoviz had Marbury on his podcast and was like since your such a star in china, does that make you think a lot about their lack of freedom etc. etc. starrybury was like oh no its fine Chinese people couldnt handle that level of freedom they dont even want it lol Honestly I think The Chinese government is the one humiliating themselves here Youre gonna van you countries favorite team because one employee opposed one aspect of your government Its only gonna then people against them The Chinese government has humiliated themselves for 70 years and look where they are? Lol I didnt know this thats intense! They dont give two shits Yeah they don't care at all lol censorship at its finest Also ironic how the NBA has had Kanter's back with Turkey censoring him. Because turkey isn't a strategic partner of the NBA Yup. This is great for the Monday talk shows Literally every single show will mention this across every news outlet I can't wait for Trump to weigh in on this. Ted Cruz already chastised the NBA for not standing up to China, but Trump supposedly promised President Xi that he'd stay silent on the HK protests, and Cruz didn't come at Trump to speak up. Lol funny how everyone gets bold when it doesn't affect their pocket book The last South Park was essentially about this - kinda crazy James Harden was in it haha We sure kiss their ass lol For a country that considers itself the preeminent world power ?God mario has me rock hard right now LeBron is totally gonna equality his way out of this I just want to know what lavar thinks Lavars silence can only mean that a BBB relaunch focused on the Chinese market is in the works You guys As you may or may not know Im a nike campus tour guide. I give a handful of tours a month to executive candidates, business partners, athletes, etc. Every Monday they send a list of upcoming tours for people to sign up for This mornings email has a tour request for an executive request.

People arent *LISTENING* How much are these shoes? $150? Can I give you $700 for them? But I could probably end up on his TikTok so that would be good for my clout. Wait, these shoes cost money? You know what? You dont need money follow your PASSION these shoes are my passion so these are just free My favorite clips are where he goes to garage sales and haggles for some hot wheels and then pulls up ebay and is like I paid $3 for all of these cars.

The guy really loves dictators Gundy what's your thoughts on Steve Kerr saying no comment to the China news GS has too big of a China following for him to fuck up Yeah just classic NBA Hes definitely ducking But hes the woke king whenever he talks about Drumpf Lol I dunno if you can trash on someone for saying no comment lol Maybe he just doesnt know enough about the issue to feel comfortably speaking publicly about it lol Fair enough A guy in this meeting has a shirt that says strategic business unit and Im confused why he has my nickname for my dong on his shirt Ian that's exactly what he said But seems like a cop out from the woke king Chinese censorship hitting The Athletic https://amp.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/des8nt/the_athletic_didnt_post_on_the_china_story_all/?__twitter_impression=true I know I just think he has like nothing to do again, and who honestly cares what Steve Kerr thinks about China Like I guess I feel know enough to say I support the honk Kong protesters but I definitely dont know enough to feel comfortable speaking publicly about the issue Youre a communist Ian we get it No lol but this is like one step from Dave Chappells someone get ja rule on the phone 911 joke I get what youre saying Tho Its just hard to know if this is actually censorship with Kerr Or just a legit no comment Tho I dunno theres a point to be had That any higher up in the nba rn Prob is at least now educating themselves on this So yeah, maybe feigning ignorance I dunno The censorship is more about The Athletics story about the situation. They were deleting comments on the story that called out the writer for basically taking Chinas side I mean if a famous figure feels comfortable criticizing his own government but is afraid of criticizing the Chinese governmentwhos your daddy? China is my daddy. China is all of our daddy. Waiting for the Uighur thing to pop into all of this as well It has been in a bunch of think pieces. I didnt even know until this week the NBA has a camp in Xinjiang (the Uighur majority region) Tune in next week when Kevin McHale tweets his support for the KKK This is actually really good https://stratechery.com/2019/the-china-cultural-clash/ Can you believe its only four short months to the Super(liga) Bowl of February 9th?

Tell me I'm crazy Im guessing the lines in this Oregon Lottery app are gonna be way juiced? Well if anyone is in Vegas bet on the blazers for me there lol Yeah but that must mean other lines will be similarly affected by regional biases The Oregon Lottery is super risk averse Which is a potentially exploitable phenomenon i mean they got rid of the kitty glitter slot machine that used to absolutely shit out money How are they gonna do personalized lines? Just base it on geo? All the tracking data they have on you They can use the betting data Correct They gonna mine my tweets and see I slurp dame Any demo Oh gundy just bought a files jersey?
 Audible laughter at my desk Chad People looked at me No they can just mine your betting patterns You have to have an account right? Happy to invite any of you to Landons betting site if you want it Support your local bookie Im tempted but its a slippery slope Ask him how much to purchase his business off of him $250 free play when you sign up Well Thats interesting Does he accept BTC Minimum $25 bets ^ these are the important questions Nah fam. Venmo or PayPal only. Ok Venmos on Monday Good to know Anything +/- $200 for the week can be rolled over to next week if you want He has a website Dubov? He uses allgames365 He didnt build it But its great Oh and all the lines are -107 So $27 to win $25 is the minimum bet on spread. Juice changes for ML and O/U How much to open one of these sites Lmao seems like mark is already this guy No deposit. You get up to $5000 on credit every week And then either Venmo pay or receive Whoa Im not sure, but I think Landon just gets a cut of the losses. Its not his empire.

Its a clear majority can do that John Oliver putting Stephen A on blast tonight Whats he saying I just watched the succession finale careful Im like 4 eps behind Burning him for being Stephen A but also for what hes been saying about the NBA China sich. He essentially said that he doesnt support what Morey said because the NBA is going to lose a lot of money because of it. Essentially came off like he is in support of the Chinese government suppressing Hong Kong citizens because of the amount of money they have. John obviously said it much more eloquently but worth a watch. Succession was fucking incredible Ive never felt a stronger connection to a character than when cousin Gregory was laying on the back of the yacht drinking outrageously expensive ros saying I mean, Ill drink it. But its not my first choice. Can you Not be selfish and give any details about the finale!? lol that has absolutely nothing to do with the story But also the fact that you didnt watch the finale last night tells me all I need to know I also watched El Camino yesterday but I will refrain from speaking on that as well other than saying if you love Breaking Bad then what the fuck you gotta watch it I was planning on watching it last night but I was way too tired to commit to 2 hours. I watched the 3 minute recap and I realized how much I had forgotten about what happened in the show If anybody needs new headphones Ive got a 30% discount on sennheiser shit Putting in an order this week If anybody needs some good shit to listen to while working https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5ZhKyOxZns I can tell this chill mix is the only thing keeping Dubov from ripping the head off the next marketing douche who sicks his head in his cube Yea I had to put my headphones on. The ladies in the cube next to me were #TalkinHawks and I dont care about the #HawksTalk MVP chatter? HOF talk??? Mostly I skipped church and made brunch at home with my mom and the Seahawks almost blew it chatter This is a good mix tho I wouldve paid a lot of Czech crowns to be on that boat Hozier never skips church Stephen As response to John Oliver : bring back the baby filter https://twitter.com/stephenasmith/status/1183746505615822849?s=21 Damn this forth worth police shooting is wild Yeah dude its fucked up That cop is going to jail too and hopefully longer than 10 years Theyre trying to spin it so hard The police chief right now is coming pretty hard at the officer.

This seems like highway robbery Facebook video has always and will always be complete trash I can't believe they totally fabricated metrics and just got a tiny fine for it lol If companies switched their entire strategy to video because of facebook then maybe they should be firing their entire marketing department for it Because thats a terrible decision Sanders/Zuckerburg 2020 I hate videos I always support firing marketers Gotta follow the numbers man. I don't blame them yeah Anything longer than 10 secs of a guy getting nailed in the dong miss me Marketers are also dumb dumbs Gotta follow the numbers is a solid strategy if youre looking to expand into new content verticals But if youre going to completely flip what you do on the basis of what the platform is telling you youre a complete fool Every platform fudges the numbers Yeah I mean I always feel like companies put too much weigh behind media strategy The reality is that those marketing teams are/were building strategies and content based on what the PLATFORMS wanted them to do rather than what their CONSUMERS want Yeah shout out to all of the media companies who fired their staffs for the pivot to Facebook video we all told them was bullshit If you look at any of the stuff that was drove any kind of earned media (kapernick/dilly dilly) the medium didnt really matter investing in media is critical. If you cant distribute your content it doesnt matter how good it is. Hyper targeted ad serving is pretty useless if the ad itself it total garbage But you have to be disciplined in how you do it Nike as a marketing company suffers from absolutely horrendous media strategy We make all kinds of great content. Dont put it in front of the right people at the right time. Also everybody sleeps on out of home/billboard/print Ian loves traditional media Which is really silly because those are the only ads anybody like voluntarily consumes I read every subway ad Bc Im very bored on the subway Have you thought about mailing it to people direct, remember AOL had that ?? strategy of hitting people with the CDs Its not that I believe in traditional media its just that a video is still a video and poster is still a poster regardless of where you stick it You should get some AirPods, dude. Might make your subway rides more enjoyable. Yeah unfortunately every media company made the same decision regarding Facebook because they believed the metrics Only people that suffered were actual journalists like I said, believing what facebook tells you at face value is a fireable offense imo Now that we live in a post 2016 world we realize that but I dont think people were as suspicious as they should have been before At least the bosses werent Yeah Im kinda with Dubov here Thats because the bosses were being wined and dined by the platform For sure there was no way to know all the details like we do now Ive been doing this for a minute now and I still dont know what the fuck a media impression actually is It always kind felt like bullshit lol I also dont know who the fuck counts them! But any time a platform pushes a new capability that aggressively, its cause for concern. One time we were told we had like 1 billion impressions on something and I was like...thats possible??? Yeah lol Impressions is the biggest bullshit metric in marketing Youll get more impressions than like the entire us population Also all the metrics ad agencies roll out at award shows are essentially made up For sure Pop quiz : impressions vs reach Impressions is all potential And can be duplicate Reach is how many unique users your content made it to. But those users could represent multiple impressions. We have a winner ! ?So in sum: technology, what is it? They count people with Adblock? Good question Brock idk We doing a live draft this Wednesday for the Portland boys? https://twitter.com/TheSteinLine/status/1183892549175521281 Dubov I guess we could!

I kinda wish they lost damn Omg That was infuriating Like I dont care about this game ? Ian you had Detroit what are you complaining about! But like we just got robbed of watching a game winning drive I know! But like barring a pick 6 I was gonna win anyway Sounds like you do care about the game lol No Detroit covered So like The game just being over the way it ended Was like best case scenario for me Serious question, how did people gamble before Venmo and PayPal Actual money and you spent six weeks trying to collect Envelopes of cash delivered to their barber And then your friends just like Ill just buy us pizza And you accepted But then let it stew for like weeks Nice lil comeback the week That was week four It wasnt the massacre of week 5 Hey man No like week four between us I just lost by .1 points cuz Aaron Rodgers kneeled twice and i got negative points Washington fans must have been happy they could honor Columbus Day with a victory this week I needed 14 points from Stafford got 11 what a bitch lost by 3 ? Theres a good lesson in this It fucking sucks to be the Detroit lions Patricia still outlasting chip No question I mean the lions look decent this year They just got royally fucked lol Wow I cant believe they lost Ive been in the blog bunker for the last hour I wasnt even watching Nobody blows leads like the lions Refs blew those two illegal contact calls on flowers Fuck the pack Yeah lol The lions got got fucked so so so bad ? Man this must have been some egregious shit? Everybody around me in this bar is bitching about it. Wasnt unbelievable. Just like dumb and stole a fun ending away Def a bad call and just weird at that point in the game also My entire timeline, group chats, and this whole bar are talking about nothing else. Im in an echo chamber. Welcome to the zeitgeist ! If this game was at 10am on a Sunday would people care as much? Def not https://deadspin.com/lets-not-get-too-excited-about-tyler-herro-the-greates-1839044912 https://twitter.com/shamscharania/status/1184096777785561088?s=12 Shitty but hopefully well have him for conference ? Preseason just got a lot tougher tho Feel like it wouldve been nice to have him vs James Wiseman? Exactly- that game loses a little luster now Lol we need the Nike kapernick style Daryl morey ad Just the exact same black and white print But moreys big pasty mug Come on Dubov! Im giving you a freebie here Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything. Surprised nobody has done a LeBron one. Someone with a twitter following make it and tweet it Believe in something. Unless it means sacrificing signature sales. Lol. Believe in nothing. Even if it means sacrificing nothing. Lol ? Lol this is like the Trump there's a tweet for everything game Oh twitter has been dragging Bron for 12 hours So many believe in something, not unless it hurts China sales Wow I just saw a cursed twitter bio: Beavers and Lakers LA is having a mini sports apocolypse right now Rams and chargers imploding, Kershaw gives up the series, USC an UCLA are 4-8 combined, LeBron is a Chinese agent, The kings are also 2-3, not sure if thats registering Speaking of LA sports, who is going to the USC game on 11.2? Cam whats the LA bro ticket situation? Ill be there https://twitter.com/chrisbhaynes/status/1184152554428485632?s=21 Nurk trying to dabble in that China market! Ni Hao Nurk! Rich Paul providing Klutch cover by bringing on a Muslim amid this China shit ?? All the Uyghurs in western China will be happy Ducks only -2.5 on Saturday? That seems... juicy Yummy Where you seeing 2.5? It shifted to 3 on Monday morning Wait which boys will be there? Ill be there Clay Dang son we are doing airBnB right by campus. You getting in Friday? Yeah Friday afternoon most likely. It was gonna be late but this morning my boss told me to take an unrecorded PTO day Friday so Im taking advantage Yea its 3 on bovada just checked. It was 2.5 on oddshark Ill be there as well I put down 2U on the ducks at -3 https://www.instagram.com/p/B3pGE0ejFCg/?igshid=199ftl3fy527s Is it just me or does McCaffrey look like a younger version of the detective in Mindhunter? Wow definitely The hair in that pic makes it more than usual ? Cooked this up real fast I think he could play him in the origin story mini series Lol McCaffrey can do it all! Except.... Be black? Win an MVP I mean hes a RB so he cant win that by default Did Shaun Alexander win mvp I just googled it he did !!!! Ha ha ! I mean he was like yard away from the rushing record Was that 30 years ago? Try 2005 ! And Andy Reid went with the Matt hasslebeck qb snack from 2 yards out lol Shauniqua At the end of the last game of the season lol Lol Homogeneous He was a huge bitch Holmgren I mean lol And LT won it the next year and AP in 2012 The precedent is there Its the analytics take that an RB cant win Or shouldnt Were the Seahawks still in theAFC back then? This feels like generations ago yup Because they dont touch the ball every play No they werent Alex I dont really agree with the reasoning tho because some touches are more valuable than others IMHO No Gunde its because the line play is by far more important than the rbs abilities O line making a great play is wayyy more important than an rb doing it Everyone is doing it w blocks 2012 the nfl was so different lol Since they started naming an MVP in 1975 .... The precedent has not been set 12 RB

32 QB

1 LB

1 KICKER (LMAO) Gundy what if we went to Buffalo gap to draft tomorrow Precedent. Set. Matt prater this year tho Fair I just do think CMC IS different than RBs who lineup outwide Most RBs dont even get 20 carries a game anymore its too hard for a back now And just his presence creates a ton of gravity for the other Carolina weapons to get open on QB is going to be the position from now on No WR ever is interesting Ive been watching TONS of panthers lol Barring a massive irregularity Kyle Allen is just Game managing Kinda crazy that Jerry Rice never won an Mvp EVERYTHING is CMC Yeh thats what Im saying dubov Or moss Like Im more talking eye test than pure yards. I get Russell will get more votes in seriousness, if hawks only get to 9 wins and panthers get to 12 then it will be interesting But like they have to win for him to get enough yards to get in the convo and that will be tough Like even the last game was a net negative for him He avg like 1.6 yardages. carry A RB is just not winning Its probably going to be DeShaun or Russ yah If Gurley couldnt get it a couple years ago its just not happening He went bananas passing and rushing and the team was really good He also was the only guy in the backfield. Still didnt stand a chance I think he finished third? If Russell wins MVP this year is he a HOFer? Gonna be a good debate Im not saying McCaffrey will win just saying that the precedent is there I mean is it? 2012 nfl is not nearly the same as it is now Both QB play and offenses in general The backup QB angle also enhances CMCs case https://twitter.com/KDTrey5/status/1184140634208329728 This thread lol Gundy Im assuming you already saw it how triggered are you lol Oh I mean I hate HP So im glad KD told him hes a nerd Ill be honest, that thread is fantastic That graph to KDs response is the whole point of Twitter Rachel Nichols argument for long 2's was cringe worthy tho She just jerks off players like no other in everything she says Im very pro taking the open shot Oh I agree. But that's not what the debate is centered on Yeah Im very pro having principles of what is a good shot but If you can step into an open midrange shot then you should take it Chad has told me in the past how Rachel Nichols jerks off players (cc: Dwayne Wade) Also it's more nuanced. Is there 20 seconds on the shot clock? Are you one foot inside the line I did hear from a reputable journalistic source that d Wade bent her over Hahahaha I mean if youre wide open one foot inside the line, yes take step back dribble (but make sure you only take two steps after you gather!!!) But I think KD is right in that guys are overthinking things on the floor in this era of analytics Players are processing in real time if a shot is efficient or if they should force a pass to a contested shot My high school coach was ahead of the times. We had a "layups or 3's only" rule back in '09 Yeah that's a fair argument Dubov My solution: flip the two point and three point zones. Behind the line is worth two and inside the line is three. Dunks are 4. Also all the best scorers shoot in the midrange anyway cause good defenses dont give them easy layups or 3s Yeah I'll take CJ midrange jumpers over layups all day Or like, floaters Like the Tony Parker floater is a legendary move Yeah he had one of the highest paint fg% in the league for years lol Like shooting from there is technically analytically bad We need more Shaqs and less Stephs I want broken backboards goddamnit Yeah Im worried about the post game Big guys arent dying but the post game is Guys also like, dont work on their post game anymore either. Not very many good post guys anymore when there used to be so many Yah I like some of goldsberrys ideas to revive it Im down with eliminating the corner 3 If you have less 3 point surface area you cant juice the spacing like you can now It also ruined NBA 2K Every midrange jumper is a brick lol https://es.pn/2VLTdfH If the XFL is back one would think reviving SlamBall is not that far behind. This will be sufficient for me I love SlamBall It would be a better Olympic sport than 3v3 If you dont love SlamBall, you are a fascist https://twitter.com/sfpelosi/status/1183941422396792832?s=21 wowow this is a scorching hot garbage take lol Woof Jalen RAMsey https://twitter.com/oliverhotham/status/1184244782102528000?s=21 ^ my guy out here looking wild glorious RAMsay Bolton Jalen EAGLEsy Mark comes in hot with the I love lamp moment Wow rams get ramsey Nice haul if they truly didnt want to pay him Think rams have more issues on offense than defense tho Too bad they didnt trade him for Goff https://www.instagram.com/p/B3qRgPZgxBS/?igshid=16mfwfs8ll2sz Mariota era over? I dont know that Tannehill will play good enough as a starter to command the starting job Probably a coin flip He's a FA this summer tho. Bet they move on after this season regardless Crazy he did beat the chiefs in the playoffs Who's gonna need a QB this summer? Gimme him or Scam Newton in Denver Fuck you chad you stole my theory! Haha what's your theory I'll co-sign it with you Lol no I never voiced it But cam to Denver If only we could get Denver native CMC with him What the panthers would def not get rid of cam If Kyle Allen goes 6-0 you don't think they ride it out? Trade cam for young assets Cam to the bears 0 shot. Kyle Allen isnt playing that well even Cam won the mvp 0-8 in his last 8 starts Matt Ryan won an mvp too Not advocating it but just saying I wouldn't be surprised Yah and Matt Ryan starting for the falcons for another three years min True true This debate is trash. Lizzie had five opportunities to say yes, taxes will go up to pay for Medicare for all and she continues to dodge the question. Coward. She's hanging her hat on the wording. She keeps referring to costs rather than taxes. It's an annoying political charade but it makes sense given that 90% of people are just going to hear her say taxes are going up and not listen to the rest I think that was true in the past but not any more This charade was cute in the first debate but now its just insulting to the American people 22 trillion in debt, of course taxes are gonna go fucking up When Bernie, Pete, Booker, even Biden are all willing to say taxes will go up you just look like a fool if you wont answer the question Shes not giving voters enough credit. They understand what shes saying. Howd Booker do? Am o smoking dust to think Warren/Booker is a good ticket lol Pete would drive a Chevy Cruze Of course he does The pool is looking pretty sad IMO I would like Booker to get more time Lol yeah the only thing worse would be a Ford Flex Klobuchar, Steyer, Yang need to get gone Gabbard too but she could get it on the way out Beto gotta go. Forgot he was even up there. Yang is a fucking clown That fucking nerd wore a MATH lapel pin FOH Steyer dropped 47 million out of his own pocket on his campaign... this quarter Yeah so he could get on the debate stage lol He ran a campaign with his own money to convince enough grassroots donors to give money so he could hit the donor threshold Just to get up there and rage for impeachment Wow mariners only team to never make WS now Y'all are haters Yang is a man of the people Gabbard can take her Assad apologist rhetoric and gtfo Sidebar: anyone finish peaky blinders yet You see the squad is officially endorsing Bernie Yeah Mark is that that animal kingdom remake? That was always gonna happen Tulsi is so hot when she talks Middle East policy Talk Assad to me baby All I can say about AOC is that I live in her district, and while the Bronx has its trouble Ive been pretty impressed with the amount of social services Ive seen And people using them Not sure how much that would have to do with her You can thank Donald Trumps policies for that I feel like warren came under fire, Biden brushed off Ukraine and Pete went on the attack What about you guys ? Lol wut? I see what you did Matt Do we know draft order yet for basketball draft tomorrow? Wow you didnt invite me to the league this year? Pretty messed up guys I'm confused by Kamala trying to hang her hat on the "boot trump off Twitter" take What space Im not allowed to join in the political discourse ? great now shes the twitter police They should make Kamala the USAG Wow Yang taking pot shots at Bing lmao Kamala out here talking about twitter followers like that number means anything I bet she doesnt even know the difference between impressions and reach Or the difference between followers and subscribers http://vm.tiktok.com/5mEwoq/ Boys would I ever let this happen https://www.oregonlive.com/business/2019/10/oregon-lottery-website-crash-not-from-sports-betting-app-launch-officials-say.html Wonder how many blazers bets that will take in a year Brock I hope your alibi is airtight.

Paging @capologist_butler He wants 4/110 Shared that yesterday but fuck me right Well! looks like you got shadow banned chad Sometimes I feel like I'm writing in invisible ink guys!! Lol in his defense he did average 21/5/2 on 43% from 3 Yah im going to say he can prob get more than 90 then 43% from 3 is nice And that was high volume. 8 attempts a game. Same as Dame Also, this is classic Sacramento ineptitude. They start making some good moves, get a good young core, then they give Harrison Barnes $85 million this summer. And might lose buddy over it I remember you breaking it down yesterday This was a follow up to that Im suggesting its ridiculous that he says hes offended lol Lol I'm just fucking with you. But yeah that is a bold stance to take. I feel like they could meet in the middle at 4/100 and everyone would be happy Also do we know the full China fall out? Could the cap shrink next year like some were saying? He might wanna take his money Get a player option on year 4 The China thing is still getting sorted but I think what happens is the league as a whole remains mostly unaffected while the Rockets business side gets fuckrd *fucked tencent is already back to streaming nba preseason minus Rockets Does anyone want Denver +3 Woof no thanks I lost $100 during lunch yesterday on the pigs at the Hooters in Jantzen Beach Thought I should inform the group of this Damn thats rough God that sucks the good news is you can win it back on the Clemson/Louisville over this weekend Ooh you got an angle? I just think 60.5 is super low for two teams that score a shit ton of points and dont play defense https://twitter.com/ndrew_lawrence/status/1184647737050062848?s=21 This is incredible. Does he not realize the irony? Lol Hes like a bizarro Kendall Roy / Simple Jack hybrid Mulvaney also just admitted in testimony that there was a quid pro quo lol The galaxy brain has started early today I can already see the new rnc talking point. "Okay it was a quid pro quo about investigating the DNC Servers from 2016! It was never about Biden" Guys guys guys this is all just a smoke screen to distract us from the REAL story https://twitter.com/guyfieri/status/1184887580984262663?s=21 Jesus Christ. The G7 in June is confirmed at Trump Doral Resort. Which is in Miami. During hurricane season And climate change won't be on the agenda lol of course https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1184879214320914433?s=21 Mulvaney just admitted to Quid Pro Quo These guys are such fucking morons its unbelievable Also, hosting the G7 at a Trump property is a massive fucking conflict of interest that weve just come to accept as normal Its a 3:45 clip but the last 30 seconds are golden Mulvaney was adamant Trump isn't profiting off the event. How can you possibly say that with a straight face? Lol of course he's profiting he still owns it https://twitter.com/bobbymarks42/status/1184806072898478086?s=21 Yikes. Beal's extension was a smart move on his part. Can opt out after his 10th year and get max dollars on a 4/5 year deal Also good for Washington cuz his trade value is gonna be higher now That Wall deal is atrocious tho ?Nba GM survey came out today. Angry Westbrook and kyrie stans everywhere Its Currys MVP to lose this year You think he'll top his unanimous mvp year? More specifically you think he'll average over 30? Giannis is a fat fav but I think hes a bad deal AD +700, embiid + 1200, lillard +2800, would be my bets i like that AD value. Not high on Embiids chances unless he plays more games. I would go Harden too I like the Embiid bet actually And LeBron, he might average a career high in assists this year If he can play 70 games and they get the 1 seed Its Lillards to lose 64 games for Embiid. No way he plays more than that. NBA benefits from more mvps across the league 20 bucks says he beats it Bet ?? I think its between him and kawhi tho Wait chad 64.5 I say under I want a winner. No push. Deal Kawai playing 30 games Mvp alllll about guys who will care about reg season For sure I agree with Rengel too. League wants more mvp's Kawaii wont give a shit I think Jim Harden is gonna get a major energy boost from Westbrook Jokic, Embiid, AD etc would all be sick But dame has as good a shot as any Harden is def eligible Who better than a small market guard with the worlds biggest chip on his shoulder Jokic is not a candidate in my mind Donovan michell? Oh dame Mitchell not good enough You don't think if the nuggets get the 1 seed he has a chance? Im out on Jokic this season maybe Im overvaluing FIBA but he looked bad Wont say no chance but dont see it. He looked slower on defense Dont think he has another monster level to get to Hes just good Hassan Whiteside NBA Most Improved Player Luis Scola was COOKING Jok ANT Fair point. He's not sexy enough to win in my books On the court and off Just too ugly I don't think Harden wins again God how great would that be with the China narrative tho 50/1 for ant most improved Ooooh Dude that's a lock! Damn Im gonna have to place a wager on that Okay I take it back Lol. You have to average 20 a game to win Anfernee Simons 6MOY?? Im actually super curious what Terrys rotation is gonna be Given the fact that I wanted to scream at him many times last year Other than Siakam who was a beast across the board, last player to win MIP and not average 20 points a game was Paul George in 2012 He gonna keep leaving Dame on the bench until 5 minutes left in the 4th? God if he does that I'll break my tv Makes zero sense Real reason Chad bought a house: he can scream at the tv every zers game. No wall neighbors I think Skal is in the rotation cause Pau isnt cleared Take dame out with 3 minutes left in the 3rd. Put him back in if you have the ball with the shot clock off and can score to end the quarter. Then leave him on the bench til 10 min left in the 4th And we are gonna play two traditional bigs a ton Is ZC first off the bench or is he starting? Starting 4 ZC starting W/ Whiteside? Dame CJ Hood ZC Whiteside Yup nice Apparently they bullied the Jazz last night but preseason etc Bazemore is gonna be a breath of fresh air from ET He's looked so nice And can actually shoot the 3 Base, Simons, Hezonja, Skal (until Paul is cleared) I wouldnt go any deeper than that *Baze Dude hes also fresh off the NBAs version of a depressive episode. He cant wait to play meaningful ball again 7'0 wingspan for Baze. Compared to ET's trex arms = much better defense too You know I love a long wingspan Yeah I also heard that ET was mentally checked out last year Shout out to him for Game 7 but he was fed up with Terry Blazers: mental health capital of the nba They need to lean into it! Wait blazers play in Denver tonight?? Yeah dude! Back to back tho Damn yeah dame and CJ def ain't playing then huh Ant will def probably play Yeah I would assume Dame, CJ and Whiteside are all sitting We wont know until later Tickets are 3 bucks. Keep me posted God Denver really doesnt give a fuck about the nba lmao I know its preseason but 3 bucks lol If youre a parent theres absolutely no reason to take your kid to that They dont know the difference Kinda surprising - since Jared Jeffries told me he calls it Menver Menver is a very real thing I can confirm the Menver thing https://twitter.com/anthonyvslater/status/1184706046499024897?s=21 I fully support all Robert Sarver slander Lol watch Chriss get cut in 3 weeks So fivethirtyeights got the fucks at 65% for the playoffs if we win out Seems high, no? Seems right If Alabama and Clemson are locks then it'd be between Ohio State/Penn State, Oklahoma and us for the final two Well one loss Clemson beats ducks same with one loss sec ND is a problem Gotta hope LSU loses to Auburn and Bama NDs schedule is so bad. They wont get in LSU is the problem for sure. Oklahoma still has to play @KSU, ISU, @Baylor, @OKST and probably Texas again. I bet they drop one of those games. Georgias loss killed nd Acc is worse power conference- Pac-12 actually kinda strong overall we need Wisconsin to upset Ohio State next week Is it an upset tho? Id love a Wisconsin Oregon rose bowl again No but if Ohio State drops that game and then beats Penn State Tru One of those two would end up probably playing Wisconsin in the BIG championship Which Ohio State would probably get revenge And then its a 3-way argument over who deserves it They win that game 59-0 and Cardale Jones clips is in the natty again That conference is gonna get super messy. ND needs Michigan to beat PSU this week but I dont think its gonna happen. https://gen.medium.com/which-of-the-democratic-contenders-are-actually-republicans-f7511f0c2053 ?This is a helluva ad. I'm trying to add nba league pass and they show me Dame scoring over Mitchell Boys how do we like the line tonight Feels like the public is a little too down on the Chiefs -3 Ill take that Denver action Gunde I already bet https://twitter.com/thehill/status/1184923536458178561?s=21 ?

What do you mean drop-off? Dylan got Trae Young at 10! Value! Speaking of value. That white blazers rip city and red hoodie are not at the ES yet. But the throwback jersey is. Dame and CJ. No Hezonja unfortunately. I need a Simons This is like getting a young Neymar jersey Like before all the rape stuff Santos Neymar Idk if you guys are up on The Curse of RyCole but this is bad news for Zion and the Pelicans https://twitter.com/justrycole/status/1184966007565144065?s=12 The message boards are saying torn MCL Fuuuuuuuuck Woj said its not your typical knee soreness which sucks That would be fucking devastating Yeah it would be, NBA bet big on Zion, he has a ton of national games Random question Dubov but do they have those blazers jerseys in toddlers size at es? Ive never been in the kids/toddlers section at the ES But I doubt it Ill check next time Im in there Rengel Jr on the way confirmed Rengel I knew you'd break the news in blazers fashion. Congrats man! wow. I saw Michael and a question about toddler stuff and my brain automatically assumed Dehaan Mazel tov Rengel! I shouldve known better. Dehaan never comments in here. You are hiding a child No but nieces favorite player is CJ McCollum lol Michael "Aubrey Graham" Rengel https://twitter.com/MasonGinsberg/status/1184958645991301121 Anyone following this Pastor Wilson trend on Twitter right now? Because its WILD Damn Mahomes dislocated knee? https://twitter.com/chold/status/1184999255540264960?s=12 lol backhanded compliment I was shocked Denver got best home court advantage on the GM survey but I guess they put a lot of stock in the altitude Dislocated knee can actually be a relatively quick recovery Unless something tore Porzingis, Doncic, Kleber, Zubac all starting in this game. Thats a lotta big whites. Omg Boban is in now. This is my kinda hoops. Hezonja with 18/6/5 off the bench right now #PointForward #PositionalRevolution Its a real possibility that hes been completely misused his entire career Removed an exclamation from Its a real possibility that hes been completely misused his entire career He absolutely was But thats what happens when you played for the magic and Knicks lol https://twitter.com/goducks/status/1185016414505037824?s=12 No way we are losing this weekend Still waiting for the Virgil Abloh unis Remember last year when I was cast as sick-hearted cynist fir suggesting maybe the the Pat Connaughton revolution was not yet upon us? nmo no No but I remember when u almost ended the group chat for good by calling trump laden Milwaukee a more diverse city than our beloved perfect Portland Oregon In a group of hot takes spaces are frequently the hottest and I gotta tip my cap to that ?Ledlow said it herself Spaceman with the hottest takes Shoutout to her penny shirt Rough night for Jack West. Kid has gotten his ass kicked. Lol goddamnit No One person in this chat who wont be named Called Milwaukee a white city Which is a weird characterization for a city thats nearly two thirds black Bro I spent four days there and didnt see a single non-white, hotel staff included. That was my experience. Especially when you live in the whitest city in the country lol It wasnt you Dubov lol Oh lol I thought it was Carry on I guess take that up with the census beureau Bureau* Thats a tough word Really is lol Unmask the Milwaukee slanderer! Who was it?! Mark? It was def jimmy To be fair Dubov the Midwest is pretty segregated And by really I mean extremely Milwaukee is just a Chicago suburb Thats fair I was mostly in downtown, Marquette campus area, and whatever rich as fuck suburb Bubba is from Yeah its really insane, last week when I was in Detroit I saw far more white people than anyone else Detroit is 85% black Wtf I didnt say that Hahah welcome back jimmy Haha I have been there though and it was very white but I still didnt say that I dunno man thats now how I remember it Bureau is both an organizational body and a chest of drawers Just admit it and apologize jimmy, time to grow up. Wow I just got boned in this Stanford game Thats a bad beat Space you find the text and Ill apologize And fuck Stanford so glad they suck this year Lol dude Im kidding Haha I know Jimmy whats your grandpas take on this Stanford team? Im afraid to ask... Random but based on the Ms being last team to not appear in WS. At least theyll have a Red Sox and cubs like moment when it happens Portland will prob win the World Series before we do https://youtu.be/p46BGkWa_oI Watch these 2 minutes and tell me the blazers aren't winning it all this year Fuck that gets me hard Love it If that link had been a virus Id have the virus because I clicked it instantly without any hesitation Yeah same here. He's got that midrange jumper down He pretty much plays exactly how we hoped Meyers would have played ?See you in the finals! But watching Meyers slide laterally for 5 seconds and you could see he doesn't have a fast twitch muscle in his body Hey man Meyers got 3 rebounds in 28 minutes for us tonight so watch your mouth Lmao You're gonna fucking hate him in about 2 weeks Bam got 13 in 24 lol He just posted an insta with a navy seal line as the caption. Dude you weren't in the military Home sat key hell prob be best friends with jimmy butler Two corniest dudes in the league Jimmy only likes Herro https://twitter.com/xxl/status/1184911380761235456?s=21 ?????? https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1185218470096592896?s=21 ?

Thats my favorite papa Murphys pizza Jesus I'm listening to the Simmons russillo over/under pod. You can tell they haven't paid a second of attention to Portland. Simmons said 46 is way too high lmao Also "who starts at the 4? There's no way in hell Collins starts there". Everything they said after that was invalidated Anyone doing my under over please copy Simmons calls ?? He's so dumb https://twitter.com/monroelapaislie/status/1184965912073527296 Amazing https://www.instagram.com/p/B3wtlk3jCbl/?igshid=1botqpl7dms1u Drop Bayless Drip * Hahahaha Old man ?We ready. Go ducks. Vamos Patos I was just on a flight for from seattle to San Diego and was wearing Ducks gear and there was 0 Washington gear in sight Theyre scared Im working on a concept Very rough but think about this - its the Boston tea party but instead of the dock in Boston its the Washington fans tailgating and its the something TD party with Oregon players pouring footballs or something in the bay Sailgating** Yeah one day I would love to do the Sailgating at a Oregon-UDub Im sailgating tomorrow Or maybe like we could just go to a duck game and skip the game but go on a hike and do mushrooms. Trailgating! Or we could go to the game and get so drunk we throw up and pass out in the parking lot and never make it In the game. Failgating! Mark remember when you were talking shit about sailgating The second one is being a bills fan I was I think its retarded I also got billed for it So Ill be there Its gonna be 50 degrees and raining and on a boat ?Btw already flipped my Travis Scott's and looks like I did it just in time cuz price came down a ton I saw somebody wearing those yesterday Were they fly? I didn't even get to open them Wait why was I not aware you had those? Lol I sent it in the group chat Chad sold em cheap, $600 for the left one and $600 for the right one I think I even said hey cam check it out chad = shadow banned im telling you I cant keep up these days IM sorry brother Thats fucking dope and Im jealous I think I have been shadow banned. Wait til Brock's analytics come out in January I'll have the most texts sent with zero response Already getting excited to drop the next word cloud HEZONJA CUM Hezonja hezonja hezonja Cum cum cum Heat , Miami heat, Meyers Leonard, NBA Finals 2020, south beach , Elle Leonard ?Preach Zach! God please https://twitter.com/cfbquotes/status/1185259883781705729?s=12 Anybody see these tweets? Lol Wonder what it would take to get Griffin. Could we keep Zach and Simons? Swanigan comeback season? Lol Ian have fun with Meyers this year Maybe we can trade him and a few stale empanadas for kawhi Leonard? Hahaha dude Griffin will get traded His contract is too big and Detroit sucks Salary cap relief and several firsts gets you in the conversation Lol I agree but whats your offer? Again, outside of Portland no one cares about zac Collins. And if thats too much, what could you possibly give? Blake is still a baller lol Lol dude that's not true at all. People who watch basketball know Zach Collins ceiling Shit even Russillo said he has Kevin Mchale esque footwork Dude youre insane, he became completely irreplaceable in the playoffs Hahahaha What are you talking about? He was key in beating the nuggets Irrelevant Yeah and then flamed our and got benched He put both out starting forwards on the bench What series did you watch You know what gimme the over under on zacs ppg/rpg What youd be willing to bet money on Your comment that he was irrelevant in the playoffs tells me everything I need to know about your Zach Collins knowledge You tell me Name your number I said after the Denver series dude! "He became completely irrelevant in the playoffs" ? This isnt impressive especially for a team down its starting center Below 10/below 8 Like come on dude, Blake averaged 25, 8 and 5 No one is gonna give up a batter package? That team did go to the playoffs lol 10 points / 7.5 rebounds? 10.5/7.5 Deal Ill trade you that half point for that have rebound Lol ok I'll bet you $100 on the over Deal If we split its a wash Fair Like if he averages 12/6 Sounds good Glad to have a new reason to root for whiteside I'm buying a Collins jersey now. I'm all in I would say we should make an injury exception but that could really fuck either of us So lets just let it ride lol I love it. Between this and Embiid over 64 games I'm gonna have some good subplots to follow Yeah this is fun lol But on the Blake point. He's one of those guys that has to go to a certain scenario. Only teams that have true championship aspirations are gonna trade for him. That limits it to 12 or so teams. Then factor in his contract and injury history I'm just saying it's not as simple as oh he averaged 25/8/5 every team would want him Obviously I'm a blazers homer lol but that was my point I mean but youre asking what you can get WITHOUT zac That would just be giving him away lol Salary relief plus 3 first rounders would be a good starting point Yeah, lets see I think the pistons will improve this year Also I thought Zach sucked so why is he so key to a trade all the sudden lol Also I thought I was just texting you a for a second space and forgot there's 10 other people here lol Ok I didnt say he sucked lol But hes not highly coveted Imo Well see tho Year three is when you gotta show something! I agree he's certainly not known by the casual fan or shitty GM Lol I watched a 2 minute pre season highlight last night and got hard as fuck okay Hey man Aminu averaged 9/7 last year tho and he'll easily take those numbers I also very much want preseason stats to be accurate! I'm most worried about the rebounds Oh I wasn't looking at stats. It's called the ol eye test lol I dunno man if murk comes back, and whiteside plays well Hes gonna be in trouble in regard to this bet Dude he's the starting 4 you know this right No lol Still cool tho Cool with my bet* ?Look at him stay close to Gobert to fend off the ally oop. Then block the initial shot. Then recover and block Gilbert's follow up That's elite! Whiteside got 11 blocks in a game once lol ?This is our new starting line up But I also think whiteside is gonna flourish in Portland His line was great when he played and hell kill in on the pick and role with lillard I love whiteside lol he was my favorite player ?Cool that Nike released a Michael Scott signature shoe https://twitter.com/anthonyvslater/status/1185236433470017537?s=21 Somewhere Neil Olshey is punching the air at that average age of the warriors We swapped places. Were the new dynasty of the league Were aging up boys Wait till we sign mello I want an old ass team of vets like the 2001 Zers with old Scottie Bonzi and old Ass sabonis https://twitter.com/buncahn/status/1183446961023676416?s=21 This is gold by the way cant remember if I shared already I dont think so goddamnit Shooter sent that to me Matty A couple days ago its great His Kendall is spot on https://twitter.com/tulsigabbard/status/1185289626409406464?s=21 Dubov's girl Oh yeah talk dirty Tulsi Not gonna lie Russillo needs to chill on the Kevin McHale talk I couldnt believe it lmao Lmao I got so hyped on that gundy Look at that 2 block sequence against the Jazz tho. Filthy footwork Lmao but in the exact same sentence he said hes not really that good Zach Collins is like Kevin McHale if he only posts up on guys shorter than him not named marcus smart Sidebar: Im going to Mexico and Im drunk Good thing he's taller than 90% of the league! And bigger than most of the 4s in the league these days too Portland is bringing back the two-big look I love this narrative that KD was a 7 footer 2 years ago Turns out hes not even close?! Whats his offish Brock? 69.5 Wow! Really??? ?I always thought this photo proved the 7' theory I heard that guys who are like 69 are really 7 footers with shoes on Like that was the delineation Simmons was talking about Tatum that way like he measured in over 68 so hes like 611 basically and grew Klay Thompson is only 65 - If only my parents invested in my basketball training I could be in the nba right now ??Clickbait vs. real journalism https://twitter.com/brvski_/status/1185272479285219328 ?GO! DUCKS Doobie (workshopping that nickname) where ya tailgating today? Some buddies have a spot I think in lot N25 I have to start there to get my tickets from them and then idk Was watching one of the College Football 150 specials on ESPN last night and the final clip of their intro was verdells gw td last year. Todays gonna be a good day They showed a chains, dreads & tattoos ... Michigan still sucks sign Chad your take is bad and you should apologize! https://www.instagram.com/p/B3sK3multTR/?igshid=1hfemp3y9mgrf Everyone picked the ducks.. plz dont jinx us Haha I never said he wasn't MVP! I said he wasn't a HOFer already If you wanna crown his ass, crown his ass! Lol I know but it all hinges on him having a Catastrophic injury Has the dude ever even missed a game? That's a good question. I don't think he has Just say your sorry Be the bigger man Youre* Im sorry that youre still hung up on this Not gonna say sorry. But I'll say I love really think pancakes Im talking to space Lol so was I ? I dunno Im gonna need an explanation as to how this is news ?

Damn now Im popping a b at the bagel place Lol I know But its a news notification As you can see in the top left corner Taking the light rail through Seattle to the stadium. Some Sounders geeds just got on. Im about to go mean street hooligans on they ass. Thats a ice trip! Did you take the train up? Green street gang gang We drove up yesterday. Staying at Shettys in Columbia City so were on the Link ? https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1185619666150068224?s=21 extension deadline is Monday. Do jaylen brown and buddy get contracts too? I'm guessing Celtics wait on Jaylen / maybe trade him for Sabonis. I bet Buddy and Sac meet in the middle at 4/100 ? Love Dicks Whats you get Two delux two fries? They gave us 24 burgers for free because we nigh were partying too hard That's epic Chad Its gonna be so funny if our Collins bets Is like close lol Rooting for his stats to go up or down like .1% every night Haha that would be amazing He just snags like 19 boards in the season finale to push me over the top https://twitter.com/dancingastro/status/1184950225854750721?s=21 America wasnt ready for that music video ?Zach Lowe postulating How has nassir been? Holy shit. Wisconsin falls Let's fucking go Scoooo ?LFG Ducks Surgical Cute kick off return Ian, Nasir had some great moments in our first preseason game against Michael Porter but hes been dealing with an ankle since then basically Aka we could trade him for Blake straight up FUCK God terrible Defense Gross That missed tackle was BUTT Lenior needed to keep outside leverage with no WR split out. Idk why we he shifted so far over I was so fucking pissed on that 3rd down tackle before the TD Dude gained like two extra yards that shouldnt have been there ?Is this in reference to the girls in their student section? Troy Dye bleeding a lot apparently but hes a tough MF Mark the live of that photo is the energy I need right now ? Why the hell are we still using win the day? Yeah I agree. Why the hell do mackelmore fucc bois still exist Im fucking upset with Justin My guy is trying too hard to put NFL films on tape, just take what the defense gives you That hat is a couple years old. Its from the doernbecher game. You guys see the Keenan Lowe vid!? I just did. Harrowing and somehow heartwarming at the same time Bro if the ducks lose thats like taking a shit in Keenan Lowes shoes How dare they! Lets fucking go!!! Its blowing up man Lowe is a national hero! Also sounds like hes the favorite to replace Don Essig. Sorry, Rengel. Crazy Herbert still basically the 8th best Oregon qb ever I cant stand watching him week after week. His decision-making is legitimately subpar Talent is all there The next NFL bust yay! were a QB bust factory high key And low key a defensive school lol all of our best NFL alums are exclusively defensive players lol Better career Josh Allen (white) or Herbert Josh Allen (white) prob Hes not afraid of running What has changed with our defense to allow them to run all over us all of a sudden? We gonna blame the rain? Marios clock management is Andy Reid esque Jesus Christ Damn uw has a receiver form Issaquah? Yeah Mario does not know how to manage time That was a total cock tease Clock tease Guys you can actually blame Herbert For multiple poor throws Lets stop getting upset with anyone else and lets blame the guy who deserves it. Walk the plank Herbert! Bench his ass! John Cena ???? Dylan arent you a beavers fan now? Yeah its pretty ridiculous how off his throws have been today I mean all year too Hes just happy to be a ducks qb Habibi! Why is defense getting shredded Washington coach looks like baby billy So many dicks in the last episode Herbert has been so inconsistent its sickening. What the fuck was that? Throw to the flat 10 feet from the closest guarded receiver? Fuck yes That was huge Beavs over hitsss Ducks wont cover Its all over Psh! 4 point win still in sight! I love fat Mac Habibi! $$$$$$& John Cena my American! Sco! WOWOWOWOW LFG Need that pick six Fuck fuck fuck ? SMDFTB DAWGS Wow we got away with one there haha Did we cover? Im on streams Lets go!!!!

Hey man this guy is overcoming real adversity Writing a book while having a puppy! Tweet him back and tag Oliver M! Get this man someone w professional media experience That would be quite the collab. All we'd need is Meyers to make the ultimate trio ? Chapter 1: The Puppy who lost its way Damn guys Week 5 of the degenerate bowl Ive got nine dogs And two favs ? Space:

 Bovada doesnt work in Mexico but I put in a couple of parlays before leaving. ?? I just side bet 3 dogs for the record Lol smart man Ill take Texans and rams if anyone wants action ? Texans were my first pick! Lol mark I should have let you have the Niners in a change for the hawks this week Gonna go get drunk with the worst person in New York (Houman) and watch all the games Im all in on dogs for one parlay. Gonna be a big day Nobody wants action? https://twitter.com/adamschefter/status/1185957916915970054?s=21 It makes me laugh every time Jon Gruden says he needs pass rush help He beat the bears and got josh Jacobs for cheap out of the deal so I think hes somewhat redeemed That's true that was a good pick And he's cheap Raiders might make the playoffs its wild He came in and wanted his guys and to build his team and hes doing that its hard to look at one move cause at the end of the day Kahil Mack is a HOF generational talent and isnt winning anyone a super bowl Nonetheless though makes you giggle when he says they need pass rushers lol Lol Is Gruden fucking paying you dude? What the fuck was that! Bro give me a heads up next tim youre about to cause me brain damage You might as well of hit me in the face with a shovel #FaxOnly bro I think its fair to say the trade was dumb but mayock nailed the draft picks Im just saying he might make the playoffs and just crushed the team that he made the trade with can we cut him a little slack? Is ferrel playing well? And josh Jacobs is an rb thats a wasted pick I mean, hes like their entire offense bro I dont think its that bad lol Eh rather draft an impact position and had it to latevious Murray So if they didnt make the trade the raiders are 5-1 right now? Im just confused You have to think about cap room too Its not just talent for talent its making use of rookie contracts Right but thats not what chad said lol Pete carrol is a pretty good coach. He also should have ran the fucking ball! Lol fair enough But I agree with the trade The raiders are -20 tho Theyre prob a fake good team Prolly I dont think Gruden sucks but that particular trade was capricious at best! They have the 4th most cap space Right behind the dolphins. Theyre in a good building position I would argue the amari Cooper trade mightve been worse! their receivers are hot garbage Also a bad trade! Ryan Pace is a much worse GM the bears are in an awful place I mean tribusky just sucks lol also they get the bears 1st and 3rd this next draft too The bears are fucked I mean theyre 3-2 and +18 Wow cardinals fucking Rams 4th in the west Heard it here first! Yes phins Matt Patricia taking away goal line touches from Kerryon ?????? Rams need to cut gurley so they dont feel obligated to give him the ball If only the raiders had Mack theyd be shutting out the packers! Oops lmao what a catch Hekkkerrr This is the Aaron Rodgers game I've been waiting for Just needed a matchup with that great raiders team dylan Its Danny Dimes time Wow yeah that raiders d is stacked! Lol Yes if only they had Mack Rodgers career would be over 3-0 today Im back! Lololol gotta love the Washington 0-9 cover What a day to have Marvin Jones on your fantasy team. 4 tugs Pete terrible challenge Dude is concussed 4 weeks now Eh first half Go for the challenge why not Cause the refs all agreed they will never overturn a PI call Wow Peters Eeeek Lol congrats on benching chase Edmonds this week Wahhh I have every handcuff now mwhahah Who the fuck is chase Edmonds. I've never even heard of that dude Lol youre cooked this year man How do we feel about Lakers -2 on opening night? No Im not Youre 2-5? If I can win this week Ill be right in the mix and again Ill exploit these stupid waiver rules all year Please count me out ?? ?? ?? Lolol youre gonna be last one points! Will do! Ive noticed youve been top scorer quite a few years!! ???? How foolish of me! Go Bears! Lmao Mitch is so bad Anyone want eagles +3 I cant stop betting on the cowboys its a problem Wow that chargers cover is disgusting 2 onside kicks for bears wow https://twitter.com/azcardinals/status/1185995471103373314?s=21 Solid trolling by social media team , pretty heartless Nice thing since Ian started ragging on me latavious scored 2 tds and Im proj to win by 10 See you in 4 weeks @Ian_holmes https://www.instagram.com/p/B33FjScg8Yd/?igshid=v9otqlosvkml Perfect content , brands wish they could put out content this pure Omg lmaoooo Im just watching it on loop at this point Yeah lol Little man went all in If he missed that cushion he breaks four ribs lol Didnt brace for a fall at all lol My favorite part is when he dabs right before he jumps My favorite part is the parents are more committed to the content than the safety of their child. I respect the shit out of that. How do you think Americas funniest home video existed for decades ? I was thinking the same thing g Dubov lol But clearly this kid knew he could make the jump Zero hesitation Absolutely. It was all or nothing Yeah lol Youre never gonna stop a little boy from diving into couch cushions Onto* Might as well get the likes If you think this kid hasnt done this before then you dont know Hollywood! Didnt you do this from the 2nd story in Sunriver isn? OT was that Mullaney? Ian* Twas i And then the I threw vodka on the burner and then you throw a handle at me Good times Yep its coming back to me - I think I was yelling at one of Dubovs osu friends too. Lol good times fo sho In defense having a Sunriver house in your name is stressful https://twitter.com/packers/status/1186008964418461696 Hall of Fame? Massive field goal Love it 63 yarder absolutely crushed it Wow have been good from 70 ? Ugh I hate that hes on the Jazz so much Ducks are playing the huskies on ESPNU - if u want to end your weekend on a high note Nice Dehaan ! ESPN still working on their gambling coverage. 

Molly: take it or leave it: do the Jets cover the spread tonight against the pats?

Stephen A: what's the spread? 

Molly: 10 

Stephen A: leave it! I think the Jets lose by less than that tonight! https://twitter.com/carmichaeldave/status/1186307318952017924?s=21 I'm guessing 4/$100M https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1186316753292447746?s=21 So on averageee.. I feel like there should be more incentive based contracts like this. He makes all star games, he gets closer to the $106 number, and team is probably doing well so it's a win win. He doesn't play that well, he still secured a lot of money I just put it out there https://twitter.com/erik_gundersen/status/1186318538560065536?s=21 Man I dont get this at all lol Whoa clips so low! Bro the blazers arent going to finals lol Guard play! Inject this into my veins gundy. 50 year anniversary! It's destiny Don't hate space. You gotta get on board one day I will honestly root for the blazers this year as long as whiteside gets some run but Theyre not going to the finals. The clippers would devour them in a series imo but if not then, someone else Yeah I agree on the Clippers take. They're too good I'm feeling a WCF return tho I mean youre also expecting a healthy clippers team which may be totally off We dont even know when PG is back, and reg season Kawhi gonna chill I think Gundy's right about a low seed. They're gonna load manage. But regular season doesn't matter Assuming they're healthy in the playoffs they're the best team. Regardless if they're the 7 seed Clippers
Rockets
Denver
Golden state
Portland
Lakers 
Jazz
San Antonio I think 3-6 will be super tight Clips not getting number one seed They dont care Denver or Houston getting the 1 seed IMO Lakers
Clippers
Nuggets
Rockets
Warriors
Jazz
Spurs
Kings
 I mean the raptors would have been the 1 seed in the west last year? And the clips seem to be better? Clips seem a little more top heavy tho yeah? They aren't gonna go 17-5 when Kawhi rests like Toronto did Yeah I do agree people dont realize how deep toronto was But I dunno theyve got PG and Lou Williams Who are both capable of carrying a team when kawhi is out PG hurt still PG out at least 10 games to start Also wouldn't be surprised if they rested Kawhi and PG at the same time some games Right but kawhi wont be resting that early Says who Thats possible I dunno I bet he doesnt!? Again theres 0 incentive to win games Eh, thats mostly true But seeding matters And players want to win I meant later in the year on both them resting. Even when PG is healthy they'll load manage him too. It's the nature of the game these days You know who doesn't load manage? Harden and Russ. They'll be a top 2 seed and lose in the conference semis I dont know how exactly to quantify it but I do think the Clippers snuck up on people last year. Everyone is circling that game on the calendar now, thats a different animal IMO Lol you dont even have the heat in the playoffs in the east!? Below Detroit and Chicago! That was an oversight I thought about when I went into town but I cant change it back now lma Chicago will be good tho I feel strongly about that Good enough for playoffs at least Blasphemer ! I mean sure lol, why not I think philly could win it all Lauri and Wendell are fucking sick and Otto porter is mad underrated Milwaukee too who knows Man this season is gonna rock I think chi is at least a year out They went 22-60 last year lol Lauri is good but not that good I dunno tho maybe coby is raw But I think Atlanta is in better shape to turn the corner I HATED Atlantas offseason tbh Giving up hella picks for DeAndre hunter, trading Tauren prince for Allen Crabbe, maybe Cam Reddish will be sick in addition to Trae Ian get those under over picks in, you know you want that Zers under Dubov you only have 6 in Chad you are at 4 Cam at 5 Mark you are empty Micheal empty Yep planning on finishing this up tonight - appreciate the reminder yee Make sure to get 5 spuerpicks Can you re-link/ Dude high up inmy NFL over under forgot and only put in 4 lol Im winning this year I can feel it ?@space Wow owned Lol chad they also have the blazers ranked 10 there I believe Lol ain't nobody saying that about the heat that's for sure That's the 10th question they asked in the segment Brock Again better that the Miami Heat prob shouldnt be the bar for a team with title aspirations lol Never said it was Just love every chance to talk shit lol Damn Sac-Town getting a MLS team Yea they confirmed it last week. Its completely asinine that theyre trying to get to 30 clubs, but Sacramento has great fans and deserve a team. Yeah that is pretty wild - 30 teams seems like a bit much Leagues should have no more than 20. Betting top 4 East teams under as usual this year. Hasnt gone worse than 2-2 in ~15 years Brock can I have 5 more picks so I can bet every East team under? Should go 13-2 https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1186362922932625408?s=21 Don't we got an open roster spot ?? Cant wait for ice cubes tweet https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1186368729061441536?s=21 Wow That's a lot of dough Whats the alternative if youre Boston? Only other option is waiting til summer and matching whatever he gets He was restricted Still wonder if they trade him for Sabonis. Seems like a win for both teams I wish Sabonis was a Zer Yall would trade Zach for Sabonis eighth Right? Yes Yeah I would too but I dont think neils ego will let him Trade for Sabas Lite, sign Joe J, win chip. I'm a mini Mchale believer. Gimme Zach I love the energy Chad! When you have the opportunity to go get the defending Big 3 MVP you go get the Big 3 MVP. Zach is gonna get MIP talk this year. I'm all the way on board My only question is whos gonna be an all star first. Ant or Zach? Tie So we getting 3 all stars? Cant forget soon to be first time All-Star CJ McCollum! It will placate China by giving them a Li-Ning athlete https://twitter.com/shamscharania/status/1186373077539737601?s=21 Now that is a bargain Wow Well we can throw that trade out. He cant be traded for 6 months after signing a rookie extension Big dick negotiating by Pritchard https://twitter.com/shamscharania/status/1186373810729246720?s=21 It gets better! Zion outty Link! Wowowow https://twitter.com/shamscharania/status/1186382598085533696?s=21 Damn I called it At least they're doing the safer surgery and not ripping his meniscus out like bRoy Fuuuuuuuuu Fuck man! I knew this was bad Goddamnit Guys Maroney called this months ago. Zion could be the best player from that draft but he also might not Gotta give him credit Anything good crossing the maroney wire lately? Miss that guy Haven't seen anything major lately. He was pretty tore up by the joe Johnson news. You'd think his Big 3 experience would have landed him a full time roster spot ? ? Never mind my earlier comment. Sounds like they removed the portion of meniscus rather than repair it. Hopefully it was a very small piece they removed otherwise he fucked long term Zion = Anthony Bennett

Prove me wrong. So mark would share his idea got it Anyone else ?I just realized we have the highest payroll in the league this year Lol Fucking lmao Jody high roller This is the first time Meyers and ET havent been on the team in 3 years? Its glorious https://twitter.com/muthafuckingjay/status/1185796330406502401?s=21 The accuracy That clip has been memed heavily last few days and I gotta say its a great clip Agreed Might surpass the idris Elba clip as the most memed hot ones clip Wow lol Dion waiters is hella pushed that people like Tyler herro better than him lol Brother Clifford just FaceTimed me from Spain #VDB Was he shit faced? Every time Ive talked to him hes been smashed. Hahaha Yes! Him and his girl were fucking lit lmao BAHAHA Love that for him I can't believe the nba season starts tomorrow. And Blazers Wednesday. My blazer boner is fully torqued Blazers fans are believing. My tweet has gone crazy today lmao Im so hyped for Wednesday Crazy that this is year 8 for Dame Nba season starts January But Im excited as well. Its full blown ducks/hawks season Yeah we getting old lmao I remember watching us pick Dame in Eugene I was in Seattle watching it with Dylan. Good times Houman you're the guy that says you only have to watch the 4th quarter of games Us real fans are strapping in Houman is a fan when its convenient 1000% As Ive gotten older, sports dont matter. Its for my enjoyment. So I tune it when its enjoyable. Nobody likes losers You sound like a loser right now And as you said nobody likes those Lol Coach Dehaan taught me that winners only matter Houman thats not true at all. If nobody liked losers we wouldve kicked you out of this group a long time ago. Wow talk about personal shots ??????? Low hanging fruit Lmao I feel like this Kuzma tweet is the meme of the season Im The skip bayless of the group Ive accepted that role. The man is on tv still Cant argue with that He makes over six figures It might be the most petty tweet Ive ever seen Brock But it looks like Dubov is not getting free healthcare ??????? Houman said he didnt care about the ducks a month ago... Eating popcorn while you see Zion get injured lmao .... Rengel thats something skip would say ?Except you did You just proved my point Houman you don't get to come to the championship parade when we win it all. Only fans that were there the whole season Ehhh I domt think thats how it works Anyone wanna gamble tonight? Im feeling jets Yea Im on pats Jets are +10 $10 Lets ride. I got jets Oh yea nothing says lets ride like $10 This could be a very dumb bet. But I need a reason to watch this game Just rmr Im basically still in college No, youre in medical school Cant wait until youre complaining about taxes in 18 months Brock what's the steaming sitch for nba games this year Does reddit work anymore Buff streams?? Buff stremas Fo sho Chad send me your discord username Theres a discord server that people post links to Buff is good tho I also heard that r/adamsilverfanpage has replaced r/nbastreams but have yet to confirm it for myself Just checked page does exist But it has 40k members very worrisome What's a discord Cats already out of the bag and season hasnt even started yet Chat app Chad not good at technology Nerds use it for team speak for world of Warcraft raids Is there an app for that Dont know from experience someone just told me about it Discord app is great for illegal streams tho I'll give it a look lol Honestly rooting for a mediocre (if even) eastern conference nba has been like the most fulfilling sports experience of my life Alright going on record with a few predictions 
- CJ makes his first all star team 
- Zach averages over 10.5 pts & 7.5 boards (bet with space)
- Embiid plays over 64.5 games (bet with Dubov)
- Portland finishes with 50+ wins 
- Portland makes it to the WCF
- Giannis wins MVP
- Chris Paul gets traded to the heat https://twitter.com/pftcommenter/status/1186448457919356928?s=21 PFT has a galaxy brain https://twitter.com/trailblazers/status/1186365583572402176?s=21 Gunz who is the digital team babe at 2:22 Shes like the only person that I dont know or have never met Wow. Mysterious. That video was cool but like whats their tiktok strategy? To placate their Chinese owners? We at the blazers really love Tiktok but we really love the fact its owned by our Chinese friends Wait blazers owned by China? Tik tok Hey Brock eat my ass! I took 7 unders in Brocks pick em. So hip Those are all pretty good predictions chad Blazers WCF will depend on their path Imo Agreed West seeding is gonna be nuts. 3-7 could all be within a game of each other ? Cheeky parlay for SNF/MNF Gundy that Jordan quote makes me so happy lol Im dying bro MJ is so petty lmao https://twitter.com/stadium/status/1186490242817282048?s=21 I wish we got more interviews from him. Greatest player ever and he barely speaks I think ESPN is about to drop that massive MJ documentary soon Its gonna be like the OJ doc kinda from what Ive read. More a mini-series than a doc I dont think its out until next year Yeah 2020 But thats not that far now That's gonna be epic Whatever happened to the jail blazers doc? Quick said the guys didnt wanna do it with HBO They wanna do their own movie where they have creative control So its probably never happening lol Weak God dammit This astros locker room drama has taken an interesting turn https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/wes-wilcox-on-play-off-predictions-portland-la-and-lebron/id1225356682?i=1000454272373 Trudeau takes it. ?? Good piece on the blazer Brock what was the line on Trudeau Wilcox called Zach one of the best defensive bigs in the league Dont remember Ill tell you when it caches tomorrow. Bovada wont display all my opens ?? Brock and his futures! Its how you never run out of vada cash Running out of cash on bovada is my favorite hobby I do not feel good about my O/U at all. I do not feel a repeat coming. I think Im leading the NFL that would be a sweet repeat but its too early to tell Wow this chick had some next level shit in her tinder bio Everybody want to eat my ass but nobody want to take my ass out to eat Merry Christmas, brothers. ?? I fully support this name change mark Oh baby I just set my lineups Nothing says all in on fantasy basketball like betting big on Cedi Osman https://twitter.com/adamschefter/status/1186599521796677632?s=21 Seems like a lot for Sanu Yeah he can still ball tho, I guess other contenders were willing to match or something Im loving this. I have Sanu on my fantasy team and his value just went up I got AJ green lurking on 2 of my teams if he ever comes back ?Found Ian's burner Lmao the Blazers social media team is getting dragged by Black twitter for being NBA social so white Oh yeah theyre getting crushed Just wait until people find out that all their favorite sports teams Social are run by whites Oh yeah its all happening ? Never forget lol Back when the gun emoji caused all that violence I mean they probably shouldn't have an entire team that's white They should definitely hire a diverse team. If diverse, qualified candidates apply. Idk if you know this about Portland, but its no Milwaukee when it comes to diversity. Gotta be intentional about diversity cmon man If they apply is a sorry excuse The rockets could repair a lot of damage if they release the same video but the entire social team is just Chinese Whats the solution Chad? Recruit diverse people to come and work for the team Its quite simple I 100% support a diverse work force but Ive hired people on multiple occasions and its not as easy as saying find me the best diverse candidate Find people who do good work. OFFER THEM ENOUGH MONEY TO CONE WORK FOR YOU Where are these super talented people? ? I get a massive stack of resumes. I go through it and pull out the ones that are *actually* qualified. Its usually a very small subset. Should I instead google search every single resume to see if theyre a diverse candidate and just pull those? Do you know any hiring managers that have time to do that? Klay done for the year I mean if theyre hiring managers isnt that part of their job? The hiring managers job is to hire the person they feel is most qualified to do the job I think what Dubov is saying is diversity is not a problem the average person in a company can tackle at all On the other hand We get 70000 applications a month at Nike I guarantee there are qualified candidates of color in those applications some higher up at a company should find a way to get the qualified diverse applicants resumes on that persons desk Most positions at Nike go unfilled for a while because hiring managers dont have time to sort through resumes and interview candidates It doesnt help that our HR function is incompetent Ive sent back batches of resumes because there werent any qualified candidates The issue specific to my role is that there is no diversity in sports social. There is one - I repeat, ONE - black social manager in the NFL. Shoutout to your Detroit lions Spaceman The problem for Nike is we dont have entry level/coordinator social positions. The minimum experience Ill look at for a specialist under me is three years. Where are they getting that experience? My team is fairly diverse. Two asian guys, a black woman, a black guy, a white girl, and a white guy (hey ???????) but we all got experience elsewhere first. It's falls on the hiring team itself and the organization as a whole. But it starts from the top down. Companies need to proactively work to create an inclusive environment, and then seek out those candidates who may be qualified but aren't aware of the job/finding the company. Get out to universities across the country, speak in under served areas to promote the work you do etc. Sitting back and saying we don't have any diverse applicants isn't an acceptable stance If that's the case, then teams/orgs need to think about "okay what are we doing that's not attracting a diverse applicant pool?" Not saying that all falls on one hiring manager Dubov. But it's a concerted effort as a whole that needs to happen Ill stick with the Nike example since thats the one I know best. They basically take a few routes to hire. 1) online apps. Least likely way to be hired. 70k applications and software is searching for keywords and IF somebody checks the box on race thats factored in. Still, most people who apply online arent qualified - regardless of race. Next is interns. Those are put forward by the schools/athletic departments at which point Nike filters through the resumes. Decent amount of diversity there. Probably more than any other route. Word of mouth - this is how you get the most qualified candidates, but not necessarily diverse. This is how we found the last person we hired in my old role. Black woman that came from Georgetown basketball. She knew the purpose marketing manager really well. Had no idea she was a diverse candidate, but her resume was good enough. Not great, but good enough. She wasnt the most qualified candidate we interviewed but she was the most passionate for the job. I would be lying if I said we hired her for diversity. We hired her because she was the hungriest of the candidates. I guess my question to you chad, is whats the order of operations? Guaranteed we attract diverse applications in a pool of 70K/month. But should that be the first criteria? Im not sure this is the right comparison though? Lol Nike wouldnt put out a basketball related video featuring only white staffers, theyre smarter than that lol I mean ethics aside, youd think a team that essentially doing PR could anticipate the obvious backlash lol Again, I disagree. Theyre a product of their environment. They work in an overwhelmingly white industry and in an overwhelmingly white city. Its like a double bubble. Not like the gum. But you get it. I talked to one of the guys in it and they didnt even wanna do it Im not defending the video, I just think its really easy to understand how it happened The Warsaw program at Oregon is one of the best sports marketing programs in the country. Its almost all white students. Why? Lol I mean I grew up in the northwest too, I definitely see how it happened. Im also white! Youd just think with all the conversations happening rn, youd be a bit more self aware. Were talking about two different things, youre talking about actually changing the ratio and Im talking about not being oblivious dumbasses lol. Thats fair Youd just think someone would raise their hand and say this isnt uh, the best look They lost one of their black PR people this summer who may have been like uhh lets wait a sec *their only black PR person There have been multiple people in the territory offices at Nike (LA, Chi, NY) who have turned down roles at WHQ because Portland is too white. Yeah Portland is like 80% white, so obviously companies are going to end of reflecting that Im having a conversation with my boss at 10 about hiring a specialist under me. One of the things Im going to ask HR for is a diverse candidate pool. Unfortunately, the only POC I know in sports social are vastly over qualified for this position. I always reach out to the Warsaw program director to see if she has any recs, but its always white people. Yeah, any luck recruiting outside of Portland? The woman we hired in my last role came from DC I mean a lot of people that work here are from other places but they arent necessarily diverse A lot of white europeans for sure My VP is South African One of the sr. directors is Italian Lol I was in an interview one where they told me one thing working against me was their diversity quota It was a little more coded than that lol but the message was clear I feel like every higher up I ever met at Nike was a white European/argentine/Aussie/South African Lol Except for like, sports marketing guys who are almost all black Pretty much Gundy Also the one side of this that people generally just pretend doesnt exist is that unless your company is rapidly expanding, changing the ratio prob means doing quite a bit of laying off i mean I think we can all agree this isnt an overnight solution That may just be what it takes But people dont like to talk about that part lol Itll take years, likely decades to get to a diverse workforce Yeah Idk Dubov these are all great questions and I by no means think I have the answers haha. I'm just saying that recruiting a diverse workforce HAS to be an intentional thing. Whether that's successful or not depends on tons of other variables. But being aware of it, and making an effort to recruit those of color is a good start Its a whole societal thing too But gundy makes an excellent point about any representation matters. The one black guy who could have spoke up and said something and brought a different perspective to the video creation and perception, isn't there anymore. So you're left with a bunch of white people who don't have that difference in viewpoint or life experience to say something We need to stop requiring traditionally wealthy white credentials for these jobs. Yeah totally that happens in advertising all the time especially with casting, where I just wish someone would call the client (or the agency) on their shit Or at the very least feel uncomfortable about clearly excluding black actors for a role Yea I think qualified is the operative word if the industry is whitewashed you have to break the standards. Hire good confident people and know that you can fill the gaps with training and on the job experience Exactly We need to stop devaluing credentials/experience that isnt traditionally wealthy and white One other thing on the point about POC not wanting to move to Portland Dubov. It's kind of a chicken or the egg thing but that's why it's important to have a diverse/inclusive group to begin with in helping recruit others with diverse backgrounds because someone of color from the south probably isn't gonna want to move to Portland to work with a bunch of white people in a place so unfamiliar. Does your company have employee resource groups? Black excellence, latinx, etc where they can find a community within the org. Does your company actively talk about diversity and representation? Those are all things that can proactively be done to help in the recruiting and attracting a diverse applicant pool Lol I mean companies these days are pretty good about talking about these things, we have like 8 meetings a month. Not sure theyre so good about actually administering it Lol I'm not talking about sitting in a meeting saying "alright guys we needa be more diverse". I agree That happens all the time without any results https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2019/09/representation-matters.html "Talking" as in things like this. Doesn't necessarily have to be a huge event like this but salesforce is a great example I mean Portland is sort of an anomaly Like its demographics No matter what, as long as the city is like 77% white or whatever the workforce will somewhat reflect that Yeah and that totally makes sense. There's only so much they can do. But as long as the effort is there, that's a great start But cities like Chicago which have more black people than white But if you just sit on your hands and say "well nobody applies" then you're not doing your part Yet in the corporate world its all white leadership I think nike does a pretty good job in terms of the Black Employee Network and hiring a chief diversity officer who is responsible for obsessing details related to diversity I feel like WK is also very good about that And I get the whole qualified crutch, but I dont want to discount the value of somebody who knows what their doing. *theyre I need somebody who can come in and own their work right away. I usually dont apply for an intern because I dont have time to train somebody. I dont care about where they went to college or even what company theyre coming from but they need to know digital and social strategy inside and out. And chad Im not digging at salesforce because this is most companies, but every agency Ive ever worked at had big meetings/conferences/initiatives like that but go look at the executive team on the salesforce website and 9-10 of them are white. Ehhh salesforce is pretty fantastic about diversity, gender equality and donating to help those less fortunate Right, but the leadership team is what it is, no? But again, its an easy fix. 

Portland should call the lions guy, ask him what he makes, double it + relocation. Then tell him to call his network Its great to have well-intentioned white people! But this is sort of thing, every white person thinks theyre the exception. What does that fix, Mark? That just relocates him and pays him better. That doesnt infuse more diversity into the industry. Doctors beget Doctors I think mark is joshing you! Nah Im all for throwing money at the problem Were trying to solve the worlds problems here, Mark. Also uh Idk anything about Salesforces workforce but my uneducated guess is that big shiny tower in San Francisco probably is filled with a lotta white dudes in Patagonia quarter zips. Lots of Brad (Shultz) and Chad (Butler) types Relying on the private sector to fix this Historically Probably isnt the best solution I dont envision any public policy solutions coming out of Washington any time soon https://twitter.com/brittrobson/status/1186691245701287936?s=21 Look at this rube I love how Utah and Denver are just both unimpeachable teams according to the basketball intelligentsia. I dont get it on what planet is phoenix going to finish behind Memphis I took the under on both of them! ?NBA scout on the blazers Chad butler on the blazers? Haha no I woulda hyped us way more Lol in the notes app Some of the best content of all time has been written in the notes app actually Lol screenshot from the website didn't fit in one page You guys saw that at least one NBA GM (and it cant be Olshey) picked Portland to win it all? Something I was thinking about yesterday, is it possible dame and CJ could both average 25+? I feel like CJ should get more shots than last year. Especially with Nurk out https://www.slashfilm.com/gemini-man-box-office-failure/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf#targetText=The%20film's%20worldwide%20total%20is,financially%20anyway )%2C%20and%20Aladdin. Lmao no way who could have guessed it Will smith lost his magic touch Or just takes shitty scripts Bad Boys 3 will make us forget his past crimes against humanity (After Earth) Anybody want to guess the three countries Nike sponsors for the Olympics? Russia, China, Iran Brazil US China Trinidad I wish, Mark. China and USA? The holy triumvirate Its the USA, Kenya, and mighty Estonia. Lmaooooo What is Estonia nice at? Being forgettable They got hot women Weight lifting True story Some of yall never watched Metrex World Strongest Man on espn when you were a kid and it shows Where is Marius Puninowski from? Pujinowski* Thats the only worlds strongest man I know For some reason I thought Petteri Koponen was Estonian but hes obviously Finnish. Lol Gemini man was written by the game of thrones writers. Fucking hacks Lol the guy that fucked up every part of game of thrones not related to the books? Yup Damn, he did write 25th Hour though Great Edward Norton flick Lol east guys Easy Thrones wasnt going to succeed the way you want on that timeline No one can write that how you want and make it work God I love NBA opening day for bringing us a Petteri Koponen reference Those guys did an amazing job. Also if you havent read City of Thieves, check that out. Its a dope ass book Benioff wrote. People forget that Ton Siragusa plays a Ukrainian mobster in 25th hour!!! S/O Spike Lee for the casting The Goose! No they didnt Clayton Youve got to be kidding me That writing was so cringe And They also reduced the number of episodes they did Weird how all the seasons based on the books were amazing and the minute they had to make up anything it sucked Have any of yall scene The Foreigner with Jackie Chan? I just watched it last night was reminded how much I love Jackie Chan. How many gen z kids do you think only know Jackie Chan in reference to that shit tiesto/post Malone song? God I dont even wanna think about that. Way too many than am comfortable with probably Rush hour 2 Top 1 movies of all time Brock I also think your expectations are just too high Its never going to be exactly what you want post novels I also think you put that original story in someone elses hands and that part couldve been more fucked up. Theres two sides to this and what those two did was amazing. Nope they ruined it Of course it sucks they rushed the end, but thats because tv shows just shouldnt last past like 5 seasons. Actors and show runners get tired of doing the same shit. Every single detail of the show got appreciably worse Lol okay there Ebert ?Text from my dad ?????? The last two seasons were like if they had a fan fic contest and picked the 8th place winners script Thats quite the take I think most fans of the show agree Sounds like you really cared about the books too and Im a bit less biased on this. Im a like not love in terms of Thrones overall, and I see the fact that no matter what they were not going to please everyone. They just didnt have enough time to do it right. They did have enough time! They literally chose to do less episodes than they were budgeted for So they could do Star Wars Yes they wanted to be done Therefore they didnt have enough time Changing ur name in my phone to grundy Event the actors wanted to be done No one wanted to keep making it lol Okay you dont get extra credit for quitting early and turning in a bad product Brock so you just were unhappy with the way it got there the outcomes? Def not unhappy with the outcomes of the story The writing was abysmal I can agree the way it got there. It was rushed. Like they just didnt want to world build through another 4 seasons They wanted to do 15 eps They wrote a scene were theon gets in a fight and he wins because a kick to the balls didnt affect him Shes muhh queen no matter how it ended you and the big time thrones fans were going to bitch. Thats the best part here lol None of the characters had any motivation for doing anything they did Not true Game of thrones season 7/8 were trash Totally agree with the motivation, again its because they said fuck it we are doing 15 eps The council thing at the end was the most contrived shit The writing was bad because they had to Oh got it ? Its not like the writing was bad because they all forgot how to do it lol Thats why I am not hating on the writing team or Benioff and Weiss Again it was their choice It sucks but I remember hearing after season 6 everyone was tired of doing the show https://twitter.com/adamschefter/status/1186716765084094469?s=21 Actors, show runners, probably everyone except the writers lol Mark how stoked are you Watch the actors reactions when they ask if the finale was good Theyre all like ehhhhh They all were ready to move on too. The main ones at least who had options aged After Well go see gemini man and tell me how the writing is Clayton this is a tough hill to die on lol I dont need to see Gemini man. Yah Im not out on a limb here Will hasnt picked a good movie for a while That also didnt look good And its not just Benioff on that script, there are 5 people which is a major red flag for a film ? Thats classic Wow agree with Brock all the way Season 7 was so goddamn awful that the writing was on the wall but WE WERE BLIND TO IT and then season 8 is a big ole dump And yea, Emmanuel sanders will be dope hopefully jimmy g throws it more than 6 yards to him He and Goodwin have to be the fastes receiving duo right? Fuck game of thrones. Thank god for succession Don't let benioff and Weiss anywhere near succession Did anyone watch premier of watchmen ? Worth watching ? Not yet but Im v excited Lindelof the goat Matt Im interested but waiting to get the go ahead when the season is over Its gonna be very woke Think the golden compass could be entertaining As well Im not into graphic novels will I still enjoy watchmen? Theres some good YouTube videos I recommend watching as well to set you into the world Lindelof is creating You should read it Dubov its crazy Dubov yeah hes actually just placing it in the world of watchmen but its completely on its own storyline But read watchmen its a staple Its not meant to be a reboot or sequel or anything https://collider.com/watchmen-hbo-ratings-series-premiere/ Apparently it did well Yeah Watchmen is dope. I actually dont hate the movie but it wasnt going to be a mainstream success Seeing it in high school was top 2 highest I've ever been at a movie ever slightly behind avatar 1a and 1b Hows west world doing? Couldnt bother to watch after s1 Still good imo The African American actor , Hopkins and Ed Harris are all phenomenal Jeffrey Wright It was awesome Mark Parker is no longer CEO starting January 2020 Who's taking his place John Donahoe I was hoping you weren't gonna say president xi Who's Donahoe Bain, eBay, ServiceNow Oooh tech guy huh Were a tech company, Chad. Here comes the diversity!!! Anyone want clippers +4 https://twitter.com/leonknight_/status/1186712105879293953?s=21 There was a pretty strung out looking subway preacher type yelling about how he was being directed by Pope from Italy and getting really animated. And then he just kinda snapped out of it and said but religion is not for everyone. So take it or leave it. Im calling bs on the biggie phone Hey Im about to take off I want clips +3.5 Any takers? You got like 3 mins Up to 50!? https://twitter.com/jemelehill/status/1186459971484930048?s=21 Jemele has us in her crosshairs Dude this is rough lol people are killing Portland Kaepernick to Blazers digital team confirmed You know who was the biggest winner of it all is Brooke Oldzendam I don't think she was featured in it, dodged a real bullet there Lol That Jemele tweet is what started this all The comments on the original video were also all about how white it was Man Id be so annoyed if I was in that video Im white so I dont want to give any opinion on this No matter what Im wrong Like I want to say is there really that many people of color/women qualified for these roles that applied for them in Portland, a very white city as is? Couldn't be more wrong than ur game of thrones writing take , take a shot But I wont say that Ill just say the blazers love white men Idk, seems like a massive cancel culture incident again. Heart is in the right place for it but god the execution of it just is mean as fuck lol https://twitter.com/TheDJRello/status/1186295638834798593 Alvin Gentry going with the ol 12 man rotation game 1. Bold move Yah Clayton i agree very mean People should be required to take a test before getting access to scooters Lol Powell 30 footer is not what I woulda drawn up I feel like that's a scenario where Nurse should've just let it fly after the rebound. Why set it up for a trash shot like that. Especially with Siakam our Out Idk if this was posted earlier https://www.instagram.com/tv/B37cqvjJPeq/?igshid=fk521k00llum Am I crazy or is it stupid to use a coaches challenge in the first quarter of the first game Instant impact Moe Who is this Moe Harkless I missed the NBA. I did not miss Reggie. Reggie is a dipship He sucks Dipshit I'm honestly not just tryna be contrarian but I kinda like Reggie Landry Shamet is so fucking sick I fucking love the West Its honestly going to be NFL-levels of competitive every night Yeah shamet was a nice get in that Tobias trade Does that give the ECF winner an advantage? If they can coast through the season, turn it on in the playoffs and catch an exhausted WCF winner? Perhaps, but the ECF itself may be a draining battle unto itself Those teams are elite Yeah for sure I think it definitely does. First 2 rounds will be a cake walk West winner could have to play 3 7 game series but if youre in the west and have to fight every night just to get good seeding thats tough Thats why I disagree with the notion anybody in the West can do load management without consequences Portland wont load manage That matters Yeah exactly Yeah we can't afford it. Houston won't either Doubt Denver does Dude I think Jokic is a real candidate He was spent in China TRUE That BK ad read was super weird. Did Reggie just cream his pants when Kevin said cheesy tots? Im glad Im not the only one who noticed I LOVE NBA BASKETBALL! Danny flame thrower Carrying bron on his back Oh shit! Chantal Navarro spot?! Howard still a bitch Quinn Cook allergic to open looks https://www.instagram.com/p/B38p4SsAxJx/?igshid=ztc1vrxgku7a If you read Ballmer's lips he yells "board man gets paid" lmao Ballmer is the perfect owner for Kawhi Just two goobers goobin it up Boardman to a board man https://twitter.com/RealSaavedra/status/1186798814339821568?s=20 Players only meeting in lakers locker room after the game! Hahah Nice little teaser tomorrow night.

Pat Bevs intimidation tactics dont work against elite guards https://twitter.com/edsbs/status/1186872221458980864?s=21 ^^^ new team logo Looking forward to seeing Jamal Murray disembowel Jim Him And I dont even like Jamal Murray https://twitter.com/magicjohnson/status/1186874578653442048?s=21 NBA the best league and ITS NOT EVEN CLOSE Its the content Wedgies* Lol Kawhi gets wedgies* https://twitter.com/espn_macmahon/status/1186870277931700225 Damn siakam and van vleet dropped 34 a piece Siakam has 18 boards Mvp! Toronto SUPER OVET OVER Our queen believes https://twitter.com/taylorrooks/status/1186889130816356352?s=21 We have me, Chad and Taylor believing in the Blazers. IMAGINE betting against us ? "if their two best players go down they're not good" Show me the Lakers w/out LeBron and AD or rockets without Harden and Russ lol Or the raptors without siakam and van vleet Wow their depth is bad beyond that Great take, v useful Lol that's such a terrible take from buddy. You can say that about every team in the league Guys, accept true fate and join gundy myself and our goddess t rooks on the right side of fate Dont worry, Chad. I already punched a one way ticket on this bus to Irrational Town. finals or bust. Fuck yes https://twitter.com/NBCNews/status/1186996403488333824 Does this mean pornhub will load faster So that's what Cam has been building this whole time God bless him ?Hold up. Moving to Texas Only 30 minutes north of Houston But think of all the snow you will miss Chad Am I fucking crazy for thinking Hood, Baze and Hezonja will be better than Chief, Mo, and ET? Like we watched them all year and theyre fun in the regular season but once playoff comes around those three guys became irrelevant. Im just tired of scrolling through fucking Twitter and seeing people dog the Zers. Not crazy at all. I completely agree Everyone on twitter saying that didn't watch more than 2 blazer games last year Dumb question: who is going to play the 4 off the bench. Is Hezonja big enough for a small ball team? Also blazers -1.5 ?? of the century? I think Hezonja will definitely play a lot of 4 on paper. But handle the ball while out there Tolliver will prob get like 10 minutes of run a game too All my la friends last night asking me about why we let Mo go. I told them to keep an eye on him this year, hes streakier than your windshield after a homeless man windexs it at a stoplight. Couldnt be more bullish on the blazers this year. Once Nurk is back fucking look out world. Finally some depth at big man. THE MOMENT WEVE BEEN WAITING FOR SUNCE THE EARLY 2000s! I think well be really good this year but I dont expect Nurk to come back any time soon or be a serious contributor when he does I dont expect him to put up big numbers but I expect him to push some big boys around and get some boards. Beast has the most heart in the team Even if he comes back after asb that would be solid for us in our playoff push Excuse me. Finals run* https://twitter.com/cheftrillie/status/1186995896006987776?s=21 For Ian If the blazers win it all this year, Im moving to Milwaukee I'd be surprised if Nurk is back by March https://twitter.com/Dame_Lillard/status/1187035958211792898 I have actually blocked off my calendar as Dame Time in the past when I have to leave early for a blazers game lol Took blazers ML -115 First step to winning mvp: get your own This is SportsCenter commercial ? Does anybody here use YouTube tv Nah they dont do Pac 12 Gotta do sling because of it https://twitter.com/maxwelltani/status/1187026971575902208?s=12 lol Ive got a buddy who is pretty techy and he enjoys it.

Such bullshit btw, rumor is Salt Lake City won the 2023 NBA all star bid over Portland Dubov what do you do for ducks? Especially basketball Hope that the fans have fun drinking 5% beers and not being able to drink hard alcohol all weekend. Not to mention the players lmao What a lame choice Yeah its $50/mo. No contract. Unlimited DVR and every channel I want except P12N. I dont watch Ducks football at home so thats not an issue. Ducks basketball is the only thing I cant watch but I coach in the winter so I miss most of those games anyway. For the ones I can watch that arent on national TV, I try to find an illegal stream. Cool thanks for telling me @fbi For real Im such a noob about illegal streams and just realized how great reddit nfl streams are for me when I cant get rams on sling/other apps This is the best one right now imo https://home.nflbite.com/ Has nba also Yeah I'm thinking about going to YouTube tv and the just adding HBO Yeah I think Im gonna go to YTTV too since they have NBCSNW And Comcast doesnt have league pass this year lol Yeah that's ridiculous. Does China own Comcast? You can add league pass on YTTV I think too Stranger Things drop tomorrow OH SHIT Yes you can add LP on YTTV And Showtime ? YouTube TV + Ripping shit is the best Chad can confirm I was 100% against cord cutting until I moved, now Im all about it ? These tho Lol Aye aye captain ! Blazers are fucking legit ?

Besides nurk Just pau Hmmmmmmm Time for Zach Collins to eat Jokic has been on the bench all game and we're losing. Not good I feel like Im watching d league or East basketball Its like a heat hornets game Okay take it easy it's not that bad Yeah I don't like the 5 scrubs at once Z easy don't do it to em!!! Is that Hakeem or Zach Collins?? We got a battle Completely forgot about Pau Playoff pau* Our bench cant shoot like what do we do if CJ nor dame is in I love Zach Pau's biggest contribution this year is gonna be teaching Ant his way around a wine menu Zach and Chad > Brad and Chad Rember when the whole warriors team wanted to fight Zach lol Man hood and baze cant hit anything Simons needs to be in dunk contest God they are on fire Anfernee is deferring too much Adefernee* Pau looks like an assistant coach He looks like a sommelier Paul Allens sister is such a fat cunt She prolly loves Hillary God what are we doing Tell us how you really feel Dylan ?We should add Donovan to the group chat Strong candidate for sure Whiteside double double in 10 minutes ?? Going for 20/20 in his debut I can't wait for the stat. Hassan whiteside first blazer with 22 points, 18 rebounds, 3 blocks and 4 sips of Gatorade in a home opener since 1984 lol Bazemore is wild on D Baze is ballin on defense I like our defense Denver just shooting 3 ball well and we need to stop with the 2002 rip Hamilton ISO pull up from 20ft shit We need to get Rodney in a hoodie so it's hoodie hood The people's champ :( This is nuts 18-Dec They have to miss and we have to make one eventually Dame is so streaky Trash call by the opposite ref on that charge Good news: Whiteside has been good! Hes been flat out better than Jokic tonight Bad news: we are losing! Doris playing white player descriptors bingo with Zach Lmao Im listening to music what are the comps, aside from Kevin McHale of course "he's tough he's smart I love his competitive spirit" ?????? Murray is hurt and Jokic has been ass we better win Ambitious shot from simons https://twitter.com/worldwidewob/status/1187215482883063808?s=12 Favorite tweet of the night Hell yes Ant! Attack! Conley went 1-16 in his Jazz debut. Woof Season first lowlights edit ! Trade Whiteside start Skal Can u imagine how good we'd be if we had melo Or any wing who can knockdown about open three If we had Ryan Anderson were a lock for WCF So guys The Michael Porter Junior hype Pretty weak! Hezonja better tbh We have to capitalize against this line up ??????? Wait what You gotta smoke weed to believe in the blazers Everyone knows this You cant pick two teams for the 8th seed I'm LOLing at the king's picks And that Stephen Jackson forgot the Jazz completely They just got RUN by the fighting Robert Sarvers tonight ? I totally forgot Baynes, Kaminsky and Saric are on the suns this year. What a weird roster All going to be more tan than they've ever collectively been on their lives Vampires in the desert Scary Harris Fuck Welp Whoa Zach Someone open a door ? Need a bucket here Do or die There we go Fucking Dave with the jinx Fuck He jinxed Whiteside too Motherfucker And that's all she wrote I'm getting blood fantasy points from jokic right now I don't want them!

Full rebuild. Whiteside 19 boards tho Pretty dope Also pretty dope for my Zac Collins bet Maybe if hit 3s we will win Just saying its tough to win in 2019 shooting 25 percent on 3s Man to think we could have used all the time we spent blathering about simons talking about Kendrick Nunn! https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=bEoBDACnl6Q Glad you guys beat up on the worst team in the West! Congrats! Space I was thinking the opposite. My Collins bet looks great He's only gonna get better 19 bench points :( Eh youre missing the lead here Our rookies looked great in week one Collins did look great Nunn is just on a shitty team. Empty stats Yeah its all smoke and mirrors Trash contributions in garbage time of a nothing game Wut lol They both got the start How did phenom Simons do tonight? The Grizzlies, according to my own friend who works for the Grizzles, are the worst team in the West. M Maybe in the NBA You think him and ZC fetch Kawhi? Congrats u beat up on a g league team lol Yes but we should read into simons huge performance against a bunch of backups? You best Ja Morant and Mississippi Valley Comminity College *Community Summer League Champs Come one I thought gms were lining up after that performance? Which one is it? They played a good team, shot poorly and lost Welcome to the West Im sorry but that didnt answer my question? Youre question is disengenois Just saying by your logic, anfernee Simons game is a total mirage and means nothing right? Yeah were not feeding the troll tonight Lol wut *disingenous Explain that Youre only concern trolling Lol thats not what concern trolling means Yes it is At all Youre faux worried about what this means for Simons and trying to gaslight the group. We good tho. Wut Thats not what gaslighting means either dude Or even close If Simons was playing in your game hed have 25 Asking you to apply the same logic equally is not concern trolling or gaslighting You are not asking us to apply it equally Stop concern gaslighting us Concern trolling would be like if I was like oh youre so concerned about the blazers losing, but you arent talking about the blazers Twitter scandal, how much do you really care about the community Gaslighting would be like actually the Grizzlies were really good last year according to so and so metrics and making you guess yourself If youre gonna barf our buzzwords at least know what they mean Ehh, it could also be you got so excited when guy played well but arent upset with him when he shot poorly? Hypocrite much?? Its a combo I fundamentally disagree with what youve just said (Space not Gundy) My definition of gaslighting or concern trolling? By your loose ass definition you could apply those terms to anything Im just saying, you are phrasing things out of a concern we arent being honest And its complete horse shit Not being honest? Simons also played against the best bench in the nba What youre saying is Im not allowed to be excited about two rookies performing well in their first nba game, no? How's that starting center position for ya Really bad! Im not full of shit! Youre the one telling us we have to be mad At simons Wut? For one bad game When you say which one is it isnt that what you mean? The only thing concerning about the Simons performance is the fact he played 12 mins What Im saying is herro and Nunn balled out in game one Who is Nunn And if that happened with any blazers player You would rightfully be excited Ok I thought you were telling us to ship Simons off to China Are you saying you dont talk shit? That Im alone here? Because he had 5 pints Lol Nahhhh you knew what I was saying. Now youre gaslighting. U said we blathered about Simons that was uncalled for https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1187222295556874241?s=21 This is gaslighting U could have just celebrated ur rooks instead of disparaging ours in the process Yes I agree with Matt. Uncalled for But u couldnt allow urself to do that Act like youve been here before jeez Lol Im sorry I hurt you with the term blathered We didnt say ANYTHING mean about any of ur players Uh, been where before? Especially meyers The blazers are pretty likely going to have a better season than the heat, if Im the only one not allowed to talk shit I might as well leave the group and join back next June lol Ur good just dont concern troll and / or gaslight All good I just felt my son Anfernee was targeted and I couldnt stand for it Sorry for being agro https://www.instagram.com/p/B3_QP-4AUeH/?igshid=1kmdppy3v3ri6 Bothers me how much run this is getting Im sorry too Gundy Its opening night Emotions are running high I am sorry *group hug* And Matt I will agree to forget everything ever sent in this chat unless it turns out to be correct And then I will never under any circumstance let it leave my mind for a second Lol Im kidding now not just redirecting my anger toward Matt WE LOVE YOU GOD https://youtu.be/RQ8nytXs13U ?(Gundy when u disparage his precious Anfernee) Lol also Lets just get this out there Use it as a pejorative all you want But I am by definition a troll But ur our troll Yeah I like how quiet you were the whole fucking game And if you expect me to ever stop harassing you when the blazers disssapoint Then you slither out from under your rock Cave* I need you to go ahead and just give up on me Were all just actors in the grand play of life I mean Im in Puerto Rico rn my phones been dead all day Everyone had their role Has* Just got back to the Airbnb Wow sick brag Also Im the only active person in this chat who doesnt root for the blazers Oops, sorry just reverting to my aggressive state Its second nature Yeah space you ruin our echo chamber I want irrational exuberance only So call me what you want lol, but yeah, its not like you guys are lacking is ideological reinforcement here Also Gundy, thinking about it now you could make the concern trolling case lol not sure about the gaslighting one But Ive got a beef with that term lol Like I get it means manipulating someone into believing that they cant trust their intuition Do you hate Lauren Duca for making a career out of gaslighting? Me too. But if it applies to like encouraging someone to second guessing what they just said Isnt that just making and argument Lol yeah I mean everybody hates Lauren Duca now Never be famous lol Removed a laugh from Then you slither out from under your rock But I will say, one pretty key element of concern trolling would be like... even sort of pretending Im concerned Anyway, for another day! Its gonna be a long season boys! Buckle up The Heat are 1-0 without their best player Ian wins the chat for the day But the line has been drawn on slandering Penny Simons Even perceived slander Lol unless he does prove to be kinda meh and then you have to answer for it.. and by answer for it I mean shrug and move on. Honestly tho Thoughts on whiteside a debut? I mean the line was pretty sexy But thats always sort of been the knock on whiteside He was good until two bad close outs in the 4th and Jokic making shots on him That like when he does well the team does bad (always seemed unfair!) Jokic couldnt drive on him at all but hit two big 3s That was kinda the change in the game Hassan legit played well and was making the extra pass on offense too Probably woulda had a few assists if we coulda made any shots Yeah I mean like He was 6-7 with 19 boards lol Thats pretty crazy Hes not the reason we lost, we can def say that Yeah, bench was trouble and McCollum shat the bed One of those two things is worrisome McCollum will be fine Also Denver is good and its game one lol Bazemore was awful offensively I dont wanna see Tolliver Im more than 45 games tho *in Hes a specialist, not an every game player No start for dragic And thats with jimmy and dion our Out Am I missing something? Why are the Pistons only -1 vs theHawks tomorrow? Hawks are the NBA hipster darlings The hype machine loves them Why wouldnt they be? No griffin Pistons arent good Tre young? Luke Kennard ha; 30 tonight! Like its not like its bucks hawks *had Oh no Blake? Ok thats why Drummond 32-23 lol Ah yeah So yes Im that case Im bummed about Indy, I thought theyd be better tonight You were def missing something Oh Im asking you lol yeah gotcha Pistons are a playoff team with Blake. Hawks are trash. Indianas bench made Portlands look good They need dipo back Yeah I mean the hawks are getting better The pistons are a barely 500 team with Blake I think they are still a year away from being in the playoffs Atlanta Yeah or longer At least Warriors-Clippers tomorrow should be sick Unfortunately gonna miss it but its gonna be a great game Got Kim Petras tickets for tomorrow night Oh wow I didnt even see we get Giannis vs. Harden tomorrow too MVP showdown Yeah I prob wont get to watch a full game until I get back sub night :( I prob wont see the game but Ill def look forward to the highlights I dont give a shot that we beat the grizz, Or even that much about how will our rookies did Im just pumped That they got major minutes And appear to be a part of the gameplan I honestly hate how you guys find rando wings who arent terrible on offense and play good defense Its like, the most mind-boggling heat thing Its been 3 years of wade/dragic iso ball and missed corner threes from Winslow/Richardson/James Johnson/luol fucking deng/etc Yeah its kinda a chicken or the egg thing tho Like I dont think Rodney McGruder gets any run in Portland Yeah thats fair Props to Dylan, the Atlanta cocks are off to a rip roaring start Lmao just read that Jim Boylen had a punch clock made where the bulls players punch in for practice For how much they pay people on ESPN it's pretty sad how little they actually know. Stephen A just ranted for 5 minutes that the sixers are idiots and shoulda buckled up and paid the luxury tax to keep Redick on this team They had to renounce his rights to sign Horford. So it was an either or. They never could have had both. Dumbass ?Good Morning Liga and Troll. Ignore the foggy window ?Jeff Garlin is all of us this morning Im on warriors +2 if anyone wants the clippers $20 Mark What time is the game? ? Im seeing 1.5 but Bovada could be different Line is moving! Its 1.5 now I got the ML @ +110 its even now Ill take you for 50 at 1.5 Cool?

You bite your tongue yes Ian BUT I probably wouldnt get in now Oregon vs Oregon state , osu is the safety Vs Yeah thats fair UW is real tough to get in WSU is def the safety side But yes UO is a safety school WSU is just a bunch of corn fields and parties. I've met 2 people from there and both dropped out Yeah pac 12 rankings by not being a safety school 


Stanford
Cal
UCLA 
UW
USC
Colorado 
Oregon 
Utah
Arizona
Arizona state
WSU
OSU
 Maybe usc over uw but its easier to buy your way in I think youre being a little unfair to OSU I dunno who would you put them over? Probably WSU but ya Oregon on downs kinda tough. Whats the def of safety school for you? B flat student in high school gets in I feel all schools have programs that are towards the top of their fields but maybe asu is the winner then. I feel u can get a 2.8 and automatically get in still I actually have no argument with that list UCs are def the hardest to get in. Hence the abundance of Californians at Oregon B flat average in high school is pretty good... Idk isnt there like 50% of classes that are auto As? I was barely above a B average in high school and I got into all of my top choices Which were Boston University, Northeastern, and Emerson I work in higher ed and I can tell you its a mix Didnt get into Syracuse, though. Fuck the Orange. A big reason students go to Oregon is because you can only get 8 credits a semester at UC schools It takes too long to graduate The other side of it is that it is harder to get in because of that same ratio of students to instructors Some schools also just have higher standards boston U average high school gpa is 3.7 Oregons standard is much higher now than it was when I got in 2008 when 3.0 was automatic acceptance ASU also has like 80,000 students. They let anyone in 2009 it was 3.25, 2010 it was 3.5, then it was gone altogether Yeah The 3.0 auto accept was so ridiculous lol asu also does that because their ecampus is one of the largest in the country They can service all of those students with enough credits each semester The auto accept if I rmr correctly was only for in state kids It may have been Houman, but for out of state it wouldve Been even easier They want that out of state tuition True Legit the only reason I went to Oregon was because auto acceptance I assume they have to accept a certain percentage of in state tuition in order to keep funding alive Yes Oh and they loved the out of country Asians and Arabs lol Yeah that $$$ is even better for the university Yeah when I saw you didn't have to write an essay I was like "boom. Done. Applying to college is easy!" Isn't Oregon like 50%+ out of state now? Wasnt writing no essay Or paying for any applications I didnt need to I started writing an essay for UCLA and then gave up after 5 minutes and applied to Oregon I need a copy of kimbles essay on why you should drink whey protein instead of Gatorade Haha holy shit I forgot about that space ?? Dunno what to tell you, Brock ??????? They let my 3.3 ass in They were willing to take my 55K per year And Oregons auto accept was lower than a 3.0 our application year. For my year it was 3.2 So thats a safety schhol Or 3.25 It was 2.8 I think Because I rmr I barely made it No thats wrong Yeah youre right cam Cam youre a yr head of me It was like 2.75 or 2.8 Im talking to myself Houman Like I applied to a bunch of schools I had little chance of getting into (Stanford,cal) Lol Then a few like usc, ucla, uw that I did I guess my question is does money factor into being a safety school? And then Oregon because in case I got rejected at all I was auto in I somehow got waitlisted at uw with a gpa of 3.2 I didnt know what colleges were even in existence outside of Oregon Cause I didnt consider Oregon a safety school but I also didnt want to pay that much for college Thats wild Houman, I dont know anyone that got into uw with a 3.2 Diversity ??????? I only applied to 3 schools; Oregon, WSU and Tennessee Why Tennessee? Which one was your safety school Id say Oregon is a safety school. 
Like Portland state is a commuter school. Oregon is a safety school and uw is a top tier school I will say their orange is the best orange It comes down to how much their name means in the country. Thats how I would clarify safety I applied because of our elite sports business program okay. It got me a great sales job selling software Just because you got waitlisted doesnt make UW the best Houman The terms depends on the group that is talking about it Uw, cal, ucla those are all top tier programs in the country But lets be real it doesnt matter where you really go in undergrad i guess I would argue WSU doesnt even qualify for safety school WSU is just happy to be here Honestly after I saw the out of state tuition costs, it narrowed it down to Oregon and Oregon state immediately. And then j chose Oregon cuz I didn't wanna be a loser the rest of my life It was a pretty easy decision WSU was my safety school I kinda always knew I was gonna go to Oregon My dad went there and we made fairly frequent trips to Eugene I dunno Tennessee just sounded fun and different I mean cant we all agree that we are all glad we went to Oregon? 100% can Cam I went to the campus tho it was kinda uglyespecially compared to UO Wouldnt change it ever Oh shit I didnt know your dad went there space. Thats dope. Yeah Ians dad told me a story of how he took a shit on the pioneer mothers lap in 1983 My fam is glad I went to Oregon as well so they can justify their outlandish fandom outside of just living in Oregon Apple doesnt fall far from the tree Jk I made that up Well fuck that would have been a great story Haha I was gonna say that doesnt really sound like my dad Maybe we make that story a reality this weekend? He did tell me he let a homeless guy sleep in his dorm when his roommate was out of town Ok cam I will call my dad Tell him I need a favor Hahaha Didnt mean your dad specifically Lotta drunk bros gonna be in eug this weekend. No I know Im kidding lol Oh and they homeless guy shit in the urinal What a boss This is the world the democrats want Matt youve been awfully quiet... did you enjoy your experience at the safety school you went to? Lol Portland bros. Where is a good spot with decent food and beer where I can post up and work until all you hooligans are off work? Marathon Taverna And by decent food and beer I mean $2 breakfast and $3.75 personal mini pitchers of rolling rock. Is this place also a strip club? not usually Hahaha Lol my association with rolling rock is it getting read aloud both in court and during my multiple student conduct meetings after I got arrested Hahaha My association is quarter beers at the nile Otherwise I would say 10 Barrel, Breakside, Tope (rooftop at the Hoxton), Wayfinder, or Ecliptic If its not raining a gaggle of bros are gonna rendezvous at Revolution at 2:30 Dubov my new favorite description of a bar is "not usually a strip club" Great notion is the best beer in PDX and the food is great NW and NE locations Jeter is trying to sell the Players Tribune. I wonder how much of that he actually owns God is there anything more gratifying than watching the warriors get throttled like that in their home opener? 81-1 starts tonight Anyone got an extra ticket for WSU? J Rose was selling on one of Gundys tweets Also like the clippers dropped 141 And their top scorer had 22 points They dont even need Paul george to be the best team in basketball Yah Ian its possible that this season is not even close to wide open and in fact just as much a foregone conclusion as any other I mean its only been two games but yeah, I think the clippers are clear favorites For the cord Ive been saying this for months so dont say Im just reacting! https://twitter.com/nate_mann13/status/1187773053410799616?s=21 Lmaooo must win! If we go 0-2 we're fucked! What if the Warriors are also bad? Lol Record But for the cord is some great accidental copy That I will now work into my vernacular going forward I didnt see the game lol Hahah must win The warriors are very bad gundy I watched most of that game Was Steph flustered? For the cord is great Steph was fine but they're playing with guys named Poole, Paschall, Robinson III, Spellman Leandro barbosa ain't walking thru that door Shaun Livingston ain't walking thru that door The warriors defense is gonna be an issue Dont @ me Charles made a good point too. Steph will score 30, Russell will score 20, draymond will score 15. Where's the other 45 points coming from Yeah lol the things is the slippers can play like 11 dudes Lol Lakers 6 seed clippers 1 seed Yeah I dont think they should trade for Iguodala Clippers The clippers dont need him It would be dope though Imagine having Iguodala, PG and kawahi on the floor how do you score a basket? Honestly WE should trade for Iggy Dont you think we need another shooter? off the bench? I think Baze will truthfully shoot better I would love that gundy but we don't have the contracts And Tolliver. They are both above average career shooters They just missed everything in Game 1 I mean Baze works right? Yeah if we wanted to trade Baze that's the only way it works That's a small upgrade tho. I'd rather keep Baze and his bird rights Im just saying we should consider that option Crazy how were half a week into the nba season and not one Oliver Maroney tweet has been shared yet Try signing him cheaper next summer If Baze struggles Fair https://twitter.com/omaroneybig3/status/1187772523187859457?s=21 ?????? I like Baze a lot tho. Iggy has like 30 games of basketball left Say what you'll say about him at least he's consistent Lmaoooo Where's the receipts Maroney! He's the Jacob Wohl of nba Twitter "I was telling people at a hipster coffee shop in LA that Zubac was the best pickup at the deadline" ?He sure never tweeted that take Hey chad it appears TikTok is hiring a head of culture and diversity I think this is my opportunity to make a difference Lol the irony here is we definitely engage with Maroney more than like anybody else I always wonder how hed feel if he knew a random group chat made up of people hes never met is fully dedicated to bashing him lol Stop gaslighting Maroney Ian Space quit concern trolling maroney https://www.sfchronicle.com/warriors/article/Yes-even-the-Warriors-get-San-Francisco-sticker-14560779.php This article is nuts Glenn Robinson is renting a 2 bedroom next to the salesforce tower for $7,900 a month.

God its so annoying Im like trapped in the Bronx rn lol bc moving somewhere I gotta lay first last and brokers fee So its like 7 grand cash upfront Jimmy out again? Shams said baby then deleted the tweet I'm sensing some drama Like Jimmys GF had a baby but dna tests show Waiters is the father Please not sexual misconduct please not sexual misconduct please not sexual misconduct Is the Kanye album good I only consume cultivated content Maroney said he's thoroughly impressed with the album.

Oh fuck yeah Their fries are also amazing Are people boozing in Portland tonight? Can you guys hear that? I think turner is getting close Cam do you only send gif's now instead of email attachments? I send a lot of gifs For sure ?Can you try slipping this one into an email next time? I think I can find a use for that ? Clayton you didnt tell me they were waffle fries! Oh yeah dude. So good Ill tell you the blueberry muffin sour is the goat. Not too sweet either It also legit smells like a fresh baked blueberry muffin. Double stack also is a good taster, its a stout but worth a try its an award winner. Might give it a shot but I am a big hop guy. If I could drink a straight hop that would be preferred. Okay good to know. Look for their Juice Jr, or anything DIPA They also use the freshest ingredients and only make small batch stuff which is why you cant buy it in any store, only at the location. ^this guy is so portland Haha that's what I said ?Lmao Wow thats some awesome core product GN is the best Im not ashamed. Ive never been Sounds like a vibe They got ice cold CL? Damn only thing missing actually I would prefer every brewery also carry c lights Even can form would be fine Amen I love a tasty, tasty craft brewski but sometimes I just need a simple refreshment. Like cool Ill have 2-3 crafties but then can I switch to c lights to really catch my buzz? K so its official Jimmy had a baby You came out? Oh wow At first I thought you meant peck and I was impressed he hid it all from us https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.miamiherald.com/sports/nba/miami-heat/article236618248.html Lol imagine coming out that way I feel like if I was gonna come out Id try to be nonchalant about it I know theres been some speculation Hey fellas, fyi Im gay But Im here to make it official Also guys I was front row for Nick Kroll last night and he murdered. That special will be good when he films it. Honestly Id prob just start dating dudes and let everyone else figure it out lol Oh wow Ian that is even better actually. Some people probably wont just come out and ask too itll just fuck with everyone Yeah lol, I mean I think with this ever evolving gender discussion people are just starting to date whoever makes them horny and identify with it a little less Also Ian are you a Sturgill guy? Been meaning to ask this group as a whole but I know youre a big music guy Lol no but ask Housman Houman* Oh no I dont want him to be a fan ugh Im sure hes got some poor take on him and I feel like its just gonna upset me Who the hell is this guy Lol Your takes are ?? what can I say Im asking because when he announces tour dates I wanna see him outside of PDX because I think hell play the Schnitz again which is a terrible music venue Oh wait this is something different Oh god hes country music. Clayton I know thats youre thing and you my take on country Yeah I dunno Ive never listened! Hes not even really country music Your thing and you know my take on country * His first album was, after that its been a wide range of stuff Yes I do Houman and thats fine. Is the range from nickel back to Kenny chesney Lol no Or are we talking about odexza to Kenny chesney Yeah this is kinda fun, seems self aware Lol his newest album is a dub step country rock record amd he also created an animae film on Netflix as a visual album I approve lol Woahh. Now you got me interested Its absurd dude I got high and watched the movie and it kinda scared me His second album was all about drugs, mainly DMT His third was about his son, then this fourth album is just so crazy its awesome ?Pitchfork approved Oh yeah critics love his shit Sound and Fury is his new album, he sat on it for two years while they made the animae film Also hes super big on the idea that when he tours he cant play the songs the same over and over so he changes them up a lot and they are so different. Okay thats my Sturgill stan session. Fuck He already played Brooklyn this tour Yeah thats fine he has a new tour coming in Feb His opener is a really good singer songwriter too named Tyler Childers and Sturgill produced his album. Lol Leicester is beating South Hampton 7-0 in like the 60th minute 8-0 now Sturgil is great Also not country music He made a cocaine 80s synth album accompanied by a 40 minute anime If thats country music my name is Sally Perkins Synth rock** Genres are a bullshit construct man! 9-0!!!! Houman Im gonna fly to New York and punch you in the face for asking if Sturgill is like Kenny Chesney Dubov. Sorry to break it to you but idk who ethier of those ppl are Im so triggered right now I know Kenny Chestnut I love getting people triggered But please refrain from using automatic weapons Tyler Childers was just in Portland but it wasnt with Sturgill unfortunately ?*loses internet for 2 hours* OH wow I didnt even see those and Ive been plugged in to chat today Who the fuck is Kendrick nunn I didn't touch the group name tho That's odd It's all at 3:03 iCloud in Mexico is different I guess ? Also Jimmy Butlers baby mama is allegedly KATs Ex Dylan how long does a hazelnut tree take to produce from seed being planted Until it produces a nut? No wonder the wolves didnt work out until we harvest? or like until its fully grown? Also fun fact. A hazelnut is technically a bush and we form and train them into trees. Wow Thats messed up man Thats wild Or I guess, not wild Lol They stay healthier and live longer that way Until you harvest Like planting to profiting We harvest year 4 I told a coworker 15 years then thought wait that can't be right sometimes 5. Im legit blown away that a hazelnut is a bush Kk lol thanks Break even is year 8 Profit isnt for 9 or 10 years and market conditions obviously vary greatly Thank u I always try to avoid spreading misinformation when discussing Oregon big ag 15 years they are fully mature I could produce so many nuts in 15 years Take it easy Kevin spacy they peak at 25 then plateau there production. Provably top 3 most sustainable crop. Sequesters a shit ton of carbon and produces oxygen Soil is undisturbed so less erosion.

I feel like a win would separate them further from Oregon and LSU with 1 loss still has better resume. Well they both still have to play bama I think we want LSU to lose And then both to lose to bama Yeah I agree with space Then it's Alabama Clemson Ohio state or Oklahoma and one loss Oregon Also were hardcore Utah fans now We need them in the top 10 for the pac 12 championship Finally watching the blazers. Love Terry rewarding Hassan for his grunt work in the first half by starting the 2nd half by running a play to get him a deep post touch Spoelstra would have never ?? Man its wild dragic is coming off the bench Woah I didnt even know that I know lol nunn is the starting pg Tho I think its like a Manu situation Yeah Id say so lol Or is Justise the PG? Do positions matter? I mean nunn is listed as pg But yeah Also Tolliver my god. You are not prime Ryan Anderson Hes shooting it the second he catches it! That's the problem with some 3 point specialists. They think they have to shoot it every time they get the ball in order to provide value The one he launched from the top of the key and air balled was so ill advised He also made some not very veteran mistakes on defense. Maybe hes just nervous trying to make his mark on the team but I expected more savvy from him Yeah I'm hoping/guessing his minutes will be taken by a mid season trade or buy our candidate in 40 games This seasons Hood/Kanter https://twitter.com/ClipperNationCP/status/1187755491436519424?s=20 Goddamn butler missing the game against the wolves God imagine him just going at town rn So cruel Chad my ultimate homer hope is that Nassir takes Tollivers spot That would be amazing. Terry needs to just throw little to the wild He's always so hesitant about playing rookies Hezonja has also been butt He might need to brush up on his Chinese Thybulle and Grant Williams are already playing major minutes for Boston and philly Let it rip https://twitter.com/samesfandiari/status/1188098171521470465?s=12 Christian Pulisic hat trick! Are we gonna talk about the bucks/rockets? Giannis has 30-13-11 Pretty dope https://twitter.com/chelseafcinusa/status/1188150530243289088?s=21 I didnt see the game really Ian but I am looking forward to watching Milwaukee today I also wanna watch RJ Barrett today We$ is starting for Milwaukee Houston and Milwaukee both looked pretty dangerous Oklahoma in a dog fight ? Funny space cuz I thought Houston looked like pretenders Eh I dunno, Milwaukee is pretty damn good and they were up most of the game Yeah idk. Just seems like the same team they've run back year after year Except this year they have Russell Westbrook? Terrible knee injury in Oklahoma vs Kansas State game Do not watch Do not mention to you know who Appreciate the heads up Will avoid at all costs Probably wont watch TV this week just in case Lets go k state Im looking forward to seeing Houston tonight but Im bummed out Jrue holiday is hurt for that game Bye bye BigXII When has Westbrook been conducive to winning tho I don't think it's a major upgrade from CP in terms of wins The best ability is availability! Westbrook will show up to work more nights than CP3 Oh for sure. But I don't think it's a move that catapults em in the playoffs or anything Same book different chapter Also I did not expect Oklahoma to lose but god damn that helps us a lot haha Dont do this to me Jason its too early for this! ? I had a feeling but it was wishful thinking Lol 2 games in and Quick gets a boner I can relate Whose all going to the game today? KSU baby! I will be there ? Smoking a deer leg today, wish me luck Wow that is graphic Murderer! *snowflake voice* Holy shit Mark You savage I usually only get that level of graphic on cam hanes instagram page Ok auburn! Their running back is a load https://twitter.com/nothinbutaction/status/1188151805110173696?s=21 On a serious note I was considering Miami +11.5 Thinking about parlaying all the dogs tonight in nba ? Bo Nix is a gamer baby Ugh the bucks are rough Im hoping for some garbage time for Miami to cover 11.5 lol Lol that was a bad bet Heat coming back baby! Led by Kendrick Nunn obvi https://twitter.com/chelseafc/status/1188170348677734400?s=21 Content day most social media managers only dream of, just printing impressions at this point. We got this cover baby! That guy kinda looks like chad I can see it Ian I'm pressed with this game Even scoring output And Meyers is -8 while the team plays well. Win win ?What a chain of events to follow Sorry for the jinx space Yeah that shit was crazy lmaooooo Hahahahhahajahaha Wait fuck! ? Wowowowowow Cant wait to hear why this one doesnt count! What yall got? #bucksUnder I got nothing lmao Chad? My 5-team parlay is alive! Gundy you took the heat so youre clear Cant wait to hear how Milwaukee isnt good and the rockets are just worse from the man who picked the rockets to finish 1st 5 days ago Lol why would I say a heat win doesn't count? Not everyone is out to getcha I think Milwaukee is the best team in the east and the rockets are pretenders.

Well I sure hope he was, Brian Omg the Suns lol Siakam came back down to earth a little bit but he still got 19-6 Man lol The kings look really really bad Anyone who beat them should just push that aside and focus on getting a real w Luke Walton getting exposed for the fraud he is I mean didnt he completely fail, get fired, and then get accused of misconduct in like a year? Anyone who had expectations.... its kinda on them lol Lol yes It's just funny how some guys get anointed as the next big thing and it takes like 4 failures for people to finally change their mind I bet he gets at least one more HC job after this Lol I know it always reminds me of this clickhole article https://www.clickhole.com/a-master-strategist-steve-bannon-has-completed-his-yea-1825122394?utm_campaign=SF&utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium=SocialMarketing Oh just a reminder We beat the fucking bucks tonight sans jimmy Wtf was that defense on both those plays Suns beat clippers Power rankings are a social construct Literally going to be the definition of the clips season Beat the lakers and lose to the Suns.

Disaster Herbert yikes I can't believe we don't have a dude who can kick a 50 yard field goal Lol I knew it was coming clay This staff just wastes Herbert lol It hit verdell in the hands Its not even his fault the guy doesnt even get a chance to get into a rhythm Also yeah but thats tough for a small back to reach up over his head in pads It was fine tho Yeah it could have been a better pass for sure Not a fan of that play calling on the first 2 Oh no. Pac 12 refs How was that PI??? What the fuck Should have let him score We'll get a stop Interception to end it Okay match the fuck up This is gonna be because we missed the extra point Nah Stop here Yikes Fuck Should have been offensive PI. That was a 30 yard swing Good thing we have a killer kicker Go for the end zone. Our kicker has no balls My PTSD says wide by 15 yards Cristobal going to play for the field goal We all know it Throw everyone off and go Verdell draw here Please god This would be peak Oregon if we missed a 20 yarder lol Score a fucking touchdown Yeah throw the ball Go end zone We got a Timeoit Just let Herbie make a play Verdell swing out.

Utah probably beats us Oh we dont play Utah till pac 12 Were fine I think Utah is a better matchup Than Wassu Similar styles we struggle with that air raid shit Gotta get pressure tho on d if we cant then we will lose to good teams Well prob start as the biggest dog in college playoff history It would be so rough if we got in Theres no like notre Dame this year ?Look at these jive turkeys Thanksgiving is close ???? What is fournette pissed about? Lol that he tried to cut back from the 1 yard line Dumb ass run The bears Oh no Haha Omg please tell me the Bucs scored And thats gonna stand Bullshit! Refs gonna ref Second time this season they've done that Sanders! Mark how hyped are you Super bowl Man Tannehil is making Mariota look worse 2-0 as a starter Wait The warriors are down to the thunder 70-37 at half What All you that picked panthers +5 ? Serious question, why do people think Kyle Allen is good This guy is a freaking bum! When you look up game manager, it's a picture of Kyle Allen D-Lo just got ejected for the warriors lmao Damnit fantasy implications Remember when everyone was penciling the Browns into the super bowl lol Kyle Allen was only good because cam was basically disabled If cam is healthy hes better But the niners are just flat out sick Steph sporting a -30 rn warms my heart I got talked out of browns under in brocks pick em and Im upset They're prob missing the playoffs ^ that was for the browns but applies to the warriors too Maybe mj was right! Charles certainly was ?????? ? Is Brock starting fantasy b-ball off 0-1?!? ??????? Kyle Allen no longer allowed with 500 feet of Santa Clara Schools after exposing himself against the 49ers this Sunday Removed a laugh from ??????? Love having tevin Coleman sitting on my bench today I was 98% projected to win one my games today. Then the guy I'm playing had Edelman and Coleman play Gundy I'm bout to hand you your first loss Suck on that comish Nick Bosa, who was the jabronis they were saying to draft over him? Yeah I need Jaren to ball out But even then Im
Done Damn Mark, have a day in fantasy today 167, we aint done yet From 1-3 to 4-4 ?Its cool CJ signed some autographs for Maroney pregame If the warriors keep sucking will they trade draymond? Space what do you think he'd fetch? Hezonja straight up? Gary Trent and a first probably I dunno they might as well hold on to him and wait to retool I dont foresee him handling losing very well They should trade D Lo for more parts. Spread their dollars out more evenly Like get Teague, RoCo and a first or something from minny Right now their top 4 guys puts them at the luxury tax We get scored on too easily Seth Curry revenge game hood is ballin Need Boban to play Need it Tolliver is garbage God Porzingis really is a unicorn He is playing lights out Also playing against him in fantasy ?? Fuck you Dubov! I might change my fantasy team name to that FUCK YOU DUBOV Hahaha Sooooo Kendrick Nunn has 18 fir at half points and 4 3s... That is awesome! Its too bad his talents are being wasted on a non contender Is anybody else's Espn app not working or is it just me Mines working Wtf Mine hasn't been working all day This is how you become a contender, not something youd understand watching the blazers reng! When is Pau supposed to be ready? I think like another month DUBOV Wow idk why that was all caps https://twitter.com/orlandokgw/status/1188621517816381442 Shit He popped that shit Just a dislocation yeah? So a week to recover? It depends on if hes had it before If he has had multiple ones then its a short recovery. In normal ppl time its like 1-3 wks. But if this is his first then 2-5 weeks. But then again these players dont go by normal standards lol Dr Mirtorabi with the expert analysis Only reason I know this is because I saw someone with it this week lol And I asked the doc Robinson with 15 space. I concede Really need a Heat win and Wolves loss here. Double whammy. Okay gundy how long til we cut bait on Tolliver. -15 in 3 minutes Kenneth Faried is available. We got shootahs Yeah tie game with four left What a shitty call That happens every play I dont think Ive ever seen him get called for that lol Omg Wiggins just went Kobe on us lol 11 straight point Hit three threes in a row Touch foul smh Holy fuck That Wiggins run Lol Ugh Well Nunn with 25 for the game! Mummy back next week Ill take the 2-1 Omg That was on baze Terrible call Fuck CJ got me hard Who's gonna make me cum That Defense!! I'm ready! CJ iso time What defense by CJ, Baze and Mario Wow Two for one? I'd do it Fuck yes DAME DOLLA Yall already know what time it is Calabro getting a little sexual "just like he's been doing all night. He puts his head down and then the explosion at the finish!" Challenge it! All ball! Hand is the ball too Is a player not allowed to tell his coach to challenge? Yeah idk about that. Never heard that before I guess Wow No collision? *collusion The first big time challenge I like this challenge stuff As long as it goes our way lol So if they overturn they inbound? I think so I think it's a jump ball Center court Oh interesting Same as an inadvertent whistle Did nobody from Dallas pick it up Good challenge Low key Center court? Interesting I believe so Didnt know you could challenge a foul?? Hell yeah lets go New rule Oh yeah baby. That's the main thing coaches have been challenging Its weird Charges and stuff I wish fans could challenge coaching decisions Kind of a quick foul call eh? Challenge! No foul! Lol Great foul by Dallas though Fuck yes!!!! Suck my dick Cuban!!! Helluva win! Can we challenge that foul? No only 1 per game lol Wow THJ almost got that His daddy woulda made it Woooo Lets gooo I had an uncomfortable amount of money on this game for a Sunday Holy shit Dallas shot 50 threes lol Holy shit Tolliver is awful ? This season is gonna have a record setting 3PA count By a wide margin The lakers tho might prevent that single handedly Hope Zach isnt too fucked Gundy can we get Faried or someone? There's better 4's out there Lol Lets go get jimmy butler Im ready to fleece Miami again Dante Cunningham Amir Johnson https://www.instagram.com/p/B4JEs-uhjsU/?igshid=1s9b79fh7393p https://twitter.com/Politidope/status/1188627772786298881 Holy shit Thats awesome So my buddy put $50 in Bovada on Thursday and turned it into $17k this weekend I will be trailing him from now on ? Filthy parlay ?Booger getting trolled cuz he said Nick Bosa isnt an elite athlete Mark for more context he got the initial deposit to $150 did a parlay to get $400 did a solo bet to get $800 then a solo to get $1800 then just started rolling it Hit 14 of 17 bets Wow Thats like the famous space run of 2016 Lmaooo Thats wild. http://vm.tiktok.com/m1ctXV/ Oh this is who cursed Zion. Time is a flat circle Incredible The Carushow!!! Ive cashed out of bovada 2 weekends in a row What a bizarre feeling Lol Mark how that deer carcass turn out? Deer is pretty good! A little gamey But tasted way more like beef than I expected I dont even know what that means ^ libcuck Wait wait wait. Collins got hurt tonight? Dislocated shoulder I think Fuck Theyre currently making Anthony Davis Allen Iverson comparisons on lakers postgame Huh? ? Hes a point guard in a big mans body AD? More like AI out there today Paraphrasing but that was the gist of it lol The Dwight Howard redemption arc is also in full swing I just saw a Dwight is theon tweet lol What is dead may never die ? Cuban is angry tweeting I feel like the nba wants to show how theyre way woker and more progressive than the nfl so theyll overturn a lot of calls on coaches challenges whereas there hasnt been a single PI challenge overturned all season ?Heyyyy you guysss https://twitter.com/alexkennedynba/status/1188846635444559872?s=21 Oh fuck blazers play again tonight Space appreciation tweet Who's getting the start at the 4 tonight gundy? Hezonja? Always shocking when nab rolls around again. Like wow theres actually games every damn day The ol Texas two-step. It has to be Mario Or the wild card nassir It absolutely positively cannot be tollive Tolliver Terry does love a good young guy vanity starter Play 12 minutes all game but still start Yes The Noah Vonleh Memoroal Young Guy Vanity Start Memorial* That'd be kinda lit. Throw him out there Actually we are totally missing it Skal is totally gonna start I want nassir But Skal is probably what terry will go with Putting nas on LaMarcus would be a tough ask For a first start Is whiteside not gonna guard LA? They've been starting LA at the 5 and Lyles at the 4 so far Oh word? I thought theyd been starting Poeltl Yeah Poeltl only got 15 min off the bench both games so far. They've been going small Forbes, Murray, Derozan starting Oh yeah then we should totally start Nas! Fuck trey Lyles lol Can't believe Denver traded Mitchell for Lyles lmao Denver would be the hands down favorite if they just kept him Oh god Im gonna save that tweet to trigger Denver when Gary Harris has a bad game Hahahaha yes They also drafted Gobert and traded him to Utah IIRC. They should probably never trade with Utah again lol Lol wow Snyder is their bellicheck. If he wants the trade say no ?That ain't it Chad doesnt it seem like Tolliver is like 0-20? Praise the lord hes only taken 4 field goal attempts Yes. He has literally done nothing positive Really?! Wow. That's an impactful 4 misses Maybe this is a BBref typo Really sticks out in your mind It cant be real Lol I also bet he's taken less than 4 dribbles. Dude just launches every time he gets the ball He's also -30 in 27 minutes this season. Is that good? Ok it is real Hes been awful We need to trade for Draymond What does draymond get in a trade? I'm not even gonna propose anything due to my blatant homerism Some NBA cap nerds are saying this warriors season would be perfect for the NBA to have a loan system like soccer lol Like imagine just getting to rent Draymond and make a run at a title For one year The flip side of course is then Steph would be on the Lakers lol https://twitter.com/dame_lillard/status/1188854106217222144?s=21 This is why Melo doesnt want to come to Portland https://twitter.com/art_stapleton/status/1188868325067149312?s=21 Lol Real savvy Lol do most rookies give the reporter a secret recording of the entire meeting or something https://www.instagram.com/p/B4Kl0CCBkQq/?igshid=1qwku506k85nv Look at this fuckin bum Nope just Meyers https://twitter.com/max_olson/status/1188866388556955648?s=12 Hahaha there's no way that is real Seriously? No idea lol I can only hope It is real Its real That's wild https://www.complex.com/sports/2019/08/high-school-athlete-decoldest-toevadoit-crawford-goes-viral https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/19/style/high-school-tiktok-clubs.html?module=inline Does anybody want to join my tiktok club after school? Do u have a minority stake in tik tok ? I fucking wish Apparently their head of NA marketing went to Oregon. Can somebody explain what Tik Tok is How is it different than vine Its not really The in-app editing capabilities are better But its basically the same concept More music focused So it's just another fad? How long does it last Its not going anywhere Hmmm seems unlikely My old man take for the day Get chad the anti Meyers content he needs to get sucked in I mean its already been around for a couple years already Its massive in china and then they acquired music.ly which was already mega popular with a younger demo Did they acquire music.ly or just relaunch it with different branding? I thought it was the same people all along Great question. I thought ByteDance bought music.ly The TikTok parent company No clue Quick bit of internet research. ByteDance bought music.ly for a cool billie and merged it with TikTok Also. NBA loan system would suck Not a fan. Idk it would be kinda cool for teams that are tanking to rent out their good players without losing them for good. But Im also saying that as someone who would love to rent Draymond while Nurkic heals lol And potentially if Zach is out long term Im sure Id get really mad when Philadelphia rents Steph or something risk of injury is too high Btw I hate this fucking review shit in basketball Yah but big picture Player movement is destroying fan allegiance to franchises This would do even more damage Spaceman I think the reviews will cool off in a bit. Every coach is just trying to figure out their strategy. No way coaches cant help themselves lol Thank god teams only get 1 per game Even if they get it right Stotts has low key killed it with the challenges. Got a foul on Zach taken off with it against Sac And dames foul Which was massive Im anti-replay but if its gonna be used teams should be able to take advantage I guess youre right in the sense that right now there is no incentive for coaches not to use it They should implement an accumulation rule. If you get a few wrong in a row you lose it for the next game. The league needs to invest more in quick reviews. Why are the refs at the game doing the reviews? In any case I think they did that with the automatic reviews Should be a HQ. fast as fuck. But the coach challenges are still handled at the game Oh theres a challenge? No problem someone has been looking at this play already lets ask them Like foot on the line, out of bounds and stuff Also more sensors. Like if someone was touching the ball or not or foot on the line should be solved automatically already I dont know how the balls arent chipped yet Of all the things they track I'm a big fan of the challenges. But agree with Brock. They need to be way faster. It's absurd the in game refs have to fire up a monitor and sit there and chat for 5 minutes Also they should have someone in the booth or HQ make the call. Remove any perceived in game bias from the refs on the court ? Final 4 seems likely. Rose bowl matchup ain't happening Our path isnt exactly easy But a 95 rose bowl rematch would be sick Our playoff fate lies in Harbaugh. Can he finally beat Ohio state? Im not thinking playoff. Im thinking can we win out and go to the rose bowl. And I probably wouldnt bet on it tbh Why not think playoff? It's in play Its definitely a possibility I just love getting let down if you can't tell But we have two, maybe three games left that a very tough to win Im not confident that we win out @USC, @ASU, and maybe P12CG vs Utah or USC again I'm feeling good about our chances. Gonna be an interesting finish Watch us win all of those games but shit the bed vs Zona I was impressed we pulled it out Saturday without Troy dye Kinda wish Travis dye could transfer his health points to his brother Someone needs to give Travis some gloves before he gets another carry USWNT hired a coach. Vlatko! Who is that! He was the Reign FC and formerly FC Kansas City coach. Won a couple NWSL championship. Players love him. Nice https://twitter.com/realgm/status/1188921669311696896?s=21 Im LOVING the dialogue Also loving Phoenix at home +4.5 v Utah We are getting 6 at spurs I dont feel good about the Zers even with the 6 No Zach is gonna hurt Idk how we survived last night 3 in 4 with two being really close Man looking a dames games played each season What a god Yeah he's an iron man He's played a full seasons worth of games more than AD. Same draft class Oh shit Danny Brown is in Portland tonight ?? That crowd must be... eclectic For a Portland Danny brown concert This chick on the jump said KAT is the mvp favorite so far. Where do they find these analysts lol It's been 3 games fam chill Sounds like a real gaslight move ?5 teamer tonight ?Went 7 teamer on the ML Im all aboard the action app by the way Great product! Ugh just saw Gus Johnson is calling the Ducks game this weekend against usc Oh lord Whats USC ML??? Yeah I love it Im trialing EDGE. Its ok. Gus is good news. Just have to prep for another nail biter tho Tolliver made a shot! Wow we are fucking Mario hit a 3! Great end of quarter possession! Love that look! Skal with the board and putback dunk got me hard Hezonja stepback 3??!? Lol I realized I sent this in the wrong group chat Shea Serrano can suck it I sent that in a fantasy football chat , theyre probably confused Read your fucking roster sheet spurs announcers. It's not Simmons smh Omg Simons the kid https://www.instagram.com/p/B4Lun74gxDT/?igshid=1a78zsooz626s Collins what is you doin baby GET OFF THE TRACKS!!!! Baze His defense is better than Moes More consistent More energy Whiteside wanted no part of that 15 footer My baby bulls have lost two games to the two worst teams in the league in embarrassing ways ?? Yeah Im fucked on my bulls over lol Lol panick season already I tried to warn you about Chicago! Gundy you and Dylan are tied in the nfl ou 
 For 1st? God nfl genius Erik gundersen at it again! Yup Haha hell yeah Lmk when its madden time Gundy Like I dont think the bulls are a playoff team but losing to the hornets and Knicks?! In the final minute?! https://twitter.com/chargers/status/1189001838554562560?s=21 Looks like we are running out of gas Yeah this is the back to back taking its toll http://weakspell.com/ this site has really high quality sports streams by the way Juju ? Good look Dubov On the streaming site LFG DAME Lets goooo That was the most candy ass foul call Ive ever seen Classic CJ move Fuck you Tolliver!!! Come on he had to take that Yah that was his shot on DET Wow So many good looks for tie God what a heartbreaker Just glad I didnt turn it off haha Fucking Tolliver still pissed me off. He was wide open He's a specialist Thats true I guess but cant give dame a pass then - those shots are essentially wide open to him too Oh for sure. But he's hit plenty to deserve a couple misses lol And Tolliver didn't have a man within 5 feet. Was stepping into it. He's just worthless https://twitter.com/anthonyvslater/status/1189014025813872641?s=21 God I hate draymond. Don't wanna trade for him anymore Chad needs someone to hate now that Meyers is gone . Anthony Tolliver step right up Lmao Sorry Tolliver. You left me no choice Man I dont even know what to say about the new Kanye But use this gospel fuckin slaps https://open.spotify.com/track/0oPOuDmmkVp3h6puekhs6P?si=vd7vYKaoSyG9XTK3q2xJ9g lol or ESPN just slowly transitioning to being the mainstream gambling network Bc you know when its completely accessible nationwide Every fucking casual sports fan is gonna gamble https://twitter.com/royceyoung/status/1188980412380581888 Damn I was one bad minute from the Bulls away from a 7 team parlay hitting So whos gonna watch Jimmy tomorrow night The debut! Chad ur gunna wanna sit down for this one ? Meyers is like that kid that graduated from high school but still stops by at lunch periods to see his friends that are a year younger. Like we get it dude, you used to go here. This is weird. Omg Chad! Pleaser enter the liga! Hahahaha wow what a convo to wake up to My two arch nemesis ?It's a god damn blizzard out here boys Wow thats gnarly Damn. Def prefer that to fire My new coworker went to Marquette. My first question after meeting him so how much more cultured is Portland compared to Milwaukie? ?Next guy starting today is a fuskie They are destroying deadspin https://twitter.com/barry/status/1189224064788979712?s=21 Nooooooooo Goddamn our fears are confirmed I wish I had a stray billion dollars lying around to set them free Shit man it would probably only take like 20 million at this point But again I dont have 20 million laying around Such trash man Damn it ?More dumb Espn talking head takes. "Nobody talks about the Rockets bench. This is a deep team! They have Eric Gordon.." What is this bench you speak of Omg The bench has been Westbrook lmao Hes been a monster When you actually listen to what lots of these guys say, they're pretty dumb takes lol And hes making free throws again Makes you really appreciate a Lowe, Russillo etc. Guys who actually watch games and aren't just prepping arguments for tv https://twitter.com/diannaespn/status/1189228220278640640?s=21 Adios red rocket I didnt realize deadspin was still cranking away. I thought they went bankrupt or something They got bought by somebody and they just published yesterday their bosses told them to stick to sports which LOL if youve ever read deadspin They will forever be known for breaking the manti teo news Yeah its pretty funny they are posting zero sports related stories now They also coined the phrase stick to sports so its pretty ironic Or at least a poetic death https://twitter.com/cbssportsnba/status/1189233399975895042?s=21 This won't end well lol Plus like whats the market for another site that huts posts spirts news? There isnt one lol Yeah I know it honestly seems like a shitty business move All my podcasts are advertising for the new cbs sports network We stick to sports! No politics!! Okay ill make sure not to check that out thanks Lol god Deadspin created its own lane its just so wack man Guys lets turn the liga into the next deadspin and take on barstool Wow the NCAA just said fuck it Let kids make money Go Ducks baby! Bronny James Oregon Ducks point guard!!! Wait for real? im still holding my breath Like will they allow it but regulate it themselves? Too bad Bronny gotta get to the league ASAP before lebron retires In a manner consistent with the college model bullshit What does that mean https://twitter.com/hamiltonnolan/status/1182310343332245505?s=20 https://www.sturgillsimpson.com/agoodlookntour dont forget to pre-register for presale Deadspin going hard in the paint right now on the website Yeah I know Theyre full on striking lol, its the end, but theyre gonna go out swinging I like some dead spin and some barstool and some ringer. Its like Neapolitan ice cream Seems a bit petulant Lol didnt you just say you didnt realize the site still existed? yeah Whats your point ive been following your conversation and I just went to the site. Seems like theyre just shitting on their desks on their last day. You cant have an informed point about something you dont follow at all? My bad dude I guess Ill stick to sports They got a mandate from higher ups that they were forbidden from posting anything non-sports related Which is bullshit So they stood up for themselves Would it have been better if they just said ok sure boss, whatever you say!? Dunno what I was thinking having an opinion about how some dudes were behaving pretty stupid of me Stick to gaslighting Ian Kinda the mo of the site Im just a dumb dumb that puts pictures on the internet ??????? So fits their culture. Wouldnt expect anything different Office politics arent something I would understand Lol elaborate then I think its childish lol In what way are they behaving? Are you against workers strikes in general or just this circumstance? this circumstance ? I dont care if workers strike, especially if theyre being mistreated, underpaid, abused, etc. But if you dont like the direction of the company maybe go work somewhere else? Idk Thats kinda weak I guess this is just me, but if I was going to get fired or quit or leave the company I probably wouldnt do it in such a way that might make it hard for me to get a job at the next place Basically Like if I was gonna leave nike, I probably wouldnt tweet out Mark Parker is a pussy ass bitch from @nike on my way out Yah but thats your choice personally. Doesnt mean taking a stand isnt admirable Yah but if someone else did it would be cool Basically, because youd eat the shit, youre mad someone else had the balls not to? https://deadspin.com/the-hateful-life-and-spiteful-death-of-the-man-who-was-1737376537 Come on this is great Also nike is not a news outlet and workers strike all the time Man you guys are super sensitive today Do you throw a temper tantrum every time your boss tells you to do something you dont want to do Kinda It thats cuz no one can tell me what to do Youre sensitive! Spicy liga is my favorite liga Dubov, did you just call someone fucking sensitive????? Absolutely Lmaooooo You dont think I, as a sensitive person, can identify somebody being sensitive? Like a dog doesnt recognize another dog when it sees one? If it were like, my ad agency, and Id led it for over a decade ad some jackass ownership came in and demanded that we quit doing everything that made it good I actually appreciate this take Yeah Id prob stick up for myself and get fired This is a classic succession move ok but you dont think there is another way to stick up for yourself and your work that might make it easier for you to get another job? Help me out with a detail I dont fully understand. Why did they sell to these jackass owners? If they didnt like the direction they were going Whats them getting another job matter to you It doesnt, all I said was that their behavior seems petulant And that set you guys off lol They got aired by Peter theil and their original wiener went bankrupt I mean, Deadspin hasnt been owned by deadspin for a long time. Univision owned them and sold them to whoever owns them now That suggest its immature They got picked up by Univision and then sold to a bunch of old Forbes dudes Right, its childish and bad tempered Are you anti independent media? Anti worker? I dont get it lol Why this hill? lol dont think this is a hill? Its not immature Its standing up for something Lol this isnt like a regular office job, journalists cant just change their voice/worldview Its not like theyre posting pictures of animal penises By posting Woman furiously shits on floor of Tim Hortons, throws it at employees? What if their boss asks them to write about how great trump is? Thats a real video Sorry but editorial freedom is the only thing that keeps us informed Theyve had a million videos like that on that site And this is a snapshot of whats killing it. Your take is stupid lol. Are you like personally friends with these dudes? Like why defend their honor Dubov has ousted himself as a Joe Biden supporter with these Boomer level takes Cause I agree with standing up for yourself over corpo journalism shit down types Outed* How are they not the good guys here Fuck respect culture They have been my primary source of news for almost a decade lol, not just deadspin but all the former gawker media vertices Jezzy, splinter (RIP), etc Thats fine, Im sure they write good news articles? Kinda get the sense that they think theyre the smartest guys on the internet Dubov Im having a watch party for ufc this weekend, let me know if youre coming and Ill be sure to make Waldorf salad and jello for you Forgive me for thinking that some smart writers might be able to come up with a more mature way to handle a disagreement with management? Only way every one can find out Guess they should have sent an in house slack message Ill bring a charcuterie board ? Whats the end game? Go out on your own terms, get a new gig I dont understand what you are saying, they are basically striking. What else are they supposed to do that isnt essentially complying Quit? Theyre in a union So theyre striking by... working? Why not just stop publishing? Because they probably think they make a bigger statement by telling their bosses trying to police editorial to fuck off Correct Ok so humor me Play this scenario out Do their new bosses see the wrongs in their ways and say youre absolutely right, employees. Continue writing whatever you want. Nope def not Actually Dubov I wouldnt be surprised to see them win this one But if they just get along with that then they cease being deadspin Public pressure from their readership is the only thing thats gonna turn it around Deadspins tone is its value both as an idea and as a business They post an email for readers to complain that they received so many emails it had to be taken down Just because you wouldnt do it doesnt mean that isnt cool someone else thinks its important enough to risk personal gain for a cause What youre saying is When in doubt Grab your ankles lol Yeah I just dont even understand what your concern is when you say dont these guys wanna get jobs again? Are you actually concerned for their careers? Say what you want about deadspin, but you should see how their sister charcuterie website is protesting! www.Meatspin.com Hahhaahhaha i wouldnt say Im concerned, Im just really curious Also to be fair, Ive definitely seen gawker media act childishly in the pastI.e. the Cond Nast exec outing that got a bunch of people firedbut this aint that rn What I said is that it seems petulant. It seems. As in it gives the impression to me. Idk that that can be argued? It can certainly be argued against That something gave me that type of impression? I mean, I guess you could argue it. You could argue anything you want in this world, so Im wrong about that Yah and then everyone said this is why youre wrong. Thats an arguement Lol that is the worst cop out of all cop outs You could argue whether or not its petulant. Well thats just my opinion How so? Thats literally what I said I was giving an opinion Ok thats what were doing lol And then you told me I was dumb for having that opinion Which is fair And then we shifted to what theyre actually doing And were explaining why we dislike your opinion Yeah I still dont get it but thats fine We are not debating whether or not you have an opinion Sorry if that wasnt clear Youre super riled up about this one so its clearly something very important to you Its not that hard to get me riled up Dont worry I will feel sheepish and guilty for caring so much and using harsh words in about an hour or so ?Me during this entire argument And then rinse and repeat next time any minor controversy pops up help understand this - are they gonna get fired or nah? What were those tweets earlier about not being employed? Did I misunderstand that And if so, do you have a headshot of these writers I can use to make a Kap ad for twitter Barry Petchesky (deputy editor) and Hamilton Nolan (knows and posts nothing about sports) Got fired They are integral to the site and very beloved by their readership and colleagues alike Do they have equity? So people are super pissed Like whats the ownership structure They have a union, so sort of if its just a bunch of rich old suits owning it, I have a hard time thinking theyre gonna cave on this if it means articles written about their rich white friends But also, like, why did they but it in the first place? If not to kill it/? I think its more likely the site folds complete than it being turned into golf digest lol If thats why they bought it Which I think they may have Then protesting that is more important than ever Cause thats something happening all over now Our system is stacked against independent news If you report on powerful people you risk vindictive lawsuits The strange thing is that a relevant story that all news sources were reporting is the straw that broke the camels back And if you dont have backing you can get ripped to shreds in a heartbeat I dont even know how to fix that tbh But to Ians admission earlier The real reason theyre in this spot Is posting hulk Hogans sex tape Sooo... O ok Dubov May have some small tiny point! I shouldve asked this up front but what was the story that got them in trouble Cause to me deadspin is a site that makes snarky comments about old white nfl owners and shit like that I assumed trump being booed at World Series based on timing I actually kinda side with them on the hogan tape but the real gross one was when they reported on a Cond Nast exec for having an affair with a mail escort and then paid the male escort to effectively allow him to blackmail It was the Vigo Carpathian one The guy wasnt out publicly And not really a public figure at all And then they were so indignant that anybody had a problem with that And threw a tantrum and crags the editor stepped down I still think Jordan Sargent needs to answer for that shit They also tried to frame it like it was everybody else who was being homophobic and they were just reporting like they would anybody else Which was clearly bullsbit bc like, how did they know what arrangement this guy had with his wife So yeah, they have definitely fucked up in the past, Ill concede their But that was gawker and not really relevant to this situation I mean Im looking at this in a vacuum I mean that was a while ago and again, not deadspin Were not really talking about whether or not gawker has ever published a questionable price of content Can all the dudes at dead spin just leave and make their own new site? Holy shit that meat spin site is ?????? They clearly have loyal followers https://twitter.com/nbcsports/status/1129791776720596992?s=12 Oh oh lets take sides on this one and argue Ha good one less dirtbag Thats mine howd I do You know, Brock, I think Im on managements side here... Jefferson Davis had a similar take lol Im kidding Dabo sucks Hes the worst Lol how can anyone argue against allowing players to profit off their own image Ive never understood that at all They think it will take the integrity away from the tradition of the game Also man, this will be good for the schools. Like they can cut a deal with the athletes on jersey sales People will buy infinitely more jerseys if there are names on them Like thats always been the the thing with college jerseys You buy one and youre set for life Thats why I only support schools that dont have names on the pack of their jerseys I cant wait for all the people saying they wont watch anymore if players get paid Go Penn State! Talk about a program that does it the right way. Like why would you ever care ?Racist old white men will argue against it space Paying players in scholarships is like paying them in company store credit Lol.... and the schools will pay those taxes. Are we also going to tax non-athlete students who get scholarships? They can profit of their likeness. Right Hot take a HBCU will win the ncaa tournament in 10 years https://twitter.com/sethpartnow/status/1189204179119673344?s=21 This is a 3-point chart.

Still rocking the neo geo I see! ?Jeep Grand Cherokee Oh my fuckin guy what a whip Yeah I fuckin love it Renting one in Banf in December and I fully anticipate wanting one after Dude you'll be hooked. They drive so smooth. I was deciding between that and a 4Runner and I liked the Jeep way better Oh dammit dont tell me that Supposedly they're gonna finally refresh the 4Runner in 2021 so I'm excited to see what they do But I'm a big Jeep fan now The interiors of 4runners are from 98 Even the TRDs? And the windows roll down in the back For all the dogs im gonna own Oh thats sexy Yeah mark exactly haha. But apparently they're doing a full refresh on the tech specs and supposed to make it drive smoother. But 4Runner fans are such purists Thats smaller than the 4Runner right? They're about the same length but I think the Jeep is a bit more compact overall yeah My neighbor has an SRT it's so dope I used to hate my dads grand Cherokee but it was that early 2000s model that was just notoriously awful You guys know what time it is? Jimmy time? Its jimmy butler debut time bitches Correct! Congrats chad Youve been rewarded Keyword guys I love how Dallas denver is the best game by a country mile but its the one thats not nationally televised Instead we get ATL MIA and LAL MEM Smh Hey Gundy do you get nba tv with league pass or did they finally kick me off your login?

Couple hounds A scent hound And a sight hound What if someone hung dong behind home plate It would be revolutionary Matt What are you waiting for? Lol the hawks have fouled herro shooting the 3 three times Miami Heat the 3 seed I mean I dunno why not!? https://twitter.com/k_hua/status/1189260639933476864?s=21 cant wait to experience this first hand on Thursday night Pro tip take the free shuttle at arrivals level to cellphone waiting lot C and call from there But they put in food trucks! Also that! As someone thats both operated an Uber at lax and been picked up by one I feel qualified to pass down sage knowledge in this instance. Damn matty ice with the life hacks Sage knowledge sounds so much cooler than life hack imo Sage is just a dope word / name in general imo You really emphasized your point with the period at the end too. I knew you were finished. Great delivery Lot C is my hell. But I will trust you. I just flipped it back to the Heat game and Nunn immediately hits a 3 Lot C in LA ? Maybe its gotten worse since I used to do it regularly but I never had an issue and its outside the general ring of bad airport entry traffic He's kinda nice space Nunn also might get cancelled soon lol I had no idea about this but he had some pretty messed up reasons for getting kicked out of Illinois Heat twitter made it a story today ? Didn't he strangle his gf or something? Or am I making that up No thats in the ballpark I think I dont remember exactly Sounded like he water boarded his girlfriend tbh Water was some how involved Holy fuck What the hell riles Oh I meant for parking, Matt. Never could find a spot there. Ahhhhh Gotcha https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1189345093754458112?s=21 Good news We cashed in Heat -9.5 live tho Thats fantastic news Wait I dunno if he waterboarded her but yeah its not good Idk if it was water boarding but he like poured water on her or something He at the very least pushed her on the floor and dumped a glass of water on her Maybe she shoulda just shut her mouth like Dave chapelle said Well look Im not excusing this but theres a big difference between poured water on and waterboarded lol Stay woke Nunn, 22, was accused in March 2016 of putting his hands around the neck of a woman he had been casually dating, a choking accusation he firmly denies. He said he never hit the woman, but did plead guilty to one misdemeanor battery charge after being accused of pushing her down and pouring water on her. Two other battery charges were dropped Yeah I pointed this out last week! Sorry Our bad! Yeah I mean its icky rooting for him. His did get kicked out of school point blank, did 18 months of probabtion which the victim agreed to and sat out a year. 

I understand if you believe that this should be automatic disqualification. But this was at least addressed. I dont remember and he was vetted by multiple teams. The warriors had him in camp Yeah for two years Oh wow I thought he was just a camp guy No he was ?Geeze horrible headline on this article. Do you think she feels the impact as well? Ya know the one that got abused Yeah lol But yeah the dude is a hooper. He won 4 state titles at Simeon in Chicago That reminds me of an onion article Same Hs as drose and Jabari Parker Yeah And Zach Norvell and Talen Horton-Tucker Its southwest Chicago Lol Pretty gnarly! And the legend Benji Wilson The Mavs are in great position for the ML upset Is that where G-Baby wouldve gone? https://twitter.com/paugasol/status/1189269694181715970?s=21 Did we sign Pau gasol or magic johnson Lol Wow Matty I never saw that Pau and Magic had the same energy until now Impact Great word choice! God Comcast fucking sucks. There's big time drama in Denver right now. Altitude which is the station that airs nuggets avs and broncos couldn't come to terms with Comcast, so it's just not carried anymore. But League Pass still blacks out the game locally So nobody can watch sports in Denver So wack Local sports bars got cease and desist letters from the NBA and NHL because they were showing pirated streams haha Chad I meant to ask you about that. There was a WSJ article about it but ironically I couldnt read it. Wow that sucks Hey my dad works for Comcast zoning and contracts! Ill give you his email Makes me thankful for what we have here Also Maxi Kleber is just Meyers Leonard with an accent https://twitter.com/dpostsports/status/1187909112081895424?s=21 Lol I just add my dad to the Superliga What's worse is Comcast is still charging the $8/mo "regional sports fee", yet they aren't carrying the channel lol Please forward all of this to your dad Ian Dad you motherfucker! I'm outraged! Does YTTV carry Altitude? Just checked Dubov, doesn't look like it I don't understand what they're haggling over. Dish and Direct tv are at an impasse with Altitude too interesting. If Comcast is charging a regional sports fee theyre just passing along the subscription fee to the consumer so not sure what altitude would be fighting for Dave Martinez about to get tossed from this game Terrible call blue That was so bad He literally ran over the bag Where else is he supposed to run Right. He was right in the middle of the bag If his foot hit the inside corner maybe you have an argument Right I tweeted my Meyers-Maxi Kleber take and draft Twitter is up in arms Im delighted Draft twitter being mad is a joy Terry Stotts would get this challenge right. Lmaooooo Trea Turner is fucking going in on Joe Torre That makes me so happy All that to still get the call wrong If the Nats lose this game -- well, actually, nobody will care. Except Mike Wilson and Uncle Tony *Wilbon Omg Lets goo Fuck you to the crew Rendon is a savage Hell yeah Ok no more runs Bryce Harper punching the air rn So bad ass how the Nats only win road games Lol Theyre only comfortable in a one game wild card scenario at all times I couldnt handle being a Nats fan If they win it all that must be the only time the road team won every game in World Series My boss is from DC. Every morning she looks like she went on a week long bender. PFT has been trying to jinx the shit out of them lol These teams are gonna combine for like 8 more runs tonight Scherzer gonna come on in relief and have a back spasm mid pitch Throw a softball up to altuve How did it take MLB this many years to schedule a game in a corn field in Iowa? Oh shit Dave Martinez got tossed Wait, that play wasnt even reviewable?! Wow that was the lamest explanation of all time. The umpires put on the headsets to tell NY that the Nats wanted to protest the game and the replay official read the rule back to the umps over the headset. Why did that take 5 minutes? Lmao Its not gunna happen but LOL Larry if the lakers lose to the grizz https://twitter.com/mdotbrown/status/1189377724277592064?s=21 Jfc Myles sucks Thats vintage MdotBrown lmao Hes very old and bitter Hes funny at times but mostly the latter I balled with him at Wieden once When he worked at TE he would come to the Portland office and just stand outside chain-smoking cigs all day He really thinks hes Kevin Garnett on the court even tho he smells like a pack of marb reds Firing off tweets His habits were a TE legend https://twitter.com/windhorstespn/status/1189379816069484544?s=21 Preach Windy! Im surprised they dont have some sort of all-access high level league pass for media Bunch of people are replying saying to buy international league pass and use a vpn?

I love when the World Series delivers for like the 1 week a year I watch baseball Meyers Kleber pouring it in Lol By the way Meyers Leonard still trash Say it aint so !

He had a trans sister who killed herself Yeah hes from a very poor part of rural North Carolina that some how produces nba player Brandon Ingram is from the same place ESPN did a story on the town hold up http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/22467698/how-kinston-north-carolina-became-greatest-producer-nba-talent-america The second bomb's parachute, however, had failed, and that one had free-fallen for nearly 2 miles, reaching the speed of sound before plunging headlong into a plowed tobacco field. After four days of painstaking excavation, that bomb's vital arm/safe switch is also found -- set to arm. Carefully, ReVelle recovers the volleyball-sized pit of plutonium and uranium, known as the Demon Core. By the eighth day, the Air Force declares that the "principal hazards" are under control.

Eventually the massive hole, about 93,000 cubic yards of earth, is filled in with soil. "By the slightest margin of chance, literally the failure of two wires to cross, a nuclear explosion was averted," U.S. Defense Secretary Robert McNamara would later write in a memo. Damn can you imagine if we had accidentally nuked ourselves holy shit Jesus Very good read so far Yeah its honestly my favorite Baxter story Lol yeah gundy that Murray take was so bad. One of the most exclusive shooting milestones in the game and he's never even came close to two of those averages in one season Makes me feel good that every team has ridiculous homers tho lol I like to think I'm not that bad tho Except when I try trading Little for Blake Windy wrote about us trading for a forward today Link me! Also just gonna say that its probably not good news we dont have a Zach update yet https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/27926833/early-some-teams-already-looking-fix-holes-their-rosters?platform=amp#click=https://t.co/q47jJfbMTr Holdahl said they're not giving an update til we return to Portland So I'm not worried YET I mean, they already had the MRI Im gonna worry lol I hope Im wrong Lol true. With our history might as well expect the worse Just gotta hope its not a torn labrum or something cause hes young enough where hes gonna get that fixed immediately If he gets surgery thats 6 months easy Maybe more God don't say that. You're scaring me We just dont want surgery If he can rehab for a few weeks and strengthen the muscles around then we should be ok Also that article lists Denver needing a 3 lol. They have Barton, Craig, Grant and Porter What more do they need Unless windy considers porter and Grant 4's Yeah and they cant write Bradley Beal anymore cause hes untradable for 6 months I'm still so pissed Denver got Grant. He's underrated af. Will probably start for Milsap at the 4 in a lot of games And how did they get him again? Oh yeah a team over the cap with no space but they absorbed him into the TPE created by trading Wilson Chandler You know who doesn't use their TPE's? Olshey Aha!

Saw on ESPN this morning that the Nets are currently concerned with Kyries mood swings Lol yeah Its almost like they havent watched Kyries career at all Let me tell you, kyrie is just a sensitive dude. God that story was such trash. 3 games in and theyre already snitching on Kyrie lol Jackie Mac hit piece on the former Celtic He is just less of an outward bitch as Durant Removed an exclamation from Jackie Mac hit piece on the former Celtic A tradition unlike any other DUBOV Hell hath no fury like a Jackie Mac scorned Jackie mac the ?? Kyrie is insufferable Fuck him and KD You think the browns season is unsalvagable at this point ? I love how this group chat always immediately steers the rudder back to NBA lmao ?? It's shocking that those two sensitive ass dudes and Deandre Jordan who couldn't make up his mind in free agency and succumbed to peer pressure in one of the biggest moments of his life are all friends Don't forget our origins Matt!!! I did laugh when KD said Kyrie is an artist cause then I thought of Dame who actually is an artist but isnt as difficult to deal with lol He becomes uncle drew and pulls a Jared Leto and cant shake the act and has become as onery as a Boomer. What are the browns Matty? 3-5? Baker? Speaking of Baker, did you see Ron Baker has been tearing it up for CSKA Moscow?? The AFC sucks so I think its not crazy FUCK CSKA! No way the browns make the playoffs Browns are 2-5 I got Bills and Colts in before them I mean the Colts started 1-5 last year Its just gonna take a lot of things to go right They do still get the bengals twice, the broncos, and the cards The AFC is very bad Ravens and bills are losses tho That's 7 losses They gonna win out the rest? Prob not Kitchens sucks Random side note how did none of us get on Sounders +625 yesterday chad I was looking for a line on both teams getting 11 red cards and subsequently drowning in the Pacific Ocean but I couldnt find it I hope whoever wins tonights east game kicks the ever-loving shit out of Seattle God the warriors are such trash.

Wow that is gold Dude go watch the entire presser. Its fucking wild. He spoke for 48 minutes! Yeah hes nuts He just rambles They need one of those old timey hooks for him where somebody offstage can just pull him back Yeah it should be in the constitution that he has to use a teleprompter. Its the only way he slightly stays on track "They did a lot of shooting. And they did a lot of blasting" lmao My favorite was and the canine - they call it it a canine. I call it a dog. Its a dog to me. Channing Frye is Portlands newest talking head lol Twitter Jack did a good thing! No political ads on Twitter Take that fuckerberg! Booo Give me interference from foreign entities Cant wait for boomer dubovs take Man that rules. Its sick thats a not subtle shot at Zuck We going blazers over thunder? This is a revenge situation, they dont like each other!!! Blazers -1.5 Roberson is out and Adams is questionable with a bruised knee Shai and CP are great tho Not having Zach sucks I think the blazers will every game so in my unbiased opinion, lock of the night! Oh baby! Tolliver breakout game 5-8 from three book it Did we get an update on ZC? He ded. Darn No update until they get back to PDX But hes out at least a couple weeks imo https://www.instagram.com/p/B4QV4b9lqsv/?igshid=12txud2vw3ccq In today's episode of irrational confidence Yah what a ding dong The one thing I will say about Jacks statement is that he lives in this delusional world where his platforms algorithm is pure only only bubbles the content that people truly care about and engage with. Thats so far from reality. Yes, candidates and PACs will no longer be able to pay to place their bullshit directly in your path. But they can release a ton of bulls into the field and if you wander around long enough youre gonna step in a bunch of bullshit. I applaud him for making the right decision but lets not pretend like this solves the problem on twitter. It barely addresses it. Yeah but if they get caught doing the latter its a crime Didnt seem to matter for trump We play by a different set of rules now https://t.co/PyPgkBYgdV?amp=1 https://twitter.com/claytravis/status/1189508753361702913?s=12 Collangelo 2.0 amazing Status of how Cleveland now sees Baker: theyre inviting Ryan Leaf on local radio to give baker advice https://twitter.com/923thefan/status/1189650681151537152?s=21 Lol I saw twitter was calling him "Ryan leaf with swag" Finally a dope prime time game, pats v ravens this Sunday Is somebody out tonight for the Clips? kawai Ah gotcha Going to the nets game tonight Anyone want the pacers?

Jesus I just jumped on the bucks Nightmare fuel Hahahaha I love it Just bet on Dame over 26.5 points and Hassan over 12.5 rebounds No Adams they are going to eat 26.5 seems low af.

Blazers cover! Lol rockets This might go to OT Lmao Im not watching Im watching the baseball Whats baseball? Maybe you know it by the way your Latin employees call

I picked a great week to go against Harden and Booker ?? Suns +5/Moneyline was the lock of the night Both of my locks of the night lost so what the fuck do I know The suns are helping me recover my bucks losses Flagellation Crack open a nice cool Michelob Ultra Damn this baseball announcer trying to jinx the shit out of the nats Robert Sarver probably jerking off to the scoreboard right now Take that Enron https://www.instagram.com/p/B4RFiysl3bX/?igshid=1vlolpkzncakb Bryce Harper gotta be so pissed right now Lol Did Embiid even win the fight lol?

Deadspin writers quit en masse in protest of 'stick to sports' mandates from ownership https://twitter.com/i/events/1189673492737753088 https://twitter.com/JoelEmbiid/status/1189787845701058560 I vote that any suspensions from this count as a game played for Chad I agree mark Dubov you ain't winning that easy Oooo controversy! Wait what? What did I do? Joel Embiid about to get a fat suspension. We didn't stipulate how being eligible would affect our games played bet By the short clip i saw ,I feel he only deserves a game or 2 - kar should get at least 4 Kat* I feel like Kiki is gonna bring the hammer down For all the off court stuff too. Nba is soft They say Simmons might get some for choking kat while holding him back The twitter beef is what will push them over NBA IS FOR THE KIDS Wow 2 Democrats voted with the GOP today. Pussies Games played are games played! What would Vegas say Theres a reason Vegas doesnt offer political lines, only off shore books do I think it nullifies the bet. Action required Lmao dubov is 100% correct He's not gonna be eligible to play! Wait the bet is how many games will Embiid play? And youre saying suspension games dont count? yeah thats his fault Yeah lol fuck off It wasnt how many games will Embiid miss due to injury Mental Injuries! Seriously, Embiid just misses a lot of games lol Finds new and unique ways to do it! Lol injury and suspension are different But fine you'll get your money in May dubov I love futures ?One of you gif pros replace turtles with futures Heat -7 at Hawks without Trae is a super duper lock I no longer believe in locks after last nights bucks debacle Dude The Suns saved my ass last night Thank god that was my biggest bet lol The Bucks really boned us I put 50 on bucks ML. Now I can't go out to lunch today I'm punishing myself Honor The rockets have won 3 games by a total of 8 points lol I went on a roller coaster ride across the NBA, MLB, and NHL last night Those lucky fuckers Shoutout to the Nats for hitting that over and saving me And the Warriors for BARELY squeaking out the over even though they were down and out Cardinals +10.5 God that is way too much Who wants to take my money on Halloween Wait I like money Thats what I thought against the saints and they burned me lol Yah I think Im laying the points in this one This will be a serious hangover game after putting up 51 on Sunday That said Im all over Niners -10.5 Oh man you see KD throwing draymond under the bus saying their altercation factored in to his decision to leave God I love it! Please turn the entire Bay Area against draymond as the warriors go 10-72 I love it too space. Bout time they got a dose of reality ?Draymond rn They had the most fortunate run in nba history in terms of health and now they finally get to see what real teams feel like Lol I mean the warriors were biological waste for like 50 years Hey they had that one good year that one time! Draymons back about to get real sore I know and then their opponents got key injuries during every run to the finals lol While they didn't have any And then hes gonna demand a trade Brock That never happens So now they can't use the excuse that they have guys injured. Sucks to suck 2015: love and Kyrie out
2016: everyone healthy and they lose
2017: Zaza injures Kawhi 
2018: CP3 gets injured game 6 WCF ok but also They were one of the most talented teams in the history of the league for a sustained period They would get everybodys best shot 82 nights a year and still would rack up wins I mean I hate them because theyre whiny bitches but credit where credit is due Pure luck Dubov! I dont think any team wins a championship without at least some luck Oh I agree But warriors Twitter was just funny cuz they would complain if they had a guy out injured Like other teams didn't have injuries Warriors twitter suuuuuuucks Not saying they weren't a good team by any means Lol ok thats rich coming from the if only we had nurkic healthy Superliga lol Lol yeah if we had Nurkic healthy that would be awesome I hated the way they used Stephs injury in 2016 He was playing He said he was back What's wrong with wanting teams to be full strength They lost Own it You guys are missing the point here I mean that every team in the playoffs has at least one significant injury and nurkic is prob on the lower end of the scale If the blazers had a healthy Greg Oden, Brandon Roy, and LaMarcus Aldridge for more than 82 total games we wouldve been an all-time dynasty Yeah and the warriors had none. That was really lucky lol Probably wouldve competed with Bill Russell & Red Auerbach for greatest run https://twitter.com/highkin/status/1189928444798230528?s=21 50/40/90 gundy? Lol Hahaha no Highkin > malika's sister He told me about it last night he avoided that lol https://twitter.com/shaepeppler/status/1189967350491205633 Ah the tried and true pump up PowerPoint. Ready to run thru a brick wall coach! PowerPoint is inferior to Keynote Wow hot take. Never used keynote Really? Its all keynote everywhere Ive ever been Keynote is infinitely better outside of not being able to put it into google slides For real? Must be a creative thing. I've never used it my life Just PowerPoint or google slides Yah I think thats correct Yeah I would agree with that Creative world you can just assume everyone has a Mac In business ppt or die But not to worry! Box allows users to choose their productivity tool of choice. Open a PowerPoint in keynote, or google slides in PowerPoint, it's all accessible in Box. Call me today for a free trial God dammit youre good Chad What's funny is we all use Macs. We delete keynote and everything. Company buys us a subscription for Office 365 to use PowerPoint etc. Yet Microsoft is our biggest competitor when it comes to OneDrive vs. Box. Maybe we shouldn't put money in our competitors pocket lol Wow yeah that sounds pretty dumb I still use word and Im sure anyone working with the budgets still uses excel Yeah but I think we finally realized Microsoft has been bending us over. And Google hates them. So I think we're gonna start partnering with google more closely Its just PowerPoint thats gone out of style Yeah linked excel files are the life blood of finance teams Do you guys all use Gmail corporately? Or outlook? Outlook Gmail Mixed feelings about it Outlook has dark mode, my gmail still doesnt Bahaha You can update your gmail background to be images though. Mine is currently Tokyo Yahon Phoenix im still stuck tho Phone I feel like that's a generational/industry thing. Old school companies love outlook Ive only ever used outlook for work Yah but it also just flows into all the stuff you dont think about Interesting. I'd think creative firms would be all about Gmail Microsoft is loved by system admins To manage your corporate account Very true Brock Which then means you can put all the conference rooms in etc etc calendars and boom now everything is outlook for meetings and such Most ad agencies are owned by big holding companies with all sorts of different media arms now, so its def the universal shit mostly And when I try bringing Box in to replace anything Microsoft, I'm often killing jobs. Sys admins and Sharepoint developers have staked their careers in knowledge of the Microsoft stack No one wants the cardinals!!! I love outlook But one of my co-workers uses outlook on her web browser and it freaks me out Thats some serial killer shit Yup Mark whats the line I mean youve got niners no matter what 10.5 Alrighty ?I talk about you guys every day dubov. Please don't tell me any of this is inaccurate lol I dont know nothin about no finance, but the rest is all true. I work in marketing so we have an unlimited budget A salespersons two favorite words Wait so you do access outlook from your desktop? Yessir Well, truth be told mostly from my phone since Im not always at my desk But when Im on my laptop, its through the desktop app Gotcha gotcha https://twitter.com/shamscharania/status/1190026784382828544?s=21 Beat me too it Hell yeah.

This game has been dope Wow I was like wtf is bron doing driving it Dude chad I almost screamed at my phone when he drove I was so lost Mavs should have fouled him What a play by Jason Kidd (This is my narrative to create division within the Lakers) I support that How has no one on the Mavericks fought someone in Lukas defense Nba concussion protocol getting exposed Cuban drafting his tweet about the refs as we speak Does a protocol exist They talk about one lol Dwight with the bloomin onion hair Mavs the NBA version of the saint s Not getting calls How was Luka not the #1 pick lol The sad thing is, the nfl has the best concussion protocol of all the leagues. And I use the term best very loosely Xenophobia Imagine Luka and Booker Lebron playing like he's 25 Ive said it all year Lebron is going to lead the nba in assists Hahaha ? Gundy said that! Big fan of grey beard bron Can't wait til he's 40 and throwing oops to bronny Bron is special man And so is Luka Porzingis showed hes not that special to me tho Dwight was the 4th best player on the court LeBron-AD-Luka-Dwight JaVale is the vanity starter and Dwight plays more minutes lol Gundy how you gonna drag the guy who is currently beating you? Zingis also cant post up against smaller guys which is concerning Losses from Houston and Utah tonight. Gotta love that Hes not a young Kevin McHale in that regard IMO He just started balling again Also dubov Im pretending until I wake up tomorrow back in reality ?Wow that's a hell of graphic! Mighty Mouse woke up this morning with no idea SVP was gonna drag him on national tv But really hes not good at posting up smaller guys hes still good Just think going small would be more effective against him than Dallas wants it to be https://www.instagram.com/p/B4WXYjpgSsr/?igshid=1lpjeez9f9gmk I totally missed the the hold by Dwight on Curry to free up the shot lol https://twitter.com/mcuban/status/1190489555343945728?s=21 Here we go! Angry cubes Do you guys hear that? Thats the sound of Oregon running up the score on USC. LFG DUCKS. ?? ?? ?? No Collins tonight. I'm starting to think Gundy was right Im just hoping that they are trying to rehab whatever is going on without putting him under the knife But shoulders really are never the same no matter what you do So its basically up to him if he wants to play through it and wait until summer I'm sure that's what the dilemma is And whiteside is questionable Tolliver/Skal frontcourt baby! We might need Rengel off the bench Bunky is the Horford stopper This turner shultz Conor Barcelona trip is making for some great instagram content Embiid is gunna shit down our throats ! Thank the fucking lord hes suspended Oh thank god ?Nobody believes!! SCOO It says it right there SCOOSC JERRY THE KING LAWLER LOVES THE DUCKS Its best they didnt all didnt pick us.

Fuckin snake ?????? We leveled up with Cristobal! Sucks 2 suck willie Last power5 job hell ever have It's almost like the guy with a career losing record wasn't cut out for a top 25 program. Who would've thought ? What is his buyout Like 20 mil I think $17 million His agent dont care tho He cashed out ? Always makes me laugh how teams sign these long terms contracts with coaches. Who were they negotiating against that they had to give him 6 years? They thought the ducks... It was clear as day Willie wanted to go to FSU tho. Shoulda called his bluff Or hire someone else. It wasn't saban they were luring away Dubov your son signing with under armour? Lame. Damn Would hate to see Luka in such Swaggerless Shoes Also heads up Packers are getting half a point live He didn't wanna sign with adidas and live in dames shadow for the rest of his life Wtf are the Seahawks doing The Bucs are the biggest Jekyll and Hyde team in the league Hadnt heard that but it wouldnt surprise me. Nike keeps trying to make him the face of Adapt and I doubt he wants that. Would be a really bad move on his part, though. ?Guys is this good? Russ Christ Jameis Jesus Freudian slip! Them slippery crab butter hands Weird red zone possession Holy shit haha God Russell Wilson is sick Give him the gold jacket now Hawks gonna cover? I dont hate you for your take chad but I will NEVER forgive you for making me stick up for Colin fucking Cowherd. Hahaha recall my take was not that he won't be a HOFer. It's that he's not a HOFer if his career ended today Just wanna qualify that Also Ian I'm very happy for the success of the Heat right now. I'm gonna live vicariously thru you this year. The blazers injury situation is already depressing me Also are the rockets gonna have the worst defense in the league this year? They already gave up 158 in regulation and the Heat have 70+ at halftime lol What about the warriors? They'll be in a battle for the worst Feels like warriors fans are getting off too easy God Arians is such a pussy They have crossed too far into theyre so bad they cant even be embarrassing if that makes sense Go for two!!! If the hawks kicker didn't doink an XP earlier we'd have a W already I agree Brock. Steph got off easy too. He was gonna have such a rough year trying to carry this squad and now he gets off without people questioning his ability to carry a team Yah exactly. Now they get a year off and a top 5 pick its bullshit Yep. Literally best case scenario for them Fucking pussies If they get LaMelo Im gonna be on suicide watch Russell!! Let's go Thats just sickening But guys don't forget, one thing in our favor is the new flattened lottery odds. Warriors could easily win 10 games and get the 6th pick Yeah we need to hope for a New Orleans scenario Or like someone like the Suns gets the top pick after barely missing the playoffs Anybody but the dubs lol Yeah I actually love the new odds Meyers: hero or goat? Here we go Is lamelo that good? ESPN is saying hes the best distributor/creator in the draft and maybe the most complete player Damn meyers cut tomorrow?

I already put them in a parlay so Im good lol Lol Meyers is killing it 21 pts on 9/11 from the field! Thats no accident Thats a 21 point salute to those who served after 9/1 *9/11 The heat look like the warriors lol Haha omg. Meyers is doing good? are we in the upside down https://twitter.com/kennyunfazed/status/1191156927071424512?s=21 lol that tweet is dumb but I respect the hell out of his twitter name Heat are kinda cute Great movie dubov Lol sorry Dylan, Heat aint into you https://twitter.com/blsdie/status/1191176124556087298?s=21 Brady definitely called Ed Reed the N word like hes done it before lmaoo What did I just watch Doncic with back to back 15 assist triple doubles ??

2. Meyers Leonard is 2nd in the league in 3pt % (61%) shooting 8-13 so far God when we can blitz guards with jimmy and Winslow is any perimeter guy gonna score a point? It is wild theyve done this without Winslow Janes Johnson played well late night Oh yeah they didnt even have him either Fuck Bovada. Ill never use them again after that Super Bowl national anthem fiasco What happened again? They said Gladys Knight went under because she sang a word twice but she clearly went voer *over Most books just nullified the bet and refunded wager amounts, but Bovada chalked it up as a loss to all over bettors. Wow That's fucked Yah they are being super annoying they keep removing futures from my open bets Make sure to write down your ref numbers And they wont settle anything unless I email them to I got a text from my buddy yesterday "dude can you spot me 900 bucks til I get paid Friday?

We need Meyers back!" Wow do the Blazers actually miss Meyers? Its time for Terry to play Nas Honestly my biggest fight to pick with terry at this point is his resistance to play young guys. He's gotta show some faith Nas was also projected to go in the lottery. This isn't some mid 2nd round guy So Collins probably out for the year? Maybe we can resign him to an extension for dirt cheap Yeah hes eligible this summer 4 years 20 million Dented can, half off.

I like to just speak the worst case scenario so I'm only slightly let down next time Thats only healthy Thank god real basketball starts tomorrow Though I must say I cant believe they have the fucking nerve to call it the champions classic when none of the four teams are defending champions. The last time they won was 2015! https://twitter.com/kyleclark/status/1191539751750447104?s=21 Let's all take a break and laugh at this nerd Hahahaha Cat people are weird Heat +5 tomorrow https://www.instagram.com/p/B4ensyMAWHM/?igshid=1537fl63d6f1w Matt you called it Ducks basketball tonight I actually liked Matts better John Collins caught juicing So at least hed be out if we drafted him too! Wow devastating news for Dylans title chances Natural Nurk is disappointed ? Damn John Collins popped for roids too John still the better Collins tho I like how they always say "unknown to me" The Barry bonds defense still lives on! when in doubt deny deny deny Guys I have an idea for our last roster spot https://twitter.com/imanshumpert/status/1191746030703927297?s=21 Teayana Taylor coming to blazers games can save the season Fuck it sign him up Him and dame can have rap battles on the plane https://twitter.com/balldontstop/status/1191480529071177728?s=21 Our shit performance broke Pau Basically he saw Grown Ups 2 in theaters and then declared modern cinema dead Re: Nurk. Big Papi basically said the same thing before he got popped. If you told me every guy in the league was on something I would believe you And I would be ok with it Who added John Witherspoon to the chat Oh yeah Dude they have to. These guys play or practice every day of their lives from the time theyre 12 years old. The body cant take that. Ask mark about lebron and Dwight Howard Eric Paschall got 34-13 last night!? Yeah I mean Lebron is the obvious anomaly everyone thinks of when it comes to PEDs lol I def think its some kind of combination between drugs and the crazy balance/core work he does And obviously diet too Theyre all on steroids THE CREAM AND THE CLEAR Bonds is still the ?? Whats that company he has? Ladder? Yes, I tried their stuff Thats all roid powder You cant convince me otherwise Either that or a placebo jeter did it clean Its basically like dehydrated greens you put in a bottle Or protein powder They give you like a combination of powders I did it for a piece I never published The greens shit is literally just drinking dirt lol God the Chargers might move to London permanently Chad are you gonna go to the game!? Just laughing at all these dudes from SEC country getting drafted and having to move to London lol Imagine being a scout for the Chargers, you probably would never even go to London It would just be impossible They would just go 8 home games and 8 away games Youre in London for 2 months and then done Theyre the perfect team for it they already play 16 away games Cant wait for the first story of Melvin Ingram or something just becoming a part of London culture, drinking tea and shit Guys kneeling to protest brexit I should be able to live in Paris AND play for the London Chargers Austin Ekeler https://www.instagram.com/p/B4fVC9QnK4W/?igshid=13w2bkgh9xylt Who wants to gamble tonight Heat nuggets Heat +5 Yeah bro Im taking the Heat The Nuggets have not been good God the worst part about the heat being good rn is the group chat being so nice to me, it creeps me out! Im super interested in the Lakers-Miami line That will probably be my first Heat game *fade Jimmy is really good and were deep as shit, gonna be a fun year! Im on the Heat Fuck I forgot blazers -4.5 was the final piece of my teaser last night. goddamnit. Perma-fading blazers from now on Dubov as our college sports expert do you have any recommendations for tonights double header? Kansas and Michigan State I think Michigan State is a lock for the Final Four With the spread? Whats it at? I think Duke opened as the favorite but KU is laying points now But if you can get either game within 2-3 points I would take it imo Kansas is favored by 2.5 Idk about the totals, though. Kinda hard to gauge on these season opener exhibitions Kansas -2.5
Michigan state -3 yeah I like that. Im gonna go in on that right now Im sure they are the top 4 teams but I feel they get ranked this way cuz they always tip-off the season ? Yeah Rengel I think they always get gassed up a little bit at the start of the year i think its harder with college basketball than football because the player turnover has more impact Nick Saban probably doesnt even know his players names week one and it doesnt matter Los Angeles Chargers considering a move to London, The Athletic reports https://twitter.com/i/events/1191727658226180096 John Collins is suspended for 25 games over a failed drug test https://twitter.com/i/events/1191740471892033537 Twitter trends are spicy this morning Superliga Trends Alright I talked to a guy I know with the blazers and best thing available is Rip City Row. We could get 14 tickets for $1,134 ($81 per guy). It's 200 level. Comes with $10 food voucher. And he could take us court side to watch warm ups an hour before the game if we wanted Or we could swap the warm ups idea for something else. I asked what other freebies he could hook it up with That sounds pretty sick to me That feels like a good deal Or for any Portland guys I could press him for his personal tickets to another game this year. And you throw some money toward beer for the group Will we have 14 people? As long as I can meet Meyers Leonard I'm happy How about several of you say you're Illinois alums and we get a meet up with Meyers and Nunn Yeah Illinois alums love Nunn! Nick Foles back baby! LFG Jags still have a shot at a wild card. They have the Colts twice but then a bunch of shit matchups: Titans, Chargers, Falcons and the Raiders too Im 100% in for a Rip City Row They show you on the big screen, dont they? JOEVAN CATRON SUPERLIGA We are 100% saying that is our group name Or just simply the superliga ?Mr. 50/40/90 himself! Gundy I'm gonna @ malika's sister every day with updated stats Lmaooo Im sure youll catch a quick block And perhaps the wrath of the NABJ task force, idk if you want that Haha I haven't been blocked in awhile. Could use some excitement Chads just trying to holler at her https://www.instagram.com/p/B4ft7NqBZ_1/?igshid=6iw3lh7br8r4 I'm not worried about Zach at all anymore! We just needed the hammer to speak! In for rip city row https://twitter.com/TwitterMoments/status/1191805831987240964 Celtics -6.5 vs the Cavs??? https://twitter.com/shamscharania/status/1191816387825717248?s=21 Four months is honestly encouraging I was thinking 6-8 Just say season ending and spare me the attempt for positivity lol He ain't coming back Let's just tank. Race the warriors to the bottom Is it time to call melo with our tail between our legs? Dear god no Tolliver ain't it man We need help ASAP Lol Melo aint it either Absolutely not Melo after he dissed us so many times lol Fuck that man Lol I was kidding about melo I'm trying to illustrate our dire situation But Tolliver is absolutely ass Melo is trash So is Tolliver Bazemores shooting has been disappointing At least Tolliver tries on defense Yes. We are fucked Dame set him up for so many open looks last night We need Faried At least he's an nba player Tolliver executed one of the worst close outs Ive ever witnessed in my life at the end of that Sixers game Tolliver should retire Lol the blazers are gonna go on a 7 game win streak in like March And then the conversation around here will be how many games does it take to beat the bucks in the finals Lol Ian that'll get us back to .500 We'll need a 14 game win streak to mean anything Beating the clippers on the road would be a nice start Idk how that happens But it would be nice! ? And tbh classic blazers Its the nba! Youll beat some good teams and lose to some shitty ones But yeah the depth looks to be an issue I mean they made a bet that Zach could fill in the Aminu role and the Meyers role Starting 4 and back up 5 And they are catching a brutal beat And Jody is willing to spend but wasnt willing to triple the tax bill to bring Aminu back is basically why hes not a blazer I mean I dont think Zac Collins is that good lol, but yeah maybe they can find a good vet to fill the void for a bit I mean he could if he was playing. Couldn't have predicted the injury Just shitty luck Lol he's better than Aminu space Aminu is in a great spot in Orlando as the 4th best forward on the team Yeah probably! I dont think hes trash or anything Either But I bet theres a serviceable 4 out there Prob woulda been hard for him to stay and accept a benching too I would love for them to see if anyone pops in the G League But 4 is probably the thinnest position in the league now Kelly O on the block We don't have anything to trade for anyone right now lol Yeah but the heat might just want Kelly off the books We don't even have salary to match man I think hes super useful on our team but hes overpaid 80% of the cap is tied up in whiteside dame and CJ Baze doesnt match? Bazemore is worth more to us than anyone else I'm talking a salary dump move from another team gunz Fair but it would be nice if he could hit a fucking jumper But say there's a team that has a guy like Kelly O that's serviceable but they don't want him on the books. We couldn't even take anyone like that lol You need middle ground contracts to match those scenarios That's what was nice about Harkless and Meyers deals Maybe we're like the SF giants and we just succeed every other year. We'll get swept as the 8 seed this year then go to the finals next year Why you gotta bring the giants into this Heat blazers 2021 nba finals I decided about 20 minutes ago I like Cleveland tonight They can def cover 6.5 at home Did you smoke pot 21 minutes ago? Let me get that action I already bet Lol And Here We Go Future Portland Trail Blazer Tristan Thompson is averaging 17 and 11 Tristan and K-Love for Whiteside on Dec. 15 GIVE IT TO ME (We probably cant make the money work unless we trade nurk) Throw in bazemore! I still wanna figure out a way to get LA I think if we don't find a trade for Baze and/or whiteside this year, we just bring em back at a much lower number next year. Whiteside / healthy nurk would be legit LaMarcus is gonna be 35 next year Swing the pendulum the other way. Oldest team in the league! Okay space seriously, give me a trade idea for Love Curious what you think is fair Lol wut For who? Ohhh for love Yeah Love to Portland Uhhh I mean I just dont see them wanting whiteside and bazemore Youd have to get rid of one of the young guys, Simons or Collins Fair. It's not always that black and white tho. They're also trading for salary relief Love's contract is a net negative I was thinking Whiteside, Trent and 2 firsts Yeah Id just be willing to bet someone whos contending will make a push Or swap Trent for Little Yeah The two firsts Maybe could help Fair fair The market is always fickle. Bidding wars start quick Could also be bone dry I think any team that offers two firsts has a legit shot Wow real Maroney take by me there I think Dame is getting old enough it's time to start leveraging our picks and play for the present https://twitter.com/notoriousohm/status/1191884011007668225?s=21 Sick https://twitter.com/theonion/status/1191714802873315329?s=21 One positive of daylight savings is that now even tho I'm leaving office at same normal time since it's dark my brain tricks myself that I've worked harder I was way off last night and Ive had some tequila but Lakers down 15 at bulls is a tremendous live bet oop imo Lakers are +225 Im going in lol The first time I bet against my baby bulls, they show out. This is how it works every time. And every time I do it. Lakers better come back or imma have a date with the bottom of this bottle of casa migos Save some for me chad I gotchu Chad just drink the casa migos and watch the heat Listen if tonight is what spurs the bulls to hit the over then Im okay with it ? Sorry I didn't go to the game tonight. I got tix to see the flat earther play the nuggets next Thursday tho 28 turnovers for KU. Whattya gonna do? ??????? lol when a college kid says the amount of work we put in gave them the advantage. every team has the same number of hours lol Meyers on fire lolol Cavs cover! ? Ian I just got my first taste of Eric reeds auctioneer ass voice Its finally NBA You guys need Kelly O The heat can pass the ball! Even bam! https://twitter.com/WorldWideWob/status/1191907624838668289 Lamarcus No!!!! I hate the hornets so much Even if the Lakers lose this i have a fire tweet drafted for blazers twitter so its truly a win win God fucking Luke Korver Kornet* Who the fuck even is that guy Knicks cast off who I only know because of his presence in a major media market Kornet is legit not owned by a single human on Yahoo Fantasy Time for Dwight, the NBAs plus-minus leaded, to bring us home *leader Is Dwight a top 5 center again?? Hes easily the best backup I wouldnt say top 5 But maybe top 10 I love overreacting on small samples It's literally my fav thing But he looks great No homo You only get November once (Gotta say that cuz Dwight) Wow how are the mighty Miami heat losing to the puny Denver Nuggets The nba is crazy! We want the herro, Nunn, Butler lineup! New death lineup The baby bulls blew it again but its the Spurs that actually fucked me this time! Am I living in crash world!? Krzyzewski. Self. Izzo. Calipari. Champions Classic? They should call it the Scumbag Shootout. Lol well you might as well include the entire ncaa sans the players ?Not drowning in tequila after all ???? Can I have it then? Lake show!!! Lakers ML saving my bovada balance Ian whats the feel on the Heat Live bet? Lol no we cant hit a shot Jokic is infuriating Derrick Jones jr is insane lol Hes progressively getting in worse shape but is somehow still good Hes the Jared Lorenzen of nba players Like him getting cooked by Luis Scola wasnt a fluke and yet it doesnt matter?!? Hoping they can rally to cover 5.5 You know what I dont need? Dickie Vs take on NCAA allowing players to profit off their likeness. Yah the one asshole whos used the ncaa to profit of his likeness the most I also dont like how bilas plays both sides of the argument Dont need any diaper dandies sneaking bills outta Dickie Vs wallet! Its 11:15 in New York and theyre starting the second half. Idk how yall do it. Im about to go to bed. Im getting murdered tonight could go 0-6 I also will he going to bed Same, Mark. Actually Im gonna get a win. Shoutout to Buzzcut Brad and the Wisconsin Badgers. God the heat were fucking atrocious One of us! This might not be a fun week Whatever the spread is against the Lakers Im taking the Lakers lol Guessing 6.5 Lebron will choke when he sees his old friend Kendrick Nunn and Chris Silva This is my daily rant against people who get to the front of the coffee line and dont know what they want Just bought tix to see Sturgill Simpson in Nashville Wow mark thats dope Im guessing youre going to be there already? Well, now I am Its Memorial Day weekend so Im gonna go see Jake and go to the concert Dope Wow that rules. I had to pass on Sturgill tickets at the gorge. I think Coachella, stagecoach, Sturgill three weekends in a row might actually kill me. I am going in PDX I really hate that the Portland show is at VMC Yeah it was worse at the Schnitz That is a terrible concert venue The sound is awful in there Ive enjoyed every show Ive been to at the Schnitz Sturgill was playing heavy guitar riffs and super loud, you could barely hear him sing in there i could see why somebody like Sturgill wouldnt sound good in there. Ive mostly seen acts like Kacey there VMC is a concrete box surrounded by a glass box. It is the worst sounding venue Ive ever been in. Not to mention its also tough because Sturg doesnt play songs like they are on the album so some are tough to even know which song it is. Made for a so so show at the Schnitz Kacey was great apparently from what my wife said Definitely makes sense Id like to hear him outside but I also know he doesnt love playing outdoor venues Oh I didnt know that Mark where is it playing in Nashville He said it on Rogan Bridgestone The hockey arena on broadway What are we betting on tonight boys Syr/UVA under Cant trust the Bucks on the road to cover Orlando +7.5 at Dallas tho I like very much Gundy I'm on the same wavelength I think Orlando could even pull off a win today. +7.5 points is even safer I put 25 on the spread and 10 on the ML +265 is too tasty to pass up Bovada has the MIL game up for like an hour after kawhi was announced out at -110. I Should've hammered that one Clippers are still good even without kawhi They could win tbh True Bev and trez don't give af about no load management Wow I love Philly getting points at Utah with Embiid back LOVE Also off their first loss Philly is gonna win that yuge game for my under overs Ill trail the magic and the 76ers My confidence is shot after yesterday #notMyBigDog https://apple.news/A0HPYD9lRQHOwJd9Ypm2f9w Fun fact: the MET police of London use Box for all their CCTV footage. Good thing we didn't have an outage then so they could catch the guys What a mad lad Sead is Didn't even react Lol yeah he was like what are you clowns doing ?

Dawg you wrecked a motorcycle you didn't have a tragic ACL tear Ok mark we on I mean that injury wrecked his career No shit but it's his own fault. He's talking about load management and players putting it all on the line for teams that can move on at any moment Terrible example.

But step brothers is just so fucking quotable ? Elf is so impressive because there arent really that many good original Christmas movies in the 2000s Kicking and screaming very very underrated When they make the mega person can I get half of the caffeinated version and half of the uncaffeinated version? One half calf ! Why isnt Semi pro on the list Valid Bill Simmons probably banned it because there's an anti Boston joke or something Baze Pull up 3! He lives! James Johnson looks like he went to prison to get his braids tightened and lose 15 pounds cause pat riley told him to Surprised bill doesnt have some weird take like night at the Roxbury is wills best movie Damn someone pointed out on Twitter that all those will ferrell movies came out in only a 7 year stretch Dynasty Hezonja! stoning Kawhi on back to back possessions?!?

Dude kicking and screaming was pretty funny lol I love Mark wahlberg and the other guys was still so so for me. The tuna scene was hysterical everything else was eh Gators bitches always wear jimmy's is pretty damn good tho. Still use that one Old school hits different because its the only R rated movie on that list too https://www.instagram.com/p/B4l1Z9iAurg/?igshid=qhyuqgsyfaxh Meyers get the fuck out of here honkey! Step bros. Easy I have to say guys I think dame is getting fed up with Whiteside Ive never seen him look at a dude then look away to another guy multiple times like he has with Hassan Yup God what a dominant performance after a quick tune up game Do we need to trade whiteside already Protect dame at all costs It is DIRE We got shootahs!!!! Remember when Chad commented on his Ig post and he responded Whiteside is so dumb Feels like that was like 2 days ago Bring back Meyers!! ? ?Baby billy !!!! Unless he gets Montrezl to eat his ass in the 2nd half Im gonna be upset lol They didnt know who baby billy was smh Im drunk as shit please text chad whoever wants Seahawks +6 no limit hes gonna track the bets for Monday Ill respond at a reasonable hour in Tokyo Degenerate optimism: +280 Gundy I can't watch the game right now what's TNT crew saying about whiteside? Is it that bad? Did they really call him stupid? Yes and lazy They aren't wrong. But that's embarrassing Lol God damn. Things are going south fast Mark we got that game no matter what but Im down to put a little extra on it Get Whiteside out of Portland Can you delete your Ig comment plz He wont notice hes mid game Tolliver 4 point play lol Blazers basketball lmao Classic Did Hood just claw the claw ? Portland has oddly had great 1v1 defense on Kawhi ? Wait dont do it Not yet Hes playing with effort ! Gunz when they have the long cut of balmer just staring like a serial killer is that a cameraman right in front of him or something cross court ?? The Whiteside cycle is upon us Need a jekyl and Hyde poster but its white and side Tolliver = ?? Thats fucked up by Moe Conspiracy theory - terry made Whiteside watch the entire TNT halftime show Or they throw up our tweets on the projector Also possible They coulda seen everyone tweeting then found the clip And put it on his iPad I would do it for sure Ledlow ! Our girl! Hezonja is garb Simons! J.K. Simons !!!! Yes!!!! Young Simons Heat check Mari- no Bro Lol you guys get what you deserve Whiteside is averaging 14-12.5 His defense on Kawhi I dont know whats happening Was dominant in 3 games Now youre like cursing his existence Oh here comes space like the kool aid man Just bursting in to ruin our echo chamber Whiteside has 18 boards rn and youre beating the best team in basketball 45 mins ago you were calling him trash lol Hes turned the team around in the 2nd half We were complaining at halftime dude ! Worlds greatest fans! We are praising his play This is how it works! Were not good job good effort fans Lol no just around here Hezonja has turned Kawhi over 3 times And I dont think Kawhi has scored on him All time weird game The clippers guards cannot handle Ant Beverley is toast If we had Collins wed be up 15 Simons is getting me fucking amped GUARD PLAY Its the one weakness of the West elite aside from houston and Utah Continuing to give Kawhi 15 footers probably not a good idea imo Knew that was going down That was the most Lou Williams shot Fucking lou Hadnt hit a 3 and was 6-15 before that shot, vintage Lou Im pro whiteside FWIW Ian It cannot be overstated how terrible the clippers court is Its awful Whiteside showed why the trade was worth it tonight He just cant play half a game Expected but hurts nonetheless We're fucking 3-5 rn guys god dammit Are we gonna miss the playoffs Yeah, golden state and Philly were worse but tonight just drives that home Do we blow it up The Miami Heat are 7-2 Lol how would you blow it up tho? Like get rid of CJ or dame? Kawhi had 18 in the 4th That was just Kawhi shit We honestly played pretty good D Yeah lol, you guys almost beat the clippers on the road Just playing from behind killed them Simons played well I wanna start Simons lol I feel like tonight is more of a positive than anything lol Fuck it Over CJ? Over Tolliver Just go 3 guards Hmmmm Lean into the identity I dont see that working theyre all too perimeter It was a good closing look Big wings like kawhi/jimmy/fucking lebron Would just fear Feast Tho honestly it doesnt really matter who starts Houston plays Eric Gordon 37 minutes off the bench in 3 guard lineups. We could do the same But they also suck at defense lol We could kinda use Moe and Chief. Their brick 3 pointers and all Ant played 26 He plays 32 Yeah thats a nice boost Yeah but Gordon am at lease sort of body dudes And like you said, they still suck Defensively I want Little Start him over Tolliver our defensive rating was 102.8 tonight which isnt even bad We shot below 30 percent from 3 again When shooting was supposed to be the biggest upgrade Hezonja 1-9. Woof Clippers are gonna be so sick with George Shady terry lmao https://twitter.com/paolouggetti/status/1192687350570086400?s=21 Lololol Thats good However The clippers can afford to rest their best dudes and still win Most teams cant do that lol Almost faught a multiple of people and yellingly consoled in a multitude of blazer fans here.

Lost 50 bucks on the blazers fuck Hood and Skal sustained injuries as well Omg So we should tank with the warriors Report from the Locker room: dame is patient but that patience is being tested Can't blame him Whiteside was also visibly uncomfortable after the game. Whole lower body covered in ice, definitely feeling the back to back and being the only center on the team Any timetable on pau Jesus Do we want Melo at this pointe No And no Nas was dope tonight Even ate into bazemores minutes Jesus Yahoo chose to sit AD for me with an injured Myles Turner in the lineup Dope ?When ur reading blazers twitter and ur dead inside Also saw Whiteside checking his phone so he could see the Heat score He still thinks about you Ian! *wolverine looking at photo on bed meme and wolverine is Whiteside and the photo is the heat* ?

Breakfast is served FUUUUUCK Fish market? Yea near it Youre making me want to go back already $13 bucks baby Wow ?Is this the style these days? ???????

Yeah I teased it down to 210 Ahh damn Oh damn that white shooter from the LeBron heat days is a Memphis coach Mike Miller! Removed a laugh from Mike Miller! Dude if you look at Mike Miller tapes from like 2003 He had an above the rim game Love that the warriors are the only 2-9 team DETROIT BASKETBALL is in the cover zone I hit the heat ML parlayed with the blazers Thats a good parlay They will for sure win Just need Detroit to make them sweat Suns hawks ML live bet baby! Lets go! Hawks are +295 and their up 5 points Free Maction! If someone in your parlay pushes its a push even if you get the others right? Pistons just pushed at +9 I got Blazers, Hawks and Suns left Yah but teasers fail usually Dana giving Penny some pointers Come on Pheonix! Lakers Suns is a classic Lakers suns matchup like the old days Hopefully its a matchup where the suns win and I win $250 What was the live line? +250? Lol its the Aaron Haines javale McGee showdown +135 I parlayed it with the hawks at +295 No ones gonna like this but tomorrow hit the raptors Especially if the zers drive the line up tonight Oh thats smart lol Right now Toronto is getting +3 Portland off a back to back Im not betting that game because I dont ethically do that at games I cover But I recommend it for everyone lol I just wont bet against teams I like. Only for them when I think they can cover. And I wont bet on UW to cover "good jump stop on the run by Prichard" ?????? My bets tonight are Lakers -3 parlayed with jazz moneyline, blazers -2, and blazers -2 parlayed with Heat moneyline Everything still in play lol Okay I can buy the bet back at $48 I put in $25 Can the suns pulls this out should I go for the gold? Let it ride Home team As Seb Gorka, the dragon of Budapest once said, "scared money don't make money " https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/59bef6fc38d20d1f008b734a-960-720.jpg All time stuff https://www.instagram.com/p/BYQvpQ0HpOa/?igshid=1wjbs1dhdfsy5 Im literally dying right now lmaoo cup holder of the sacred tit of Attila Fuck off tolliver It's so good Good defense by Gary Trae Young is cooking Barton right now Wait did Gary Trent change numbers I think so He was 9 last year? Yeah Fuck nuggets closing the gap Not boxing out James Wiseman seems like a questionable strategy imo Is he like athletic and good at rebounding? The ducks are a wagon calm down boys Going to run the pac I thought Oregon played a poor first half but definitely picked it up in the second half I mean they just sort of handedly beat the team ranked a spot ahead of them This game didnt feel out of hand at all Thats a good sign Lets go jazz! I disagree with that but sure Great contributions from the older and younger guys, feels earlier in the year than ever before We made a ton of mistakes tonight but the effort in the second half was very strong Yeah we did and you didnt feel good most of this game? Didn't see much out of Tajaun Porter is he hurt ? Idk who most of these players are so idk what the expectations are Even with the mistakes we look like the better yesm Nah I was pretty nervous tbh Yeah I do a bit more and theyve been checking the boxes thus far I would agree were a much better team than Memphis Weve got a lot of depth and the young guys seem ready to go more than before Yeah thats all Im saying Dana teams can really take time to play well this is earlier for one of his teams I agree with that They always come on strong late Memphis is all freshman we should be handling this team easily Not just last year but in previous years its taken a while, even a quarter of the year or so but it already looks better. One of the best offenses Ive seen in a while. Honesty I think if Wiseman isnt dealing with all the off court bullshit he probably is more focused We are also young at spots, lots of freshman playing. We are going to be older a lot this year thats just college basketball. Draft Twitter is already anti wiseman We are always going to be older But they hate people with talent so thats par for the course Dana loves grad transfers Sprinkling in freshman 4 and 5 stars Yeah I never know who any of the players are until the third or fourth game Besides Pritchard Yeah my dad is crazy about recruiting so I always know early from him. Plus with basketball its only 5-6 guys MAYBE Covered. Great team. Come on lebron! Whose watching this suns game rn Gimme some of that sweet yen! Me obviously Wtf bullshit star treatment Kate brown wants to gimme $92 now Shes nervous af Fuck you kuzma! Reminder ? 415 if I go 4-4 lol God damn youre better at gambling than me What the fuck are the blazers doing Which is basically Lakers -3, jazz moneyline, Heat moneyline, blazers -2 Portland really gonna fuck me? Are we really this bad? It's bad Dubov We don't got shootahs We're dead last in the league in assists per game Dame ISO's more than harden out of necessity I swear to god guys If the blazers ruin my payday We got this ?This might be the worst bench since we were rolling out Luke Babbitt nightly Can Lillard take every shot? Guys what the hell I though being a blazers fan was fun Ian being a blazers fan is about pain Come on Thank god we have Ant Jesus Christ Gary Trent saving us Blazers just taking a break while Im on vacation Well be good next Monday dont worry Come on! Whered that rip city magic!? ? Are these the most ?? joints of all time? The blazers are in the bonus Lillard and McCollum gotta attack every single possession Hassan is doing a good job munching inside they just gotta get some stops Whiteside!!!! Do we give up the most threes in the league? Cause it feels like it. These defensive rotations are ass Wow sweet guys Could have won 400 dollars Go blazers Yeah Went from up $300 tonight to most likely down $100 We actually don't give up the most 3's. We're decent. But our defense is trash Offense ain't much better And our rebounding is atrocious compared to years past Is it time to panic yet? That was disgusting Our rebounding is disappointing We were supposed to be a power team Typically top ten on both sides on the glas Glass I dunno, its gonna take so long for the role guys to gel and even when they do theyre not that great You could compete for a playoff spot But come on lol This team is not competing with either of the LA squads Not without a trade If we could get bogi and Bjelica from the kings that would be a nice move without it costing much I dont think theres a trade you could make that would put you in contention with the clippers or the lakers Why would they give us either player lol Theyre not signing either one I agree with space. We're a far tier below anyone contending out west I dont think if you got James harden youd be better than either of them lol They already committed 180 million to Buddy and Barnes The thing is a whiteside trade falling into place, getting everyone back full strength and it's a totally different story D'antoni has shown you really only need a strong top 6 I dont say bottom of the west like its a bad thing But even best case theyre behind both la teams and prob Denver We might have to already start looking to next year tho lol. Nurk and Zach aren't gonna give us anything this year The west is just loaded And we can't do much without them And as good as dame is Youve got two teams with two dudes better Its insane how good Dame is this year and how bad we are And a better cast Dame is gonna start falling off starting next year See Chris Paul for reference Yeah hes basically Darren collision now If we can trade for Love/gallo with whiteside picks and little. We're in good shape next year I wanna go big Trade Whiteside and Baze for Love, Thompson and Clarkson I hate Jordan Clarkson Thompson is nice tho ?This would be next year with a trade and we'd have a $200m payroll lol Have you guys noticed Whiteside and Baze for Thompson-Love works straight up Whiteside is truly capable of catching a pass cleanly He literally always bobbles it and has to recover I hate admitting it but we should have kept aminu Also the heat are better than the blazers now so thats fun! ? Same story different tune ? Let's be honest tho. What's gonna happen is we're gonna be 10 games under .500 at the All Star break. Dame is gonna go supernova and drag us to a 13-3 March. We finish the season crazy optimistic and sneak into the playoffs at 43-39 only to lose 4-1 in the first round Rinse and repeat next year ^^^^ ?? If there was some +320 bet on this somewhere Id put $100 down Lol whos gonna guard siakam tomorrow? Im drunk DM-ing rich to make this Tristan trade happen Drastic times Seriously tho Hezonja and Tolliver are so ass Idk how we fix it Whiteside is not as much of an issue As the 4 spot https://twitter.com/blazersbysagar/status/1194486055589670912?s=21 Sagar is the Oliver Maroney of Blazers twitter Thank god we have him to remind us of how sane we sre *are May have to get blocked by him For the culture ????

This whole Stephen Miller thing is so fucking stupid. Oh the guy that wrote blatantly racist speeches and policies for the president is racist? Cant believe it. EXPOSED Guys ugh Its kinda like betting against the ducks but ML for UCLA Utah is +965 UCLA has won 3 straight Each boy double digits Vs who Stanford, ASU and Colorado Not good teams but not complete scrubs either The thing is, its completely possible for UCLA to win that game because it would be the most pac12 thing ever Totally Yah good odds I like that bet And chip seems to finally have a put a coherent offense together UCLA could win the south with that win and a win over USC God that would fucking suck for us I know lol Thats the only thing stopping me Is it would basically knock us out of the playoff I dont wanna root for that! Yeah thats some bad juju you cant do that Take it back! Goddamnit I hate the pac12 so much lol Lol the ringer is giving The Mandalorian the full game of thrones treatment I cant make the bet just because of that Mandalorian was dope tho First so Ep* I havent seen yet obviously but I will probably do it Just gonna wait like a week Lol the ringer is so thirsty for any media Theyre always trying to make something the next thrones Thats now how it works *not lol yeah you dont get to pick something and make it the next thing. society decides.

Good he sucks Yeah I mean hes a shitty guy thats been arrested for worse stuff than this But its also bullshit to put someone away for four years on a weapons charge, especially for weapons he didnt obtain Brock what's your Kodak allegiance More of a Nikon guy myself Hes got some good songs I enjoy thats about it https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/28008681/32-nfl-one-hit-wonders-hillis-madden-cover-tyree-helmet-catch-more I actually like his music too I just think he's a bitch cuz he walked out of an interview when they asked him about sexually assaulting someone and he was talking shit about Lauren London right after nipsey died ??????? Yah he def not a good guy Yeah i agree hes not a great hill to die on But these charges have nothing to do with anything other than the weapons incident And 4 years is a lot of time to pay taxes on this dude for a weapons charge That's fair Lol Jim Jordan is the biggest fucking loser in Congress Anybody watching the impeachment hearings Jim Jordan can eat a dick Jim Joe Paterno Jordan Jordan, McCarthy, Scalise, Cheney, and ESPECIALLY Nunes are all total fuckheads Apparently Trump's favorites are; Nunes, Mark Meadows and Matt Gaetz. Tells you all you need to know about those 3 lol McCarthy is so dumb it's kinda funny.

Lol Train is always on schedule ! Can't watch anymore let's not even do the post game sad discussion tonight plz So I hit the raptors moneyline for 160 tonight Hey guys We still suck Raptors got no respect No ones watching siakam Hes gonna finish top 5 for mvp Thats so insane the highest drafted raptor on the floor rn Was 23 I feel like Siakam has gotten mad hype He just got a max contract I've heard mvp talk for him They were plus 3 against a 3-6 team that playing back to back after a loss to the kings Theyre 7-2 Thats not a lot of respect! That's Vegas I'm talking basketball pundits lol I mean Vegas reflects opinions generally Opinions of pleebs ?No respect They just pick a number that gets equal action on both sides Doesn't mean it's representative Psh Vegas is like the best metric for respect Very few of these guys consistently beat Vegas Most would lose if they were gamblers Lol dude my statement had nothing to do with gambling Im saying people dont see the raptors as an actual good team I'm talking people who write about basketball, talk about basketball for a living, have given Siakam mad props. He was pre season rated a top 20 player. And he got a max contract Fight! Fight! Fight! Bettors are different They prob arent gonna beat the Lakers or clippers but they could compete with anybody else We're fighting in diff arenas right now lol https://twitter.com/worldwidewob/status/1194846429094825984?s=21 God we suck A novelty wob name change is the biggest level of respect ? If his name is ever wobio Hezonja Ill cut my wiener off https://www.nbcsports.com/boston/celtics/nbas-top-100-players-2019-20-ranking-top-25#slide-18 Not in the top 25 Draymond at 15 Beal at 16 ? There u go chad ! https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/27691396/ranking-best-players-nba-season-30-11%3Fplatform%3Damp Lol okay ESPN had him ranked 22 ahead of Blake griffin Your hot take was Luke warm as fuck Chad this is just how space gets his rocks off at this point This is revenge for my Lavar ball take 2 years ago Suck on that space! The week night argue Honestly I respect it Lol Pascal might be top 10 I dont think people see how good he is, or how good the raptors are 22 is still lower than hes turned out to be So far Lol so people who pre season ranked him 22 aren't giving him respect cuz he should have been ranked above dame and PG? That's your take He can take over games, hes a top 5 defender Okay lol I didnt say anything above pg or dame? That's top 10 area Hes 22 Tho If he was 12 Yeah fair lol but hes turned out to be a lot better than 22 Which he'll be next year. That's why you play the games The raptors are 8-2 22 was mad respect off one season of 2nd banana Yeah lol And they arent favored in the games I'm a fan. You don't gotta sell me Right! But hes underrated either way If they arent favored in games, and he was underrated in the player rankings Despite being 7-2 Lol I won't concede that Properly rated pre season Max contract ? How is my conclusion that theyre not getting enough respect Vegas is diff from basketball pundits I digress So ducking crazy lol Fine man Lets look up the pundits predictions for tonights game Is there a source you prefer over Vegas As to who you think pundits think will won the game? Bc theres a big difference between saying nice words And picking a team to win a game! I just think selecting one random game, looking at the line, and making an assumption about how an entire league and country view a player is ridiculous lol that's all There's terrible lines across the league every night If only we listened to these esteemed pundits wed beat Vegas every time! Also when does the line apply to one player only We were the pundits this morning lol You're trying to say that Toronto +2 in November means Siakam is criminally underrated? Gimme a break He gets made love. People that watch basketball know he's legit ? Youre pulling words out of thin air They didnt get respect If you're talking about one game then sure lol they didn't get respect Was that it? Lol Did I manufacture an argument Thats what I said? I thought the top 5 mvp take was your arguemenr That's a soft take is what I was saying Oh lol Cuz that's pretty unanimously accepted Ok But if the line was all you were saying then yes I agree it was bad lol Harden, lebron, kawhi, Giannis Is siakam the unanimous 5th guy? Didnt realize it was that unanimous! I would say so. But people could argue AD and Joker are all interchangeable Or Embiid or PG Ducking Luka rn Luka is unreal I'm in a fragile state It's panic time for Portland so my grandma is having shoulder surgery in December and guess who the doctor is. The same guy who does the blazers shoulder surgeries including ZCs. Gundy can you please ask Terry what the timetable is for my grandmas return? Fuck Im crying Dubov Godspeed on your grandmothers recovery Speaking of knees I tripped on the subway steps this morning and banged my knee in front of everyone I had to limp up the steps it was so embarrassing Guys Regarding the blazers Is it time for the players only meeting Terry is giving them tomorrow off After the back to back I think everyone needs some self reflection Dame looking around seeing a bunch of scrubs It's cuz we didn't do the San Diego trip this year There's no chemistry! Lol hood was sick tho No fortnite parties at Meyers house ??

Your season officially saved! This is epic. We're America's team now Melo > Tolliver Melo Redemption run Also, this is the perfect comeback situation Or he could go full Antonio brown Are you fucking kidding me This is everything Me and Melo going shot for shot at Casa Diablo is all I want for Christmas Hes a fucking bum So is Hezonja! Our choices are Anthony the bum or other Anthony the bum I'll take the HOFer bum IM ALL IN ON THIS Pippen 2.0. Minus the defense Is it unreasonable to think that Melo will happily assume the role and play style of Kyle Korver? Im so out on this team HOODIE MELLOW GONNA FIT RIGHT IN IN COLD AS PORTLAND My entire twitter presence has been building to this I dont care if he sucks We also have a Hood on our team! If Rodney was super chill we would have Mellow Hoodie and Hoodie Melo BAHAHA Gundy write an article about melo leading the league into assists Use your prophetic power for good ! https://www.instagram.com/p/B43lL3Pqu8X/?igshid=1nscl6vviwj0c Glorious Except take off 7 Portland has no respect for their legends. We let meyers wear 11. We're back in the driver's seat in the west now Going to have a major Target on our backs Im worried about this seton hall team Were gonna have our hands full Yes we will Great coach too The ducks are taking Atlantis Porzingis with 18 with 9 left in the third! Lock! ?Number 1 hangover cure Kristaps hasnt gotten the ball since I said that Nice katsu Mark But my son is unconscious Omg KP put back slam One more point! Omg Japanese curry is my favorite Theres one spot in Portland that does a fire version: Kal Is that place good? Walked by a bunch of times but never tried Its dope Not an amazing space but the food is incredible Thats all I care about Ive never had the Japanese cure at Marukin but the Kal one is so damn good I dont even wanna try it *curry Its also nearby the downtown SERRA Which is key ? 30 gyoza bang bang? Clippers lose again? Lets go Lets check in with mo ? SUPER BET ?Current view Thats dope CB Also the Knicks won?!?!? ?Cursed season Please explain Dame6s No I refuse to believe I was very worried you were going to say that They look like my fucking water socks I bought off amazon ? Will Larry Steele let Melo wear 15? I met Larry Steele at hoopla one year. Cool guy Holy shit the Steelers and browns just went nuts Ahahah what a great fight Wow browns alive? Wow Garrett using the helmet as a weapon lol That was bs by Garrett Love how and buck all upset They should just do thunderdome God bless the Miami Heat Im disappointed But also 90 dollars richer for the jogger Night ? Oregon legend Carmelo Anthony Lebron buying the team is shaping up perfectly. Melo is gonna have a career revitalization. Play 3rd fiddle when we make a finals run next year and become blazer legend. Lebron buys the team in 5 years and Melo takes front office role Dubov tell me you can see it too I do not share the vision Everyone post predictions for highest Melo points in a game this year Ill go 14 https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter/status/1195205480328695811 24 39 28 Can I predict how many shots he takes... at least 27 shots one game 32 Actually no please let me take that back Lets make this gambling first 23 And a game winning J after 6 jab steps Ill go 30 He had 28 last year against the Nets I think If anyone hits it exactly ill send them a prize Melo is a cancer and hes about to take over the blazers 23 Dammit chad said 23 Hes done this to every team hes been on post Denver. Were gunna need some chemo therapy soon 25 You tell em doc! Houman we have aids we need the cancer to cure the aids But really we need someone at the 4 who isnt afraid Mario is afraid and Tolliver is an old role player Its non guaranteed Literally such a low risk play 17 Final answer Brock Mini website! I hope he gets cut by this time next week He is going to mess up the locker room. Do you think hes going to listen to dame? If yall had cancer you wouldnt try any means necessary to stay alive if it was basically gree? Everyone likes Melo free This is like saying oh you have cancer. Okay well keep drinking alcohol and smoking cigs. You will die quicker Its more of a style issue but style is a better problem than talent Well* I like alcohol and when im drunk I like cigs, whats your point? Nassir Little is our best PF! Hes a child! Its gonna be like Linsanity Oh you think melo
Is going to play D LOL Plus we get OKC, New York and Denver are home all in a row We need help offensively too We need all the help we just got hood back We are literally playing 4-on-5 every night the way teams guard dame We lost because dame didnt play like dame Playoff defense is now the norm Cj is also playing terrible The whole season. He is missing shots he has been normally hitting Im just saying teams have played a box and 1 against us the last 4 games cause they disrespect everyone else If hood was out like zack then yes I would agree with getting melo. But not when hood just got back Everyone but Dame has been playing like shit And mostly everyone else has been limp dick when they get a chance 1v1 Has anyone proven that they need to be guarded outside of Dame? Last night dame literally had to yell attack! At hezonja You think melo is going to require guarding His shooting percentage will be worse than cjs Melo is happy to be a bench guy You gotta remember this is melo, who doesnt hit open 3s Hes just not that good Who takes wild shots.... this isnt melo from Denver I dunno the blazers look so bad rn but I still think they squeak into the playoffs But ethier way. We will see how it turns out I think we are getting a little ahead of ourselves. What we are doing obviously isnt working. 23 year old melo isnt walking thru that door.. we know Houman We just know the other 4s we have arent even nba players now with Collins done Its just gonna take a while for them to gel its like a new team Give the future Hall Of Famer a shot 10x All-Star
6x All-NBA Its been 12 games!! Is melo a hall of famer? What have Tolliver and hezonja ever done? Congrats! And he hasnt played for 12 months That says more than anything else Definitely Ian - olympics Dwight was also a free agent until august and hes been amazing for the Lakers 30 teams all Said no to him I dunno dont get me wrong This is definitely a fun move Dwight personality is diff. He is much more passive Might as well give it a shot when its guys last chance Melo is cocky, always has been. He thinks hes the greatest player But I dunno I dont see it changing much Basketball is easy to get in - plus he won the title for Syracuse and boeheim I was responding to Ians HOF question How many points is he gonna score for who? The blazers? Well when Myles Garrett gets suspended from the NFL, he could play power forward Julius Peppers 2.0 Hes gonna score more points for the Beijing Ducks this year than the blazers Just wait til he mistakes meyers Leonard for mason Rudolph Oh Jesus Christ speaking of scoreless, Kristaps went scoreless in the fourth and I lost by .5 ? https://twitter.com/archillect/status/1195214939344048130 Jets marketing team getting creative Melo is going to be so good were gonna trade CJ You heard it here first Melo blown off those German suppositories, he got the plug from Kobe https://twitter.com/rotoworld_fb/status/1195202525009305600?s=21 Omg What a headline u love to see it Melo getting Houman to contribute a years worth of texts in one night is enough satisfaction for me The Doctor is in. Cant wait to see Lala at the Lakers game around Christmas No bodegas in Lake Oswego Especially since she got killed in power. She doesn't have anything else to do Spoiler alert I stopped watching power but that was building lol https://twitter.com/TG3II/status/1195204732735885312 We are AMERICAS TEAM! https://www.wweek.com/sports/2019/11/14/destiny-fulfilled-carmelo-anthony-is-finally-a-portland-trail-blazer/ https://twitter.com/nickcocco18/status/1195166274017472512?s=12 Dude I fucking love Power Tommy is the man FUCK.

Joel Freeland did not die for this Number not official yet 69 Imagine if we had Melo and Pau 5 years ago Scottie pippen and Sabonis 2.0 It's all shaping up for game 7 WCF against the Lakers. Except this time dame throws an oop to a cutting Melo and we win in dramatic fashion. Avenging ghosts of Portland past Who is bonzi Baze = Bonzi Hood is lefty Steve smith Hezonja is Schrempf Omg it's happening No sheed tho Zach comes back. White sheed He's got some crazy in him We play the rockets on Monday. Carmelo going for 25 And blazers still lose by 15 Nuh uh https://www.instagram.com/p/B42uGbogi5L/?igshid=wucqivl68x1m I wish Dame had better taste in shoes... Multi talented but I think his eyes are broken. Yall need to stop with this nonsense Dont bring those legends into this dumpster fire Detlef Schrempf was on parks and recreation goddamnit Sonic legend Detlef Schrempf Him and Chris Mullen carried the white boy flat top torch Wait did anybody hear Meyers is renting Whitesides house in Miami? Lol Total Meyers move Did they house swap? Find out this Sunday on HGTV Did whiteside keep his fish!? I'll give Republicans this, they're good at sticking to their talking points.

Stephen A and Max debate next Trial by Chapter Lol honestly Im just impressed by mason Rudolphs psycho rage Like the look on his face we he attacked garret Is Rudolph really considering pressing charges? Lol That was not a fake fight lol I dont think he is lol Yeah no I think its everyone else The bus driver video guy needs to reenact it in a public park with the little person Manager just has to posture and show he's doing his due diligence He really whacked him tho! Oh absolutely lmao But someone made a point theres a reason theres a rule about using your helmet as a weapon God I need deadspin rn to tell me what to think Im so lost Yeah lol, I mean if you wanna use that same logic Its not unprecedented or whatever like Schefter was saying Saw over under for supsesion was 5.5 games! About like how this would be prosecuted off the field Hammer that over!! Like he might get off on self defense? Its dumb Its a situation unique to football Yah thats a stupid conversation imo Yeah I think thats the important point We all know the NFL has sovernty in their stadiums Like if we wanna have a talk lol Is should be about like should we continue playing football at all lol Or go back to leather helmets baby! There is way more violent shit than this lol I liked Pablo Torres take https://twitter.com/pablotorre/status/1195204562799538176?s=12 All I know is I cant stop watching this video Hahaha yeah thats perfect https://twitter.com/arianfoster/status/1195219933438849024?s=12 Arian Foster's feed is great too Brings up the fact that baseball players beam each other with fastballs on purpose lol So much to watch Pounce just throwing haymakers Thats a great point. Baseball players throwing at people is actually way worse imo 25 on the browns comes in and takes a cheap shot at Rudolph at the end I like pouncy trying to kick miles in the face lol DeCastro with the takedown Bellevue Washington baby! Only hard ass motherfuckers come from Bellevue Bellingham tougher Mercer island boys don't fuck around Mercer Island lacrosse baby LEGENDS I say Give his ass 8 games Like you cant clobber someone with a helmet but also ????? Yah def need to make sure he doesnt play this year again 8 games works for me! If they go to the Super Bowl They can have him back lol Yeah thats fine He shouldnt play this year but the whole banned for life thing is a bit much Lol okay over 5.5 games is -500 now Seems like an easy way to make $20 on $100 tho Honestly I think he should get a game or two back because its such a great video Thats a mortal lock unless the players union has some card up their sleeve Seriously the best sports film of the decade Right again love Joe buck and troy oh my this was such a great game until this terrible event happened!! Disgusting people at home have to see this I feel horrible Mean while fox showing every angle in slo mo, everyone at home loving it I know lol Its the classic hate to see it moment Front page of the USA Today photo data base is Garrett swinging the helmet lma Lmaoo https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dmqGg6Ccvw That was a disgusting act!

And the playoffs lolbrowns Suspend him for next year too. Or part of next year All browns players suspended from playoffs Wow Sierra Canyon has 15 games this year on ESPN 3 lol Some interesting lines The sixers -3.5 Theyve been really shaky lately I just realized I'm gonna get to see Melo in a blazers uniform and his return to Denver Video tribute?? Ok Just threw 100 one spurs +135 moneyline I think its pretty good, theyre playing the magic No significant I jures Injuries Same Also Threw them in a 10 team parlay in solidarity with gundy Haha Hornets moneyline could be interesting ? You can get them at +155 on Bovada Blake is back Lol Gundy get on this action with me. I'm feeling lucky Im tempted to just hit rockets moneyline -235 Yeah just hit it And then a separate hit on rockets -5.5 Dubov free Nike ad idea it's just a bunch of clips of people walking the long way to things to avoid walking on grass / dirt / etc and you don't know why because you don't show until the end and then the big reveal is it pans down and they're wearing super fresh nikes Probably already been done but I just did that IRL in my way in the office so made me think of it JCSL Agency would make MILLIONS Daily struggle matty I think everyone would know that from the begging but its a cool ad I wouldnt make it like a big reveal tho Speaking of sneakers, Chad can you let me know your thoughts on the Dame6s? Am I the only one who hates them? What would you do besides a big reveal Space? Just typical b-roll feel with feet in frame? I'm not a fan either Cam. Not sure what they were going for there I think the 4's and 5's were pretty dope The bape 4's were fire Agree with chads take Think cams water shoes are actually fire tho Hahaha Thanks Brock I also am partial to the 1s Why no big reveal Ian Big reveals are cool The midget grown ass man on the school bus taught me that The 2s werent bad but they werent anything special Probably because he has a big reveal in the daily when people realize hes not a child but In fact a grown ass man matty https://youtu.be/GFNdPsh8eew This remains to this day the best ad of all time Very true Cam WTFFFF/1!! Space loves it That isnt real right As far as space and I could ascertain it is real I do love this Yeah its real I mean I think at least Its a perfect thing Matt post the chopped up version It kills me lol Omg Thats incredible DAVID the agency Miami did it Im going to think about this ad for the rest of my life Lemme find it space Lol also I dunno chad Id prob more focus on the shit hes avoiding Make it kinda hyperbolic/fantastical, I just think if you see a guy avoiding puddles and grass and stuff your first thought is that its to avoid fucking up his shoes, so you dont need to hide that to make it cool https://youtu.be/iT-jrDFgkq4 ^the edit (warning might make u think you're losing your mind) Uhhhh Hahaha Thats epic What CEO shows up to the office first? This commercial could have a series of books in the same universe HAHAHA The internet is an amazing place https://twitter.com/yahoosportsnba/status/1195411765686870017?s=12 Red Bulls Pippen Falcons #7 custom jersey with PETA as the name Ricky waters Reversible Jordan/Grant Hill Rashard Lewis Blazers pippen is the first u remember.

Shoulda trailed me and space Ugh I didnt hit Charlotte And San Antonio blew it Big money on the rockets tonight tho So lets not fuck that up! Im getting obliterated today Well consult some experts next time! The experts are the reason Im getting obliterated The east is really bad Don't summon him! You mustnt speak his conferences name ! Lol I mean the East is def worse than the west But what about tonight made you say that? The Beast of the East is awaken Sixers going to OT against the thunder Yeah theyve been rocky for a while now But the top 5 in the East has been pretty dominant Also philly is pulling away However I dig this mentality This is how you get raptors +3 at Portland ?? Lol also Since Monday Im on a $650 heater But I just got greedy and hit the Celtics -7 We need a little more for you to cover the rip city row ?? Let it ride space Also tho I just got hornets +150 moneyline against the Knicks tomorrow I have no idea who wins that game But thats a good value God what a terrible game The Knicks are v bad Uh oh Deangelo Russells got a a crazy look in his eye Kings +405 The liga loves the big payouts lol I put 235 on the rockets -235 to win 100 And yes they covered But still I got my 100 Plus I hit them against the spread for 50 ?

I have no hope Anything -6 or below ?? ?? The King !!!! God hes so much cooler than Kobe LE BARON Watching the game with my Lakers buddies , just met the rarest Lakers fan of all time I've ever met Hardcore Lakers fan, hates Kobe hates Phil I'm honestly flabbergasted Did he get into the nba late? No lifetime fan Like I dont hold any sentiment for the Heatles Oh lol Wow Im gonna smoke another bowl Odd fan I'm confused What's the basis of his Kobe hate. I'm genuinely curious now Was it the rape? His style of play? Does he think they should have kept shaq? Does he not like winning? Yeah or Phil for that matter lol I mean he flamed our Out Two things he said - only successful cuz of shaq and took the late career big money contract that hamstringed the franchise for 5-6 years But Phil was never bad Hes like a republican that wants universal healthcare Also said he wasn't clutch And then the other 2 guys said u gotta stop or we're gonna have to ask you to leave Hahaha I thats kinda rich lol Kobe did fine without shaq Hating a dude for taking money is so 2004 Haha yeah he carried them to 2 more ships post shaq during Duncan's prime, the Celtics big 3, and lebron beginning to peak Ok heres a cool line Raptors +3.5 @ Dallas I asked about the Shaq thing He said that Pau is a HoF big man too So same argument applies Space whats your bankroll/bet ratio look like Are you laying over 10% a given game Oh well Ive been playing with the hawks winnings Im making big bets Rn Since Monday Im up to 648 Without losing But Ive got 100 on Celtics -7 and 50 on Celtics money line Houseofhighlights and sportscenter have same LeBron highlight with same caption and even same emoji wtf Nice. Crazy guy on betting pod I listened to ran a million $ baseball betting hedge fund for a year Playing caption chicken? Never bet more that 1% bankroll on a gaem Its is pretty crazy like if you dont protect yourself with low % bets you will go bankrupt almost guarantee Een if you hit 70% the odds you lose 8 games in a row over a season is very large Yeah You have to make a decision early Not that thats the point I understand What youre willing to make and lose But the odds math is crazy ?From my buddy at the UCLA game The same guy has said "that's his spot" on two separate Danny green 3s and he's missed them both This is wild Did u guys see Mo swagners line Yeah I had to double take that Washington has been filling it up this year The fuck lol Getting 100 shots up in a game is impressive Next move is trade bazemore for Tristan Thompson and sign JR ? We need gallo And JR I want ENERGY Gimme all former Knicks and nuggets Tristan is like the perfect playoff power forward Hes like Ed Davis but not skinny If we miraculously turn things around Tristan is the ultimate Al Horford stopper Just saying Am I a boomer if I say that there are too man goddamn threes? Nope its true Thats the new meta Too many guys who suck at shooting taking 3s Ok boomer Kings!!! We need to throw the bag at Bogdanovic this summer They cant Pay him God they got screwed That was an obvious fou Foul Hometown call BS Ugh I was up 150 before I hit the late games However 60 bucks and a night of quality entertainment Not bad!

Atlanta +430 Lol Dylan is your whole strategy just betting on trash teams? Atlanta is like a good bad team tho They just beat Denver on the road and should have beaten us Theyre not that bad! Also lol, I hit Utah I didnt put enough to make me root for them I mean UCLA But its +970 BOOOOOOOOO Dude sac almost won last night! If Utah loses its all your fault Yeah I had a nice 150 dollar night until I got greedy and hit the night games Yeah and Atlanta is a good bad team ? Back on the piss Heat are getting -7 I need that to move like half a point Mark how many days are you there? 9 days total https://twitter.com/collegegameday/status/1195706609781137409?s=12 The ultimate safety school Ok you should do this for me If you to the JRL To Funabashi Which is kinda outside Tokyo Theres a restaurant called kiko Its a standing sushi place Was my fav meal It ruled so hard ?? ?? Heat -5.5 At home The only way I can sum up the Tokyo food scene is I have been eating $1 sushi all week which shits on the $200 omakase I had in San Francisco Yeah Do this for me mark! I wouldnt recommend it if it was dank af! Remember Miami!? Funabashi might as well be Kuala Lumpur Haha owned Lol thats deep Ian Favorite part of japan mark? We should get a bro trip out there Yea JCSL Tokyo would be... loose TokyBro I would go in a second Japan is my wet dream of a country We know Cam. We know. Cam loves the Asian cuisine Japan is dope. Im going in January. Im a reincarnated Asian boys I swear. I must have been good in my past life to come back as a white man. Dylan you and the fam doing Tokyo? Is David vanderpool the real reason the blazers are slipping and Wiggins is on fire?? ? Did you find him in Aokigahara? Thats my boy Yuki. He works in HR at Hennessy and has been buying us drinks for the last two nights Absolute legend Looks like a boss Oh shit if Tua is hurt Bama might be done for the playoff Apparently he was screaming in pain apparently Watching penn st game - their rb had a 10 td game in high school and the final score was 107-90 damn Indiana fucked this game up in the 3rd quarter I just turned it on when they scored last. Whats they do? TCU needs to close this out My Textech under is in danger They had a 4th and short around midfield. Wasted a timeout to figure out what they wanted to do and then ran a terribly executed fake punt. PSU go the ball back and scored two plays later. O damn And they have the best punter in college football lol I havnt seen an LSU game Is joe burrow really the number one pick No. But he is the Heisman winner. Sure. CBS has burrow number one Saw hes older than Lamar Jackson haha CBS probably has 10 SEC guys going 1-10 5 but yes lol You cant draft Tua after having jameis for 6 years right He might not be worth a top 10 but I think he will be good in nfl - he runs pretty well when needed I mean, yeah I think he will be good in the NFL. But I would never waste a #1 pick on him Chase young should go #1 Burrow looks like best QB IMO, but I feel like cinci or Miami might tank again for Lawrence I have lost every time I have ever bet against temple Fuck Bill Cosby. Fuck Philly. Thats fair dehaan but Lawrence has been kinda average this year If you think burrow will be good hes worth a number 1 overall Why? I agree Rengel. Cuz QB matters so much more than any other position in NFL Cause every good qb is worth a number one Well shit Herbert still might get that pick then What if you dont need a QB Most teams picking in top 3 need a QB Then trade down Herbert isnt going to be a good pro The bears are prob willing to give up a lot to move into the top 2 for their pet pick I would 100% trade down before taking burrow #1 Yeah but if you dont want burrow, probably wont get an amazing haul from someone moving up to #1 Hes good but hes not going to turn around a franchise Agree, burrow reminds me of tannehill Minus the smoking hot wife Okay well if you think hes tanehillwthen dont draft him at all! Imagine drafting nick bosa over Kyler Murray https://youtu.be/rz5TGN7eUcM Clemson and Georgia bout to go down simultaneously Gundy saying apparently twice in the same sentence Lol but if Im the bengals or dolphins, am I ok taking a DE or tackle and praying for a QB next year? I It just depends on your internal assessment of the QBs I think chase young is smart cuz Burrow is a one year wonder, but if you are sold that he can be good he absolutely should go first Right Totally Better off taking multiple chances at QB on potential franchise guys vs any other position Chase young should probably be the pick I like how the Niners picked d lineman in the top 10 like 4 years in a row. Now their D is elite I think so too with this QB group, but I wouldve said Kyler still over chase young if Kyler was this year. And one of them was a bust Niners d line is nuts, but they probably lose 1st playoff game when jimmy G cant throw a TD I like Jerry jeudy on the giants Scones Jones to Juedy fantasy dreams Or jets! Jets will go O line I feel I hope Clemson gets the piss beat out of them go Deacs Dabo Swinney pregame probably - I just want to say its bullshit that they are giving kaepernick a tryout today Yes TEch under just hit That Kap workout has caused me to work on a Saturday which I dont appreciate. Im surprised that the NFL didnt tell all 32 teams to send somebody to the workout Oh and my Temple over hit also Cant believe we lost to bo nix Raptors are +4.5 rn Wait so Kap changed the workout location last second? What's going on The NFL would allow media and wanted him to sign a non-standard waiver so he said fuck yall and went with plan b at his own workout Wouldn't* allow media correct? Seems fair for him to bail then Yeah sorry Would not Gotcha. Just wanted to make sure I was following Seems very dramatic tho Idk the details of the waiver they wanted him to sign I just know it wasnt a standard medical waiver I'm not sure if he's purposely being stubborn or if Goodell is being a cock sucker Or maybe a little of both Kap is not easy to work with, but this was all the NFLs doing Interesting They set this entire thing up to make it look like Kap isnt blackballed Clay Travis is gonna have a field day with this Oh yeah for sure. Fuck the shield The whole 2 hour ultimatum was so strange too Damn Tua done for season https://youtu.be/MFjqDc_hwho Put Kaep on the bears Dubov I also worked today #solidarity Or on the Steelers Rudolph sucks I'm working a charity boxing tournament tomorrow between the LAPD and LASD Hoping there's a loud Chris tucker rush hour esque LAPD boxer Gimme Kap in Denver How far does Tua fall in the draft now? 2021 I dont think this drops him at all Yeah I agree with Clayton I think hes still a top 3 prospect Its not like its a lingering issue nfl front offices are smarter than that If he slides, bellicheck will trade up and get him The bengals should sign Kaep and draft tua Dehaan has insider Mexicalis that say otherwise Medicals My brother is a hip surgeon and says that injury will change him for brother Forever Damn Then nevermind! Lol But he could be wrong! Some twitter doctors were saying its potentially career ending Yeah crazy Steve young 2.0 no more Guys I had the same injury in 8th grade I didnt know what the injury exactly was until just now And look how you ended up I had what the doctor at the time called the bo Jackson injury https://twitter.com/jimnagy_sb/status/1195807410088226817?s=21 You know what? I was 13 so I think I ended up healing better lol Whats your handicap these days Clay did bounce back to be our No. 1 receiver freshman year Lol So obviously that means Tua can be in the NFL obviously Handicap as in golf? Lol Im like a 15. Last summer was a low point tho bouncing back this winter. Erectile dysfunction* I do have that, but its more uncontrollable adult boners I think TOO MUCH blood flow I've been unable to gain an erection ever since the blazers season began ?? Do you think committee drops Bama now even if no more loss? Nah Its bama They won a championship benching a Brianna finalist in the second half for a freshman Yah whos to say the backup isnt twice as good Bama could win 11 games by 1 point and they would get in over a pac 12 champ Texas is so not back https://twitter.com/CHold/status/1195831522613506049 I think this is Melos jersey number Good choice to not go 7 Respect for the fellow warrior in battle b-Roy Yeah fuck Kanter Ideal start to the Melo era by not choosing 7 The energy would be too resentful from Blazers dans *fans Hes already assuming his role which is a good sign Kevin Duckworth wore 00 ??

Wow fuck Brad Stevens he just ruined my parlay God smart had the layup and it just missed, bounced on like every inch of the rim What a brutal beat He had a timeout idk why he didnt advance the ball and get the play you want Not a knock on Marcus smart but a runner from him is not your best option Ugh got gouged on my big Celtics bet Won some back on the sixers But its gonna be a 300 loss for me However still a great week! They definitely tried to let Kemba get something and he got stoned so they just kinda scrambled to get the smart shot Unfortunate sorry guys I needed them at 2.5 Its happens It* Its good to take a L from time to time The start of a glorious Celtics slump and a season under Lol nah theyre pretty good Like theyre super deep Hayward hasnt even been healthy Heres the ?? tomorrow tho Bucks -7 @ bulls Im worrying about the under Yah its fucked but Im still holding hope The bulls are fucking horrible And are only getting single digits because theyre at home Jim Boylen is such a joke Milwaukee is like an hour and.

Wait who paid Dubov Hit me with that request Why do yall think Im in first place? Commish is rewarding good behavior. I just beat Brock so Im the lineal title holder right? Gundy Im
Not in fantasy This is your superliga sub fee. You get a free fantasy league entry included Yeah lol, what is this Venmo request? Ive insisted Im not invoked for like 3 years now lol I didnt send you one Houman Yea you did lol I just declined it Fake news Oh I didnt see it on incomplete Same Ian Ive never paid one year This is a coup ? Lets protest Its 30 bucks for a league that provides 25 weeks of content for us And is the reason we have the chat I thought we had the chat so we could gamble Gamblingliga* Haha guys pay your dues Especially you Dylan. You haven't paid live out in years Hahahahhaah you think I owe you 30 dollars for the content of this chat? Its the to the winner of the league Dude Ive literally asked you to not include me in the fantasy league, my team name is willing participant! Ive literally never played a week ^^^^ So you admit you have a team Same ?? Lawyered! You think youre better than everyone else! Ive literally never won this league or finished in the money Its about the league Also jimmy what is your Venmo My man, Ive never even set a roster I literally said I dont want to be in the league Why dont you? Is it that hard? Because I dont want to play lol Omg are we gonna DA space Not gonna like I think I'd vote no. He bring a lot to the group Just saying Im just saying 30 dollars is piss in a pot when youre dropping 150 dollar bets every night on games lol Ahhh the gambling tax Its just a different form of gambling! Except its social! I know man but I dont participate lol My name which hasnt changed for two years is willing participant Ok man I wasnt exactly thrilled to be the commish either but Im glad I did because I love the league and this chat The pot will be divided by percentage since two teams wont pay Thats not gonna be an effective guilt trip lol If Ian gets kicked out of the SuperLiga are we still gonna go to the heat game in February? This is the Superligas loss of Chinese sponsorship moment Decrease of the cap Ian if you got kicked out of the group chat would we ever talk again? I would probably text you for gambling advice Alright but if you win the league Ian you get nothing I hope you are prepared for that Whos gonna make fun of me for engaging with brands? The yahoo app literally has AI now it couldnt be easier to set your lineup lol We get it you guys are too busy and cool to do something that takes literally no time What the hell man whats wrong with not playing!? Its not like I said I was and then bailed lol Panthers blew up my 4 team parlay today Almost hit +1200 ?? I just got mad man its fine sorry for blowing up Its all good I took my cowboys and jets money and went all in on the pats so Im up this weekend Smh Ian wins some money now he thinks billionaires shouldnt pay taxes Ian the group was started as a fantasy basketball chat Now you don't wanna pay your fair share I see how it is When is Melo gonna play Tuesday In NOLA Hes missing the Houston game O/U 59.5 points? They also still havent announced the signing Wait what? They are doing his physical today and tomorrow But like when Woj has it its done They just havent sent the press release out Why is his physical 2 days long The ol trump physical eh. Multiple stages Hawks +1050 live right now Trae young hasnt hit shit theyre only down 10 Lets hit that shit! Theyre down 25 again I love that Dwight is lovable again Quite the Redemption story Prequel to Melos redemption story Then spaceman Spaceman cannot be redeemed He is irredeemable Omg they benched trubisky lamo This is hilarious Lmao he looks like he was crying You just hate to see it Ian is making the same case I made when Tudor tried to DA me senior year for not coming to chapter. I told you I wasnt going to. Hawks ?????? I just dipped on +1400 I was one Celtics bounce away from going undefeated today. Sorry man Celtics fucked me too Feb-00 2-1 but my 1 was my big boy bet 200 loss on the day Still a profitable day 1-May Cavs +3, bucks -8, Celtics +3.5, thunder +10 parlay pays x13 You have Gundys attention Were back Whyd you let the bucks get to -8!? Im not betting nba just passing along Ugh Celtics have burned me twice now but Im gonna hit em moneyline an way Anyway* ? Ian you are in major trouble my friend No way celts drop back to back games right? At Phoenix is a tough one The Celtics are very good tho I agree its not a sure thing at all But it feels like good value rn Hawks lost like every game last week so Im in the red no doubt Damn the Nuggets TV (altitude) and Comcast ain't getting resolved anytime soon. Altitude sued Comcast saying they're purposely holding out to eliminate altitude as a network or purchase them at a severely discounted rate Space your dad works for the devil! Lmaoo When the Walmart vertical integration goes too far Kroenke just wants to wants to own every inch of Nuggets broadcasts and it backfired lol He owns altitude Cause theyre not on Directv or anything either right? ?On my Gundy bullshit They worked out a deal with direct tv! The Knicks are like the only team that can pull off owning their broadcast because James Dolan made his money in cable tv But yes Kroenke fucking sucks dick Oh I didnt know that Im so glad the blazers finally got their shit together Removed a heart from Im so glad the blazers finally got their shit together Ive also heard the Nuggets org is notoriously cheap But no Dish or Comcast yet Death to the P12N! Like the old man Stan has to approve everything they spend money on lol I hope all conference networks die Wait Pac 12 is done?!? But ESPECIALLY the Pac 12 Network The Walmart heirs are cheap fuckers. Who would have thought haha No, this is my wish. Oooh okay lol It will never happen because Larry Scott has a fetish for burning money. I still think its hilarious that the P12 wanted Utah and Colorado to get the SLC and Denver media markets yet half of the conference territory cant even get their stupid fucking channel. https://twitter.com/THEKIDMERO/status/1196469467200544768 What do we think of the Melo props ? Via gundya twitter Under. No. Yah seems like lock territory for under Not up on vada You think he gets cut mid season Dubov? Yeah theyre just BetOnline right now Ill go no limit with anyone in here who wants that over Whats the date to make his contract fully guaranteed? January something? I think he either gets cut or bails because he hates it Yeah mid January We will see. You get humbled when youre out of the league for a year. I know its Melo but thats a hit to anyones ego Yeah I'm cautiously optimistic Did anyone read the Woj column from the weekend? Not often I agree with Chris Vernon, but in this case I do. Portland is desperate and if were desperate for Melo, were gonna get the full Melo Experience. It was basically a message from Neil to Melo. We saved your ass so dont fuck it up. I see it the other way around. Melo thinks (whether its right or wrong) that hes saving our ass. https://t.co/mouR1oGw4a?amp=1&ssr=true Were totally getting a Woj column on Tuesday From the debut Everybody is gonna have a hot take tomorrow morning Cant wait to hear what Stephen A. has to say. Oh man They should flex the game tomorrow to nba tv I just put Stephen A on lol His entire first hour has been predictably about Kap I hope he has some Melo tales in the 2nd hour I agree with you gunz. I think Neil was telling Melo we saved him and they're on the same page That said Melo is Melo Who knows what could happen Right we just have to hope he had the same come to Jesus moment as Dwight I'm happy for Dwight If only he had this realization 5 years ago Dwight can still be in the league 5 more years Definitely. Dude is in insane shape He'll be able to grab 10 boards a night when he's 45 $100 on Chiefs -4.5 tonight if anyone wants chargers let me know Yeah dude Dwight stopped eating candy everyday and started doing yoga and shit lol Im a pessimist and the #1 Carmelo Anthony hater so I do not see this ending well. I think its absolutely ridiculous to even hope this will work out Haha I forgot how much you hated this signing. Touch I mean history says it won't. But we got nothing to lose IMO The thing that matters most is it literally cant be worse than the minutes Hezonja and Tolliver were giving What gundy said I will say this for the 237th time. Anthony Tolliver is not an NBA player Things can always get worse. And the fact that he was starting for us! Also Nas has never played 82 games before We need some kind of insurance policy if he has to miss a game or something But if you read the fine text the policy doesnt cover defense , passing, ball movement and acts of god Hezonja and Tolliver are FEMA level disasters ?Looks like Melo made it to Portland safely Air out those grievances! Festivus almost here! https://www.sporttechie.com/nba-top-shot-dapper-labs-blockchain-digital-collectibles/ Is Derwin playing tonight? No indication Ahh okay I thought I saw something that he was back hit that was premature I guess He was eligible to return a couple weeks back but still not full participant Im just remembering last years chargers chiefs game Probably the game of the year Yah I almost feel like hes worth 2 wins for the chargers minimum Last call for chargers action Need a big second half from my Cavs I hate this hornets team so fucking much Damn got approved today for an apartment Moving to Brooklyn yall RIP The Bronx but also RIP The Bronx Subway ride Yeah Ill miss it for sure Bronx has heart But Ive had enough of my apartment complex lol And good ass cheap food Yeah I mean Im not in Williamsburg or anything Its not Bronx cheap but its not super bad Aint no Ichiran in the Bronx!!! Ian you gotta find a good Colombian bakery in Brooklyn If thats possible lol Dude Brooklyn is the size of Chicago it would be the most diverse city in America even if Manhattan didnt exist lol There is plenty of food of all varieties to be found in Brooklyn I will miss the Bronx too lol! But you can def find gems in Brooklyn Oh of course My homie Brett lives in bush wick now he took me to Gladys Most fire jerk chicken Ive ever had Yeah lol tho I should say Jerk fried Im in park slope Oh near the legendary park slope co-op So its kinda vanilla and by vanilla I mean the shade Yeah its def more Portlandy where Im at Sorry lol that sounded like a diss Its not It just isnt like bushwick It was only a matter of time before Space moved to Brooklyn! Like a moth to a flame! Robyn Lopez just a knockdown 3 shooter now lol No wonder I got such good odds on this parlay. It was a shit bet! Knockdown Divencenzo! Where is Carmelo Show yourself! Lol they still havent announced the signing Skal! Jesus they have to start Hezonja Rio Hes not cool enough for that *stop So announce it and roll his ass out there! I want to be proven wrong! God watching Harden is like doing taxes I go back and forth between appreciating and hating him so often I hate watching him Almost as much as I hate watching this parlay update. God this is the worst bet Ive ever made. Jfc rivers Swear to god he always kills against us Oh this is Phillip not Austin? Lol excuse me lol Schrodinger's Rivers ? Calabro just called Capela Schroeder lmaooo https://twitter.com/teelittle0608/status/1196612633060945920?s=12 Calabro has misidentified a number of players this year He did it in Spurs game too, confused gay and derozan Called him Rudy homosexual Well hey we got New Orleans tomorrow I love Nas Is Calabro turning into mike rice in front of our eyes How bout that bucks -7 bitches!?!?!? How bout that Boston moneyline! Bucks -8.5 was one of my rare hits in the parlay but if Boston ML closes out it will cancel out the parlay! Good call space Lol I hit it for 500 Gotta play with your profits! Why is space sports betting rain man Lol 1 month in hes moving to manhattan Lol I mean its prob just mostly luck and the fact that any result is as likely as any other But I will say, once youre up a little You gotta let it ride on one line you really like And then you can start really playing Also lol Dont spend any of it until youve cashed out https://twitter.com/adamcward/status/1196608939468578816?s=12 Wow bazemore a dirty player Gotta suspend him not and send a message I paid my Superliga fee, but let it be known RIGHT NOW This is the last time I pay for this fantasy basketball league I did this for my own gambling karma and not because of any of your guilt trips or threats! Lol I lost to gunz this week because Ive got 4 guys hurt Fucking BS Ahahah Dont Go setting that lineup this week Next week We can have Chad get on skype with you and teach ya the ropes Lolol watch out! Im comin for ya! Congrats on the karma tho We all know gundy lawyered up and you cracked 5-1 today. 6-1 yesterday. My only Ls were both NBA parlays.

Fuck fuck fuck Melo getting 20 on 8 shots you heard it here first Im gonna lose my shit on his first jab step If Mello has a game it is going to be tonight God lets just hope the pelicans are so bad Yeah Nico Melli is slow and not good on defense I put 300 on that shut Shit But he can shoot so we need Melo to close out more like 8 points on 20 shots I'm an intrigued for Melo but no dame I'm feeling a broy Mavericks playoff performance Is this is the most anticipated blazers debut ever? Sidebar: Dubov why does Tottenham suck all of a sudden It has to be right? Yes 100% this is more exciting than Bill Waltons first game Gundy did you just completely block the greg oden era out of your mind? Dude idk Mark I havent had time to watch many games this season but the lineup has been wildly inconsistent Yes honestly I have But as a free agent I dont think theres ever been one As big as this The GO debut was a must see event Scottie Pippen maybe? Drazen? Was he drafted technically or signed? Maybe but I honestly think Melo is more famous now than Scottie was in 1999.mostly because Melo was a Knick and beloved in New York I would rather have Greg oden on a bum leg using his massive dong to balance than let Melo out there same Lol Dubov Burch just bought a Carmelo blazers 77 throwback ?? Fucking vintage Thats the most burch thing Ive ever heard 1000% The green biofreeze patch is really a bummer They dont have them on the ones you can buy from nba.,9 Nba dot com Or Nike either Ahh Fuck those retro Rip Cities are sick Glad I held off on the red. Those are sick. Just got 100 level tix to nuggets blazers in 2 weeks. $30 each haha Were the scrubs coming to town So sad but good for the brothers pockets Is the line against Miami in February gonna be like +7.5?

God damn I love Terry Stotts Not fun anymore? Call 1-800-......... The offensive wizard Just gonna let Melo cook Guarantee first play is for him What happens when the offensive wizard meets the offense stopper ...can we bet on that? It's a 16 footer fadeaway that gets partially blocked / airball Where is Ruben Patterson the Kobe stopper. Except that melo is his own stopper I would bet all of my $5000 in site credit on that Matt Over under 2 jab steps before he pulls the trigger? Over I need 3 I making the kids do jab step drills at practice tonight Followed by fadeaway shooting drills And then transition defense drills where they just stay on the offensive end of the floor Guys if Melo drops 30 in a win I will open this bottle like its 2003 ?

Well reconvene for the next meeting of the I Hate Melo Club on Thursday during the battle of the two most diverse cities in North America. Yeah goddamn fucking Lillard injury Brutal ? I looked at both plans and my dad's plan is better Sails out, nails out, bro https://twitter.com/spursofficial/status/1197040181657784320?s=12 This is so wild Im sick Gary Sondland out here with the receipts!!! Portland's own Gary Sondland! He don't give af That cuck better find a place to live that isnt portland He's the savior we needed. National hero Hes partially responsible for this mess If the republicans were smart (yuge if, I know) they would immediately discredit his testimony by asking why he changed it so many times If Nunes, Jordan and Ratcliffe all put their heads together. They could create one semi competent person The best part of this is that Jim Jordan isnt even on that committee but they GOP decided they wanted to tag him in and yield their time to him. They looked around the room and thought yes, he is the man for the job. https://twitter.com/ashleyalese/status/1197171231377821697?s=12 https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1181560708808486914?s=21 Theres a tweet... for everything Cue the "I've never even met the guy" defense Lol Nunes immediately resorts to conspiracy theories. Completely ignoring the aide. This is great So they're shifting from "he didn't do it" to "okay well he did it but it wasn't illegal" in real time I love the Ive never heard of him line from trump in that meeting yesterday Ive never heard of the guy that has been all over the TV channel that I watch 16 hours a day. Raptors are -3 rn at home vs the magic Omg now they're saying okay well none of this happened on the July 25th call! Like that's the only day that crimes can't be committed Lol the trump re-election campaign is buying a super bowl spot Cant wait to see this high art https://youtu.be/qan2GxkJNFc omg Im fucking crying this is so good Positive from last night A neural network analyzed 7 years of nike spots and spit out its own version lmaoooo Melo was doubling the spot up efficiency or basically every bench guy except Ant last night Yeah is this real tho? Ive seen a bunch of fake ai spots Burger King did a whole campaign https://thenextweb.com/artificial-intelligence/2019/11/19/ai-creates-the-perfectish-nike-commercial-after-studying-7-years-of-ads/ heres the article I mean yeah the guy could be completely bullshitting Either way its hilarious Oh my god lmaooo I think it all started with that guy on twitters viral Olive Garden scripts Maybe only to me because I have to live these spots every day I feel like I just went to a nike creative meeting That fake spot wouldve cost us $7MM if WK made it lol BUZZWORDS Yeah Im calling bullshit but I could be wrong Oh its not a real ad I think thats clear Its a spoof Lol no shit https://www.google.com/amp/s/mashable.com/article/burger-king-ai-ads-beautiful-disaster.amp https://www.google.com/amp/s/mashable.com/2018/06/13/olive-garden-bot-script.amp Im just saying this aint a new gag and the last two werent actually AI lol we know dude I dont think anybody cares either way Its funny #sponsoredpost The point is that nike commercials are fucking dumb and WK sucks Yeah I dunno lol, its not as funny when its faked and been done 3 time just my opinion You must have hated The Hangover 3! I feel like the big nike brand spots have been mostly decent lately Dream crazy, kapernick etc i think Im too close to it. Dealing with the internal politics on that stuff is my least favorite part of my job. I think the overall message is good, albeit perhaps a bit hypocritical Yeah fair totally I also understand that its easier to go back to the well than it is to come up with something fresh. Thats fair. Speaking of great writing... Oh the AI thing? https://twitter.com/gettyimagesnews/status/1197202729334128642?s=12 Touche Oh dude I totally need to revise myself, i hate it because David did that (ripping off the Olive Garden guy) and got a bunch of great press And David also fires me So its personal lol Hahaha fair Wait I'm sorry Dubov is that a real photo?? Haha I think so. Its from Getty What kind of psychopath writes with a magnum 44 Sharpie? Yeah lol I think so too Holy fuck haha that is hilarious Lmao no wayyyyy\ It looks like a 9 year old wrote that I mean somebody with the IQ level of a 9 year old did I WANT NOTHING The republican counsel is so cringe worthy too lol. How is this the best lawyer they had Yeah what kind of notes are those even? He needed to remind himself to say that shit? Lol Sondland said he cant find White House record of a call he had with trump. More cover ups I mean, why is he even writing that shit down anyway? He goes off script every time. Those are notes you write and show someone under the table so they know what to say Or like behind the camera lol So republicans best defense is that the "I want no quid pro quo" statement from Trump came on September 9th. Same day he learned of the whistleblower complaint. Not following through with the crime cuz you got caught, doesn't make it not a crime https://twitter.com/adam_ballinger/status/1196969933562793984?s=12 Peep the last one Dubov Alright lines have shifted around a little bit but my bets for the day at heat -10 at home vs cavs, raptors -4 at home vs magic and rockets +2 on the road vs Denver Yesterday sucked ass but you cant really prepare for a Lillard injury an hour before the game That shits gonna happen from time to time No excuses on Phoenix tho Wow that is sick Rengel Yeah the last one is great lol https://twitter.com/ellievhall/status/1197195784422338561 https://twitter.com/sportscenter/status/1197178490472284160?s=12 SigEp Legend God there is so much free money to be had in NCAAB tonight Im still so mad about Lollards last night Lillard* Fire olshey hire hinkie trade dame to the clippers for 7 first round picks and lets do this again! ?I will tell my kids this is Gordon Sondland ?Fuck Off ASAP Rocky documented in the impeachment hearings lol Celtics Clippers is gonna be tasty tonight PG and Kawhi debut https://twitter.com/nbcnews/status/1197199763806019584?s=12 President : I want the new Popeyes chicken sandwich.

Total witch hunt! They are never going to get 2/3 in the senate not of this matters Its just about staining him for the election Not just him. All of the congressmen that dont vote to impeach or vote to remove. Their reelections are also very important. Yeah but voting against impeachment helps them get reelected imo Depends on the district theyre from But yeah, for some of them it will But those arent necessarily seats that can be flipped anyway. I dont think its relevant but who knows I suppose i think its very relevant Its all about dragging donnie, making sure nothing gets done, and getting to 2020 Hopefully the trends of all the governors losing after his multiple campaign visits will continue into the new year Virginia and Louisiana just elected Democrats in gubernatorial elections where Trumpito campaign HARD for the republican candidate Yes, what Rengel just said Isn't there a way they can do a private vote in the senate? If republicans didn't have to put their name on it I guarantee several flip Hes toxic Kentucky won a democratic gubernatorial too ?This Getty image of Melo looks silly Guys I cant believe we are here But I really want the blazers to sign Miles Plumlee God we suck https://twitter.com/chold/status/1197294165798850565?s=12 Hammer the bucks https://twitter.com/thescore/status/1197299478186905600?s=12 Hammer the hammer Ugh There goes our season Man I thought he left that shit in Portland Surprised they let him fly with it.... You can bring whatever you want on a charter bro Well then I woulda brought some drugs with me instead Gummies? Actually probably have better drugs in Miami It was Cam!!! We got him space Dion is absolved I wish I could say Ive been on a charter plane before. Bro Ive never even been in first class One time in Miami my friend got us into this swanky real estate convention in Miami Me neither Dubov And I was talking to this guy who owned a private flight charter company while in line for the bathroom and after he got out he left me a line on the soap dispenser! Said he left a little surprise for me! Except once I did put my luggage in the overhead in first class when I saw it was filling up in the back. I felt so badass Would have been better if it was a big turd That's amazing I love friendly cocaine addicts I love short lived bathroom drug bonding with strangers One time I gave a rando a bump in Chicago and he reciprocated with a couple mushroom caps Did I tell you when I shoulder tapped a guy in the bathroom in Denver? Real dumb and real awkward but turned into an amazing night Lol no I was seeing SNBRN at this club. Had an urge, tapped a guy on the shoulder as he was leaving a stall with another guy and said "you look like you're from Miami eh" (my pickup line for do you have coke). He goes are you a cop? I'm like no I got girls too bro. He says come find me with the girls. 

I find him after I get the ladies. He's at a table next to the DJ booth I'm like fuck this isn't gonna work. He sees me and the girls, waives me up. Gives us bumps and all the liquor we want the rest of the night 30 minutes later were high fiving and raging our faces off like best friends. Worked out great! Wow! Thats a wild story! Yeah he's super cool actually. He owns a dispensary in Denver. We actually met up after that too. Real cool guy Networking! Coke is the best Also, the girls thought I was the coolest guy ever that night, getting us free drugs liquor and a table haha. Could not have worked out better Thats what happens when you party with a chad Was his name Brad? ?To finish the story. He made me take a picture of him and the girls. His name is David. The end Girl on the right looks a lot like the girl in rat race ? Chad tell us the sex part now at the end of the night with the two girls at once Dont cuck me on this Im DIH Clayton's horned up Chads got us all horned up! Matty I just wanna know what you jerk it to....I can only imagine youd show me parts of the internet I never should be allowed to see. ?

Haha I didn't meet her that night but I think I looked so cool for that she agreed to keep seeing me. I'll credit ol David with an assist one this one idk the rules anymore Man this is now my third time betting against the cavs and you find yourself rooting for the ball to be in sextons hands and much as possible Oof So I guess he and Garland arent the second coming of Dame and CJ? Maybe its Garland and KPJ? Pretty sure Biden is melting onstage right now Tim Duncan + David Robinson = Duncan Robinson Someones watching the heat! I mean I dunno (regarding sexton) He has instincts and some moves But right now hes just not efficient at all And he throws up a lot of terrible shots Ok! Heat cover Raps cover Houston dont fuck up my 3/3! Speaking of inefficient What if Westbrook came off the bench I feel like Russ ball would be a good second unit Man maybe thats the next thing lol Having the best bench in the league A bunch of staticions(?) get together And realize the solution is having two good rosters OKC Westbrook and OKC harden would just switch roles lol Omg Russ goddamnit Him and Harden almost had the highlight of the year but he missed the dunk Lol I know Why cant we have a fun team like the mavs I wish we had porzingod https://twitter.com/bleacherreport/status/1197359073244545024?s=21 Ugh wow Look at the nuggets!

It's strange I don't even know how to describe it to people I usually go like once a month lol Or like every other Olympic Melo with the 3 in Giannis Face! Still 14-11 Giannis for my bet Lolol Lol the melo PR initiative is out in full force Youre damn right Because the anti-Melo campaign is just as fierce Humble gritty melo Using PPP stats and single game plus minus for a guys first game in a year Spent a year in a monesyary Momentary I understand why players think there is an agenda lol Monastery! He has been working with this French osteopath who works with LeBron Working on strengthening his legs and improving flexibility/core So steroids Learned to appreciate the game, is now a defensive playmaker Hes doing steroids is what youre saying This French dudes thing is these inflatable Wafes that you do balance exercises on to engage the entire core before playing Haha! Hes back in his prime! I dont doubt steroids are involved but I think these are very Basketball specific 17-12 Lol man you sound like Russell Wilson, Im sure if this magic workout was like the fountain of youth hed be doing it all along He looks in shape lol but Im not just gonna but into some narrative about a secret miracle training program Its not a narrative its just a guy who does stuff LeBron didnt start working with him until his last year with the Cavs So what are you saying lol melo is back to form? Im saying hes in better shape Oh yeah Well thats for sure And hes done specific workouts to be in better basketball shape Yeah I think every player in the league sans early aughts Eddie curry has done specific workouts to be in better basketball shape Yeah dude but shit changes The stuff that is the cutting edge now wasnt the cutting edge when he was coming in A lot of guys dont know how to make the change Time will tell! Just saying health gurus are a dime a dozen (ask Tom Brady) and this is all coming from Melos camp Yeah I mean hes been very vague I looked into the guy who he was working with myself Im sure its a story they are saving until he actually plays well Lol I dunno man why youre being defensive, I like melo lol, but you cant deny theres been a barrage of fairly cliche articles about humbling himself and getting back in the gym and learning to be a leader etc etc Its just something that happens when players make a comeback Yeah absolutely but athletes are walking cliches Yeah! Or at least, they more or less have to be Checks gotta cash lol Its their nature ?Don't forget about Oliver Miller space He was all natural. No workouts needed Yeah you can tell how different it is by how few fats we have in the league Is Skal the secret sauce?! ? RIP Fats hehehe Getting buckets, rebounding, defending Giannis! They actually have Tolliver on Giannis and Melo on Lopez lol Shows how much terry trusts Moses brown I think skal was switched on him But he shut him down! Wed be down 20 without Skal lmao. He hit 2 3s and a midrange jumper SKAL IS GETTING BUCKETS YOU CANNOT STOP HIM Wes just pumpfaked Melo back into his Nuggets days Tolliver is getting bitched so hard Honestly if we had Zach Melo would be perfect lol These national TV announcers r driving me nuts Chris Webber is awful Here are all the ways that the blazers are bad , let us list them Here is a graphic showing the blazers at the bottom of the west standings aptly titled "bottom of the west" I wish I could downvote commercials so I didnt have to see that stupid fucking Mountain Dew migos ad Haha I was just thinking that I feel like it's been going for 3 seasons Bro its honestly something I wish I could discuss with an occupational therapist I can never ever hear that song Without going into a spiral Tolliver is the Giannis stopper !! Only positive I can think of is at least anfernee and nassir r getting run This game is way closer than I thought it would be Still a lotta time I guess Yeah I mean games where we're up 4-5 going into the fourth we've been losing by 8-12 so we're trending to lose by around 20-25 God nassir is a silver lining Hes so good already Blazers just need to use nugenix lol this game is a hell of a ride when youve got bucks -12 Lol Classic matchup Nail biter! Oh shit Clint Eastwood made a movie about Richard jewel?? Carmelo up 46-36 after POURING IN 23 minutes Sure lets just let planet pat have open lanes to the bucket Oh God they did the graphic FML The ref looks like Corey booker You know what feels good? When you dont make any basketball bets and then look through the scores and realize everything you thought about wouldve lost. Not losing money feels way better than losing money. Pat is going down with patty mills and will Barton as guys we developed then promptly got rid of so other teams could enjoy the fruits of our labor Don't forget the original Jermaine O'Neal Lol hes averaging 4.5 ppl relax Ppg* He's got 3 dunks ! Obligatory hackneyed giannis Greek god graphic Need an ad where it's him atop mount Olympus but it's mountain dew Hey 7 points 4 boards 2 assists last season! On a 60 win team He's no Donte Robinson but still legit Bro it was 6.9 Way nicer! Lets go! +13.5 in range! I love how Melo yells "get the fuck out of here!" On his boards Very alpha We need that energy Hezonja is very beta Ughhhh Suck a cock tease 48-46 Giannis What are these numbers Brock Dylan blazers +1800! It's a lock!

Gonna drink one more dark winter ale and knock myself out Camping World Bowl? Famous Idaho Potato Bowl? Gaylord Hotels Music City Bowl Presented by Bridgestone BAD BOY MOWERS GASPARILLA BOWL. December 23rd 2019 Mark deja vu To Stanford at home Kraft cheese bowl here we come! Highlight of college was chad and I screaming mid level bowl games as we walked home Lady in front of us has a complete breakdown and screams shut the fuck up at us on the Austen bridge Shoulder to shoulder with angry Eugene locals in their 40's Then were stuck shoulder to shoulder next to her for the next 5 minutes! We kept yelling well this isnt awkward!!! at her We were just being real! Too real apparently College was a blast It aint over baby Also FYI rengel is about to get kicked out Hell yeah and hes gone A worthy sacrifice Beautiful He also hit a girl in the face. Big fun Just like the Blazers and Heat Video? Sacrificed so we can all win The gods demand a blood tribute Welp The fans took a pic of him flipping them off Were a basketball school Both genders Lmaooooo Wow Pac12 after dark Time to plan out the womens final 4 trip NOLA 2020 Ive always loved Travis dye He still owes us a fumble for this game My contribution... ? He gone https://share.icloud.com/photos/0ynCkcchc3vUTaDE5Vca1dGIQ Highlight of the game #TrumpsAmerica Wow. Sports are hard these days boys. Not a great day of sports Bad sports Gambling account went from 499 for the week to 60 Woof Yeah lol just no luck lol I took the under in the Ortiz wilder fight hoping a baptism by fire can wash away this ducks loss Only thing Ill say is that maybe thisll drive the heat hornets line down Gamblers optimism! ? Who wants to lose some money today!!!! Mark are we back on? Completely forgot! Next week :( Keeping it simple. Raiders ravens lions Is Stanford gonna play? Nah Driskel Thats why theyre not 14 point favorites Purely fading the skins Kinda regretting my raiders pick Raiders are one of the hottest teams in the league! Going for 4 straight Yeah man I hammered the raiders hard stop that shit! Yah early kick across the country jets are playing well again. But yah raiders should win Jesus Raiders Yah why did I do that Need the lions to end this Gruden Mastermind If only they had Mack Thank you Haskins They just did a Jameis Winston Billy Jean King segment Barely made it through the Mexico - USA border but we did ! Hawks d unbelievable Low key got real sketch for a minute, got in the wrong Lane and had to back up lol Random Mexican guys telling us to roll down our windows and that the border officers are their friends. Backed up like 500 yards and they moved a gate so we could use the fast pass we had paid for. Could have been like a 3 hour border wait cancel. Rooting for the Seahawks is quite a rollercoaster isnt it I mean were 9-2? Its been mostly ups! Especially when we beat the fraud ass niners at home! Niners -3 lock of the century Carolina-Saints been a classic Anyone believe in that mustache cuck Aaron Rodgers??? Was just looking at standings, it's crazy, niners are +140 point differential on the year, Pat's are +179, Ravens +145, Seahawks are +29 Seafrauds* Yah except russ is a cheat code at clutch Yeah I dunno I think theyre turning the corner rn tbh They also havent lost in the nfc west Today should have been more dominant, we blew it on two open tds Apparently one of the other cars in our caravan tried to do the same backup move and got hit by a car and extorted for $800 lol Just sprinkled some powder on my Hamilton tiger cats to win the coveted Grey Cup TiCats -4 https://twitter.com/ALBY_LAD/status/1145766054557364225?s=20 ?Jesus Im V tired of losing bets because coaches dont understand the difference between the numbers 3 and 7 Niners -3 was straight up disrespectful Packers are trash https://twitter.com/So_Money_Sports/status/1198832500044259328 Are the blazers going to beat the bulls? No God its depressing that youre probably right Zach LaVine is big mad at jim Boylen. Hes scorched earth Zach LaVine right now Theyre in prove it mode for me especially against bad teams I have no trust in them smh Are we team #FadeBlazers Im not sure if Im comfortable with the blood money Not there yet But getting close Nah I wont do it Lakers -5 vs Spurs? Gunde is everyone playing tonight? For the Lakers? Yeah basically everyone except Avery Bradley Theyve been kinda lazy on defense last few tho Might let spurs hang around I bet ravens -3.5 BKN @ Cavs is PK Yea is Kyrie not playing? Joe Nope Shoulder He might need surgery I might take a shot at those pesky cavs John Belien! The nets have been winning a lot of games without Kyrie Against shitty teams Theyre off a back to back Celtics revenge game tonight Lotta sharp money on Philly Oh those fuckers took UCLA ML off the board as I was hitting submit. PK now. ?? So midnight December 15th is whiteside gone or? Something has to change And I dont want it to be Stotts So yes I really wanted whiteside to workout It just doesnt Yeah whiteside is done IMO. It clearly isn't working Stotts has earned the right to ride the waves Gundy u send the personal birthday text yet ? You already know ? We need this positive energy Wowoowowow Stotts knows hes done if hes replying to birthday texts Lmaooo Cam wants the word inside giphy over this baby Yoda controversy I was on that call Long story short we were on the phone with Disney+ walking them through our products and they saw a bunch of baby Yoda gifs and were like, why are these on here? We didnt put them up. Then my AE panicked and ran to our partnerships team and made them have the partner take them down. Apparently the guy who made them was PISSED and is starting all kinds of trouble and Disney is denying the whole thing because they never technically asked for them to be taken down. ? Wow thats wild ? So from what I gather mandalorian is kinda the only reason to have Disney+? Like unless I have kids Disney originals are on there Brink Cool Runnings All the old throwbacks Yeah those are classic ....But not worth a sub service If youre running a daycare service Id say its a must tho I think its free for a year if you have Verizon? Or maybe thats only for new Verizon customers. But Im assuming it has Remember the Titans and if that is in fact the case it is worth infinite money I will probably do it for the holidays and then cancel after a month lol I would say the real value is probably in the bundle with ESPN+ and Hulu Yeah I get Hulu for free through spotify so Im not gonna do that most likely Cause dont you have to get Hulu plus? Yeah I get Hulu for free also Never use it Im a big fan of Always sunny and pass out Which is what I use it for Also every guy fieri show on demand I have recording set up on YouTube TV for DDD. Endless episodes. Hulu is solid and will get better once Fox has their content on there YouTube tv, no PAC is my only reason for not ditching sling I just moved into a different spot on Friday and I think Ive convinced my buddy to cancel Comcast and keep YTTV We use weak spell to illegally stream random games but I dont think it has NCAAB Well Dayton showed up to hit the over but Georgia did not. ?Casual 10 inches in Denver tonight Quit talking about your dick Chad Find yourself on the map! I'm more of a Frisco Lexington Steele in town ? Kremmling here This chat is now only for people with 23 inch dongs How about 23mm? More like Castle Cock! TIL all the cities around Denver sound like names for premium dildos ?Football Im on ravens -3.5 anyone want rams? Gross Melo is eating So is Lamar Jackson When Zach and Nurk are back, Mel00 will be the 60% from corner 3 answer weve been looking for MELO DA GAWD BULLY BALL Just let Melo thrive in his Quinten Richardson stage of his career Brooklyn +2 ?? Opted for GT ML instead of +1.5. They lost by 1 in OT. Always take the points! Arkansas is a fraud! The ML was the right side!!! Man Baltimore is scary Lamar Jackson doesnt give a fuck Can't believe I picked him up on the waiver wire week 2 in one of my leagues Are the blazers gonna find a way to blow this Lol what chas Chad ?My dumbass friend cut him for Big Ben week 1 lol The fuck Your friend needs help Either that or hes trolling on a level even higher than Dylan and the Atlanta Cocks And thats another heat cover -10.5 I think they might be undefeated ats at home this year Melo with 25 and 8 Cherish this moment Weekend sports bad Weekday sports good Melo gonna make the all star team you heard it here first Im listening to the Power theme song on repeats Lala is behind the blazers bench We are the team of the culture Yeah especially your social media team I hate to admit this because I hate Bruce Pearl so much, but I love this auburn team Only twitter cares about that The crowd in Chicago is chanting for Melo! https://twitter.com/chold/status/1199161021170159617?s=12 Im gonna let you have this moment Its Melos team now *league Talking about the Blazers social media team when we win is like when USC students tried to shit talk me about class sizes when the Ducks kicked their ass at the coliseum I appreciate you letting us have this but you can do better than the social team https://www.instagram.com/p/B5TSF4EFOLV/?igshid=18lxvvvmwcunc Team mom Dude Im not a bulls fan and you beat the bulls What are you talking about lol You just got all smart about people loving Melo! You get unimpeachable shit talk rights once you beat the bulls? Im talking about Melo! People love him! And he balled out No lol I made a joke when you said the blazers were the team of the culture Because of Melo! It had nothing to do with melo and it was a joke Not a nuanced complaint about the blazers social media situation Right but the blazers being the team of the culture hinges on Melo Im also drunk Meanwhile Ian, this is the blackest blazer squad maybe ever right now Not a good look space Brock... the 05 blazers had Ruben Patterson, Travis Outlaw, Darius Miles, Zach Randolph, Sebastian Telfair, and Martell Webster... The vendors are arguing with the fans, Rams stadium energy is poor. Bro Im not trying to fight rn I need Lakers -5 and I dont want any bad karma We havent seen culture since they broke up that team Culture is not the culture JaVale playing in the 4th is not good Two different things For the cover This could be a 3/3 Heat/ravens/lakers Oh shit how much? 150 on each so 450 total I took a huge two nights in a row Huge L* Im about to see the heat 3 times in a row LeBron baby Closing time Miami on Friday Brooklyn on Sunday MSG on tues Oh wow Thats awesome https://twitter.com/chold/status/1199168426046033920?s=12 Melo moved to 18th on the Nba scoring list tonight ? These warriors broadcasters are morons Wooohoooo Thats a cover! If he plays next season too he could move into the top 10 ever If he stays on the team he will pass KG by seasons end #HoneyNutCheerios Seriously who are these dipshits for the warriors. Its bad enough their team sucks but their fans also have to listen to this shit? All Im saying is I dont care what the line is Heat covering against warriors in Miami on Friday Embiid with a goose egg in 32 minutes? That's impressive Sixers only try half the time Does that count as a game played? I don't think so. He wasn't anywhere to be found tonight Gundy your lebron take is looking better and better by the day. 14 assists tonight I wish I had bet on it lmao Or that Id been allowed to Whats funny is theyre the worst pick and roll team in the league Theyre a total 90s team The AD trade also seems like a win win all the way around. Don't see that often Heat 2 seed? ? Infinity We needed a true weirdo for this blazers to hit their final form We needed Melo 6-12 here we go Man I am getting obliterated today Is this their final form? Well no but when Nurk and Collins are back Melo off the bench Champions https://twitter.com/kcjhoop/status/1199026663188844544?s=21 Suck on that space Terry clocks in everyday I loled truthfully https://trillblazin.net/ Do not share this outside of the superliga Highkin already blew up ur spot I was just trying to make sure they didnt sell out if anybody wanted stuff I tried to buy on my phone but making purchases on mobile is a nightmare I had to log on too Hopefully some r left by the time I get home Any blazers home games Wednesday to Sunday? Trying to get a peanut butter killer burger https://twitter.com/aaron_torres/status/1199185665675513856?s=21 Bill is in mid-season form right now. He just said I know some people that will happily bury you alive. And taken out of context that is absolutely terrifying. There is a guy that plays for BYU that looks like he works at the hardware store and he knows which product will get any stain out. Like ANY stain. Blood. Semen. Anything. You guys. I cant believe I didnt see this with Melo before. ? Also Friday against Chicago is a game 40 dollar get in price right now Wait did dubov miss who led the team in scoring tonight??? The man he's been advocating for since day 1 We're all pitching in to get dubov a Melo Jersey for Christmas Thats fine as long as it says Melo is a bum on the back https://twitter.com/ayoarati/status/1199169475007762434?s=12 Is Kawhi playing tonight? Clippers -2.5 Against Dallas Anybody else trying to do the #PapaJohnChallenge? I think I can eat 40 pizzas in 30 days I thought that was something else that got him fired lololol Mark I assume Kawhi is but you never know with him its not a back to back so probably he does play ? Oh shit it IS a back to back At Dallas So he plays tonight not tomorrow? My Son is gonna absolutely cook tonight. Dont love it I like Denver -9.5 at home tbh Gonna be handing out Slovenian dishes to everybody Good money to made in bad teams getting crushed I like the over at 227 in the nugs wiz game Do the nugs play lockdown d? Or do they score a lot I dunno denver is a lot slower this year Denver is so confusing. They keep stacking wins but the narrative is how theyre not playing that well Denver is 25th in ppg They have been at home a lot Im not doing other bets this week than hammering GS at Miami on Friday And hopefully they get a good line against the nets https://www.theroot.com/pete-buttigieg-is-a-lying-mf-1840038708 The actor that plays Kendal Roy should be him in a biopic someday Denver defense is underrated There's also gonna be nobody at the game tonight. I can't even open my front door ?? Say, you look like youre from Colorado if you know what I mean..... They dont make biopics about people forgotten in history Totally fair - just thought the thumbnail looked like him and never put 2 and 2 together Speaking of the Roy family, watched home alone the other day and its so weird seeing Roman Roy as a child lol Kendall Roy as Mayor Pete delivering a rap about how hes a friend of the minorities ? Gonna tell my kids this was Quin Snyder My favorite Greek team brought back the god ? ? I made a woof. I am proud of this. Im loving Bills +6.5 @ Dallas on Turkey day Im hoping cowboy nation pushes it to 7 https://twitter.com/jon_bois/status/1199372404784615426?s=20 ?Lexington Steele ain't got shit on this! Line dropping to 1.5 in the clips game, no Kawhi? Not seeing it yet Only need the blazers to go 41-23 to hit that over So Ashleys parents own a promotional products company (basically your companys logo on anything you can think of) and Im at their office right now. I feel like Im living in a real-life episode of The Office. Met the warehouse folks, the accounting and sales departments, reception. Have yet to identify the Dwight of the bunch though Bahahaha Thats hilarious Feel like you can take OSU +21 and not even feel bad about it Yeah man that game is gonna be close Can anyone explain why anyone would want an in season nba tournament??? What a waste of time Idk it makes my brain hurt Good way to lose even more fans I think it gives casuals a reason to watch We do not need exhibition sports period Its going to be part of the regule season schedule Regular Just some games in October and November will be play-in type games What Theyre not stopping the season To do the tournament Teams will play divisional games to determine who represents the division, basically a form of group play thats already baked into the schedule Then its whoever wins the divisions + the two best teams in an 8-team single-elimination Eww no Idk an NBA version of the elite 8 sounds fun to me Meaningless basketball The contenders already make the playoffs based on The games they play Yea I dont get what the incentive here is besides money for the organizations and players Iike the champs league and Fa cup etc have desire because of their history The whole thing is for people like you Houman People that endlessly complain the regular season means nothing This makes it even more meaningless tho How? What do you get for winning? A trophy, some money? Thats value means nothing Money, glory, winning a competition Its value * Winning an nba championship means more. Their trying to make it like Europe but what they forgot is that the EPL is one division in English football. So the FA cup is like a country cup where you have all leagues competing. The nba doesnt have that Nobody says that a championship isnt still the ultimate goal Sounds dumb to me. I'm with hoomie for once Just re-do playoff seeding so it's 1-16 and start there Also, this will never ever change, but 7 game series are a big issue IMO. That's why the parity is so bad 5 game series would allow for more upsets / teams getting hot 53% of teams make playoffs. Laughable to suggest there needs to be another path to making it But a single elimination tourney is like the exact opposite of a7 game series! In the middle of the season? And it thought it was just for money? Doesn't fix it Yea but whats the value of the tourney Yah but the prize of the tourney is the exact same playoff spot youd get anyway Whats the value of any sport we watch? Entertainment I wanna see a team like the Heat that gets hot towards the end of the year and runs thru the playoffs to upset the favorites The title Like the NFL Can't happen with 7 game series This title means nothing Entertainment need suspense And meaning Nobody is gonna hang a "mid season tourney champs" banner in their arena I agree with chad 5 game series and with Brock. Decrease the slots to 12 total. But we all know that will never happen because thats less games Oh man the hornets lost their tournament game last night. Now they really need to win their other gameS Okay That's another good point. Over half the league shouldn't make the playoffs 12 teams is better Yah were stuck w that tho like Houman said Theres no way the owners or players are going to agree to a 70 game or 66 games or 5 game first round or basically anything that lowers the amount of revenue This tourney adds some excitement in a situation where you cant make a major major change They chance a team wins this tourney who wasnt going to make playoffs already is 0% $50 on clips -1.5 only god can judge me FIRE MOURINHO That should make it an even more dope accomplishment if you win the double And then that could become its own thing https://www.latimes.com/sports/clippers/story/2019-11-25/luka-doncic-dallas-mavericks-head-of-the-snake-kawhi-leonard-paul-george-clippers Take the under on Luka tonight Never! ?Im offering even money on anyone that wants the over on Luka tonight Im getting into Top Boy next time you see me Im gonna be speaking purely British slang This Mavs court is horrendous It looks like a Nickelodeon set Somebody is about to get slimed ?

Should I drive up to Houston? Where are you? Lake Jackson, TX 45ish minutes directly south of Houston How can u pass up a rare chance to yell at Meyers in person? Remember me?! Unblock me on Twitter, coward! Lost a couple tough ones, but overall 11-5 today in NCAAB. 12-5 if Clemson can close this out. ?

 ? First ever sourdough stuffing Gundy I been following on the socials. I need this recipe Also Ive been corrected a dozen times already for calling it stuffing. Apparently its dressing round these parts. Dubov why are you in Texas again? Is that where your girl is from?

We got some Texas Tech, Baylor, and A&M Just gonna remind them how sick Oregons uniforms are Hell yeah Dubov its pretty straight forward, probably the toughest thing is toasting/slicing a whole loaf of bread But its the only way to get premium stuffing IMO I could be wrong but I think every one of those teams is under lmao A&M is close lol I think so Brock Stuffing is inside the turkey, dressing is outside Its that simple Oh well shit That makes too much sense So I guess what I made is dressing cause we got a turkey from Elephants this year lol https://www.instagram.com/p/B5YooTZFGBq/?igshid=1wmptu6f0zffg This is hilarious. Nobody wore big baller brand, but people are gonna buy branded gear for the brother not even in the league?

For who? I mean Both teams? Yeah lol Ah the classic dual revenge game I mean I just think the takeaway here is AD doesnt wanna get embarrassed Lol lakers are disappointing for now but AD gonna drop 60 tonight This man is aggrieved! So weird theyre losing lol I am bad at nba teasers Seton Hall just not missing tonight lol This is a good game for us to have Oregon +525 rn I dont think they pull this one out Seton Hall having their best shooting game of the year theyll have tonight Ducks always pull out Theyve got a few guys whove hit threes that legit dont shoot them lol This timeout will determine game Seton Hall also returned 11 guys Theyre really good He doesnt touch rim Myles Powell is a grown ass man Blazers need to draft him The bucket is the size of the Atlantis wade pool rn Myles Powell is one of the few college players I know and I like that hes a dog Saw some Big East tourney last year with him I believe Hes gonna pull the whole Atlantis pool later The fact that a ducks defender hasnt been hugging him since the tip tells me oregon watched zero film I mean Oregon plays a zone They arent going to really divert from that Yeah thats dumb If they did their research they would know that isnt gonna work I liked what they did early, attacking the rim, but this got out of hand because they have really not missed from outside. Bout to be the Mathis show Yeah they just arent missing It wont matter what we do if they dont miss from 3 Ya after that last one especially Juiston has the brokest shot lol Hes been killing every other game tho Pritchard closes out like he went to west Linn I am on an Alaska flight if I get Gogo inflight you think Ill have enough internet to stream on league pass ? no Okay I wont get it , Ill rely on u guys for cool updates with topical pop culture references Thank u in advance ?? score check ?? I cant help but notice Oregon has missed eight free throws Its 60-50 Matt 10 left Oregon is in the bonus. Will it matter? Ducks or blazers ? Ducks I know you care more about this than Blazers Gotcha Blazers game doesnt officially start until ducks win But its 63-50 Zers at half Its pretty crazy u guys shape my reality right now. Oregon could lose and you could lie and tell me they won and Id feel the genuine excitement of victory until I landed Thats a lot of power Sounds like the idea kinda turns you on Wait til you land and see what trump did Trump has been impeached The crowd when Melo touches it is like a playoff game lol Every touch the crowd starts buzzing Im all horned up for information 2 bank threes for Powell damn We do not shoot free throws well Not at all Score ? 72-59 blazers

The topic of conversation centered on movies and podcasts, two things I am well versed in. That is surprising Yeah Im thankful Maxing our on this raptors -3 at magic ? Magic projected lineup Can you imagine owning magic season tix Find me a better evening in Orlando and Ill agree with this Dont sleep on Wes Iwundu ?? I am a big fan of Disneyworld so a drunken night at Epcot May edge out a magic game for me personally. Apparently theres a cool metal scene in Orlando If thats your thing Since its family photo time heres my girlfriends grandpa gifting a young Oscar de la Hoya an avocado ? He looks stunned! Hahaha Lol all I can tell you is he is 96 He is here He has not said one word all evening And hes been sitting in a chair drinking rum out of a coffee cup watching hbo boxing replays for 5 hours He smiles every now and then Is that pauly shore ? Oh boy I am feeling extra greedy tonight. Just made some fried turkey sliders, might dabble on some more college hoops Just bragged about living with world renowned poker player/millionaire James Romero for about the millionth time Wonder if he ever thinks about me! Are you a Costa Rican prostitute? Lol space that was a great summer Me you cam and the poker champ himself Lol so many memories that summer Guy smashing car You and cam getting punched Party where tweaked showed up and me and Lindsey had to call cops House getting robbed The list goes on Costco trips I cooked chad cleaned cam j did nothing Lache seastrunk honorary roomie Hahaha holy shit I forgot about all those stories Remember 4th of July when kenjon barner was shooting Roman candles outside our house and someone pulled the stop sign outta the ground Littles convenience store didn't ID. Andre champagne for days 4 lache seastrunk memories 

1. When he told you he had a vision from god he was gonna score in the national championship and dunked on Dwyane Wade
2. Him screaming at David Wendt for not backing you up in a fight David wasnt involved in if I was there, n**** would have been hitting the floor 
3. Him overpaying a guy on Craigslist for a tv for no reason 
4. The first time I met him, he just walked in without knocking while I was cooking chicken in a pan and said fried chicken? Thats whats up! And went upstairs. What was your nickname in high school Lache? Uhh superstar, all star, da god... Was that the same summer that guy evaded the cops in the alley outside spe and actually got away ? And they got his bong ?? I remember chad and Ryan bailey chucking bottles off the balcony in front of me and Lindsay and me acting tough threatening Ryan lol (would dropped him, one punch!) 2011 Ian Holmes was def in a good position to fight an Olympic athlete Hahahaha holy shit that's an amazing memory. Those lache stories are great Also by threatening I mean shrugging my shoulders and saying whats up? Also the tv story, I went with him to pick it up. It was one of those old 55 inch TVs with the fucking box attached to the back. He had a 2 door mustang. It wouldn't even get close to fitting in the door I was like how did you think this was even remotely possible? ?One of these lol I think the guy reported the car stolen and it worked https://twitter.com/bubbaprog/status/1200262405969862656?s=12 lmaaaaoooo Im dead The saints better cover Does Matt Ryan not realize he cant hold onto very long... Am I missing something with that raptor/heat game. The line is only -3.5 Yeah youre missing my advice 5 hours earlier when it was -3, pay attention ? No respect! Ibaka out tho I bought it down to -3 Im up $300 after turkey day football Nice mark I think its a winner Magic dragging out some dudes Heat -11.5 at home vs warriors is nice too Tho jimmy might be out The line will prob move either way when that news drops Willing to bet he plays tho Cole Anthony blocking Juiston at rim damn So heres the thing about Cole Anthony The more I look at him the more I think he doesnt look anything like Greg In fact, he looks a lot like Brian Grant. And the thing about Brian Grant Oh shit Is that he was Greg Anthonys teammate around the time Cole was conceived. Think about it. Could we have a Ronan Farrow/Frank Sinatra situation???? With Greg Anthony as woody Allen Did you see Cole Anthonys block in the first half? Very Brian Grant-like... ?????? Maybe this is why the Jail Blazers movie hasnt gotten made Added another $50 to the raptors Steve Kerr says hi Circus in Atlantis right now Near same situation here as final four if UNC misses free throw ?Lol Dang how is Michigan unranked Theyre spanking Gonzaga Theyll be ranked after this week, possibly unranked to top 15 lol Theyll be top 5 Theyre unranked because of Juwan Howard. Never coached a game in his life before getting hired. Ducks will have a big game there in 2 weeks with Dante Simpson vs Pritchard is gonna be so fun to watch Half of elite 8 might be the teams in Atlantis Very possible. Obviously it sucks to lose but gotta like how the ducks played - free throws. Getting smoked down low will change with Dante If Oregon boxed and out and hit free throws we would be undefeated But the improvement overall even from earlier in the month is tremendous We gotta decide who our go to guy is at the end of the game. Dana went a couple different ways and hes probably just feeling it out Duarte can take over when ready I hope so I would rather Pritchard create For sure but I like having options haha Duarte is the next Scottie pippen lol ? McMenamins on 23rd is dope The restaurant or the bottle shop? Both, but at the restaurant now Bottle shop has cheap growler fills on Mondays its awesome Its vice night bitches! ? Attending with any lesbians ? Ian whats the price on a Meyers Jersey? We dont sell to haters Thats not heat culture ? Catch Me If You Can is a top 5 Christmas movie.

Yes Only cause they both went to Michigan state Anybody who watched them knew it was bullshit Unfair for Denzel Digging this Whiteside carter jr matchup God lol I think the heat are like 8-1 ATS at home Lol Whiteside had 4-6-6 blocks Would love to see Hassan end with more blocks than points Lmao Skal ??

Yeah I considered the kings but philly is weird bc they can be a top 3 team or like get blown out by the hawks Kings are sneaky competitive too Im taking the night off lol Kings have been rolling lately. Buddy and Richaun have been eating. Entire bulls team at the eS We have to get rid of arroyo after the season Or before, I wouldnt complain Heat -3 @ nets tomorrow No Kyrie The nets are actually frisky But heat are 14-3 ats rn https://twitter.com/LivPosting/status/1200795717088038912 Roll Tide Smokin big doinks! ?

Not gonna go any bragging tho until after tomorrow I also got burned by the kings twice Fool we twice! Harden has almost as many points as the hawks rn This is absurd Fool me three times, well youre not gonna fool me again ? Also I think good teams kicking the shot out of bad teams at home is the move this year And hes shooting 66.6% Ive been hammering some -11.5s etc this year They had 127 at the end of the third lol This. Is. Nuts. So lets be honest. Do we honestly think we can beat Utah next week? 100%! Not really but it looks like we got a good shot at making rose bowl win or lose Im totes down for a rose bowl. https://www.instagram.com/p/B5h_EEdg1q8/?igshid=1831lwezsq9nz Even our ex players are getting injured Im just gonna bet on the heat I think But given yet another magic injury Warriors +8.5 at magic Potential good bet The magic have like 6 healthy bodies Man that sucks about Aminu Houman and I will be binge drinking at 1 and observing the Brooklyn Nets take on the red hot Miami Heat!

Huge if true https://twitter.com/MagicJohnson/status/1201280950719545344 *deletes score app, install Magic Johnson app* ? Alright non NFL guy here. Did Garrett finally get canned? Nope. Not yet Yeah thats what I thought cause I couldnt find anything online. Had a feeling that would be happening soon though. I hope they flex 49ers saints next weekend to Sunday night Some kid from Beaverton broke the ncaa record in assists tonight And had zero points lol ? 24 assists, zero points? Rondo is impressed ?@Dubov I know you were worried about my ACC slate Went 29-25 overall tho :( ?? Refs get it wrong again lol Whats score of pats game ? 14-3 houston Dang , thanks! Refs 100% going to fuck this up Hey nice call I just dropped the "per my previous email" line on a co worker who was being a dick and it never felt so good lol Hawks ravens gonna be a dope super bowl Pumped Bird Up Holy fuck Chris Peterson steps down That was unexpected WTF Jimmy Lake is such a douche lmao Wtf Why would he do that I wonder if it has to do with his kids health Must want to be done Take a break Idk https://twitter.com/chrisbhaynes/status/1201592315271360513?s=21 Suck on that Dubov!! ? I like how they format them like scientific journals Incredible news! Olshey GM of the year! Bro I could not care less He could win finals mvp and I still wouldnt enjoy watching his brand of basketball lol Hoodies are disrepspextful to the legacy of Our Game James Romero is behind the button on Erik Seidel ! ?????? Hahaha so dubov dislikes melo more than he likes the blazers Im all in on Seahawks tonight Dehaan you want some Vikings action? Dehaan Hates the Vikings and has less belief in them than anyone I know Dehaan has Kirk cousins tattooed on him like Roger Stone and Nixon Im the biggest Vikings fan in this chat Yah but it covered up the case keenum one that was a teddy cover Chris Petersen taking an advisory role with the school lol thats an individual award Ian it has nothing to do with the blazers Haha yeah but if melo plays well enough to become finals mvp, hes presumably greatly helped the blazers totally, but his contributions (or lack thereof) to his previous teams have nothing to do with my dislike for his style of play. The entire reason I dont like Melo is because I do not like watching his style of basketball. so unless he completely changes the way he plays, Ill continue to get a sick feeling when I watch him BS and House think towns is better than Lillard Boy how the mighty have fallen Towns is having a crazy year rn tho Tru I don't think that's an indictment of Lillard necessarily Towns is a beast Towns 10th ranked player. Lillard 11th then Embiid then Jimmy then booker Wow that's high for booker Who would you have ahead of booker Im listening to the pod RN Idk who all is in their top 10. But Siakam, Luka, Beal and Kyrie for sure. maybe Mitchell and Simmons too I thought BS hated Booker Siakam is 9 Luka is 5 I think Kyrie and Beal after embiid I fucked up I think. So Jimmy is 14 and booker is 15 then they stopped. So basically Mitchell and Simmons should be 15 then 16 and booker 17? 11-20 is really hard to rank Would you guys rather take Seahawks -2.5 at -122 or ML at -145 Ah gotcha. Yeah 11-20 is pretty interchangeable. I would say Booker is for sure top 25. 15-20 I could see an argument At that vig probably ml That said Im confident hawks win so Im on the points Thats sorta what Im thinking Oh man its up to -150 now Kings -5 at home vs bulls Kings -5 and suns -5 Suns have been going down hill, I stayed away but I like your bet Brock tell me the hawks are gonna win by 17 I have a no hawks rule either on or against Think im like 1-21 ATS picking their games I have no compass So, hawks by 30? I love it I feel like it will be very close game 30 points is close in tennis So theres that https://twitter.com/covers_vegas/status/1201664408339939328?s=21 https://twitter.com/knguyen/status/1201681828421259267 https://twitter.com/guyfieri/status/1201622881559556098?s=21 Suns cover by .5, never in doubt! That was a great game Kelly Oubre aka Wave Papi defensive takeover late I smell a push lol If you git hawks -3 What if the heat end up with Blake griffin Slot him in Meyers spot Positional downgrade imo Pistons get justice Winslow Meyers and a pick What if Meyers other dog dies Guys heres an interesting one if you can stomach betting the cavs The pistons are -2.5 tomorrow at Cleveland They dont have a home win since the season opener In that time frame theyve lost to the bulls twice The hornets and the wizards So Im saying Cleveland moneyline Ill take Detroit -2.5 for 50 If you want to put that boo boo logic to the test Ok! Some guy won 100k on the over in this game. Thats insane. I tailed it for $50 Im 2/2 on these big money totals.

Rule of thumb, if some jackass is putting the average income of two American households on an over, Im hitting it Man lol I had a huge week lat week 880! But I had it up to 1450 Whatd you finish at Jesus And then the patriots fucked me I took the ?? for $300 Im 3 weeks in and Im +868, -404, +880 Im just not touching any of this money Until I decide Im done lol Ducks +6.5 and +200 ML we gonna win? Im officially done making big bets on football I barely watch football and never read about it Right right, but ducks Its fun tho! Lakers Nuggets tomorrow Last week I was at 1450 Heat pushed Lets go Lakers +2 Gimme the Lake show Who wins that game Yea I like lakers Had 500 on it so I revert the pats :( Betting on lebron is fun Bron and AD gonna make Jokic look extra fat while making Barton and Murray extra small Yeah I dunno the lakers or weird Whats the heat line tomorrow Sometimes lebron is so passive I dont think its out yet Im prob gonna pass They said yesterday their goal is to never lose 2 in a row Im gonna hit heat @ Wiz on Friday and then nail bulls at heat on Friday And the Nuggets are No. 2 Easy time for a statement Heat at home against terrible teams Is just like going to the atm If I was betting right now I would bet Lakers tomorrow ML Did u guys read up on the cardinals guy who was betting on nfl games ? He had a 3 team parlay with cards losing as part of it lol Briefly had them losing in a parlay right? Yes fucking amazing Caesars ratted him out Im not dissing you Gundy at all but Ive officially decided to remove things like statement and theyve got incentive bc of this grudge from my betting process Lakers are maybe the best team in basketball but not ATS Lebron has been in the league how long 14 years? But hey, everybodys got their method! Ive bet on the Lakers a lot Wowowow hawks I might hit lakers just because theyre the better team and the spread is so low But tomorrow is a value on lakes IMO Yeah Thats more what I meant but I love a narrative I might hit them I gotta look into it Yea I feel lakers when rested should be favored always No I know lol Tho I was so mad at myself about lakers pelicans I was just like Ad is gonna show up fired up And he did!

Duncan Robinson and Meyers Leonard look like long lost cousins Are lineups out for game ? Blazers? Kawhi and PG are playing Yes Gary Trent is healthy I think lineups are due 45 before so in about 10 minutes Lakers up 8 so I live bet lakers -3.5 Gary Trent out btw Everyone else good to go What do you make of the blazers Being as objective as you can I would take the points tonight Like its not totally implausible that it just takes them a bit to gel with these new guys And they right the ship I think they can get the 6 seed Its just gonna be too much for them to get to the top half with how they started Thats probably their ceiling I mean weve played well but also we played the bulls and the thunder Feels like Hassan is more engaged with Melo around ? So it begins Tune in Miami 9 secs left for heat ball Been tuned in The east is back! Jimothy! Come on ? I guessing this is directed at Ian just betting the heat every night ??? Not seeing Melo yet He doesnt warm up its weird He's only got so many miles left. Gotta conserve energy Need this OT against This double headed luka lebron dragon Omg jimmy!

Lakers starting to fade Double OT in the spurs game I know lol come on harden Bust this open Heat won by 11 in ot Still alive Lakers Nuggets a 3 point game Hezonja not even getting halftime shots up just talking to zubac on the clippers side lol That is a man defeated Id like to think that Im a knowledgeable food person, dare I say cultured. But I just had a revelation that makes me feel like a idiot I did not realize that Buffalo mozzarella was made from
buffalo milk Did you think it was cheese made at Bills tailgates? I just thought it was the style, a false cognate!!! https://twitter.com/billsimmons/status/1202079466316451840?s=21 Should I Venmo request Russ for the $50 he cost me? Three charges taken in the last OT The refs blew that tho lol Hard to feel bad cuz its harden but Christ Harden and Westbrook combined 18 for 68 Blazers going to cover 10.5? Going to finish 13-0 ATS today but 0-1 on the parlay Hot damn Dubov, 13-0 is impressive Days where I cant bet on football are good to me Whoa thats cool How much $$$? No cash bets were just for fun of the competition Hezonja In White flag waved Clippers kept in starters lol Hey guys If its any comfort I hit the clippers -9.5 Im glad you made money It makes ME feel better Haha I was being sarcastic lol Hassan actually was good I thought we abandoned playing real offense because the clippers length is that scary We just went to post ups or ISOs with maybe one pass So scared of turning it over We're so iso heavy this year The Stotts flow has vanished Clippers make it worse tho Im not gonna overreact to tonight For sure but that's been a trend all year Yeah but it was last year too We're top 10 in ISO's and like bottom 5 in assists We were 25 in assists This year we are 29 So we have taken a step back for sure Finished up 275 for the day Good shit dubov If I parlayed 1U on those games I wouldve won $146,338.19 Damn dubov I wish had won that lol You think the bookie would pay lol? Theres no way hes got 150 grand lying around does he? I mean hes several levels below whoever is running this entire thing Ah looks like theres an 8 game limit So wouldve been closer to 5K Yeah Also lol, if you dont like his mins/maxes you can just wait for the game to start and hit live bet lol You can bet additional and minimum is 5 Oh I didnt know that sick Yeah lol neat trick https://twitter.com/cranekicker/status/1202233186203426818?s=12 Lol did anyone get a screenshot!? Lmao no damn thats it https://www.complex.com/life/2019/12/pelotons-market-value-dropped-by-942-million-in-one-day Peloton lost almost a billion in market value cause the ad they did bombed so hard lmao How does that make sense everyone is talking about the ad Their stock price ? nah Next step: Jussie smollete peloton ad Get people really talkin I love that this makes people think theyd stop buying peloton https://www.fastcompany.com/90438283/maybe-its-time-to-consider-that-peloton-is-trolling-us-all-with-its-advertising?utm_source=Hashtag+Sports&utm_campaign=29a0f6a32d-HSD_July_30_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_ebc768df89-29a0f6a32d-309860041 I saw all the skinny white people in the ad and now Im thinking of buying a peloton because I want to be skinny and white I dont like your sarcasm - I worked very hard to fit into that demographic Blazers -4 vs Kings
Hawks +3 vs Nets
Memphis +6 @ Bulls Thoughts? Pacers pick em @ Thunder I like bucks -8.5 a lot Theyve been blowing teams out lately Might have to go BKN -3 tonight in honor of Jay-Zs birthday. Ok I added Blazers and Pacers Are the lakers still on the winning streak? Nah they lost to Dallas Sunday Word theyre +2.5 @ Utah. Are we sure the Jazz are good? I feel like teams typically play okay in Utah because they cant go out anywhere Jazz have lost 4 of 5 Id hit the lakers Blazers are 1-3 ATS on a back to back Miami is 0-2-1 Yeah We 15-3-1 ats overall tho! I dont want to bet against the Zers and Ive been enjoying making money on Heat covers so Ill probably leave it alone I do like the bucks, though And probably the nets Jesus why would you say this now Just text Brock on the side you have any crucial analytical data Lol sorry dude Man some of the lines I bet got steamed up hard Norfolk State getting an extra three points! I mean there are two schools of thought with gambling right One is Any outcome is as likely as any other Like youre just as likely to go 5-5 as you are 10-0 technically right So all the patterns and shit are just random But I hate that attitude ! I dont think thats necessarily true Its better to feel right! I think books shade the favorite and the over a little extra knowing the public will bet it Nobody (except me) wants to root against points I agree dubov! I think there are factors too, like some teams like philly can dominate but also take nights off Where Miami seems to bring it every night, just a lower ceiling Im curious how books factor in rest and how much that shifts lines Spoelstra not coaching tonight Not sure how much that matters Just a heads up Why Rest? Baby Wow congrats on the sex Jesus no spoelstra this is a guaranteed double digit L This is why Disney wouldnt buy twitter ? https://twitter.com/mr_jasonjones/status/1202392083484397568 Hammer the Zers!!!! Oh wow Zers at -5 now https://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/e63d4n/i_found_maurice_harklesss_wallet_and_this_is_what/ I don't understand how so many athletes fail to follow thru on those types of promises. Like it's not a huge deal but if you're not gonna do it, don't make the promise. Just makes you look like a douche U know how many DMs professional athletes get There's a josh Hart one where he bought a N64 from a fan his rookie year and promised tickets to any laker game as part of the payment. Then he blocked the guy (spoiler - it's A LOT) Yeah but he promised the guy the tickets. So he saw that DM and made the promise lol Like have your manager take care of the logistics There's also a chance he forwarded this to his management and they dropped the ball Yeah true. Idk Just makes the player look dumb in the end. Real easy PR win to follow thru on that Ya I agree just giving my two cents Also what if he was with a side chick No Conley for Utah tonight Theyre also starting Ingles and Jeff Green. No excuses LeBron needs 80 tonight Lakers ballin early Jesus Nassir looks like Aminu with the haircut https://twitter.com/dwyanewade/status/1202313082132930563 Zing!

Were definitely not gonna win I mean I hope we do but there is absolutely nothing about the ducks offense in the last month that suggests they can score on this Utah defense Who has Utah beat? With no pressure we are pulling out all the gimmicks Plus Herbert shows up in games like this Who have we beat? The only team that beat them with their 3rd string qb Their best win is what? BYU? I know the players arent but everyone is acting like all they have to do is show up and they will stomp us And our best win is? USC? If Utah plays that game 9 more times they probably win 7 of them Im not saying all they have to do is show up But one team is playing their best football of the season and one isnt Not you but the media is acting like we are a scrub cuz we lost to asu So $100 on the spread and $50 on the ML? Lets see when they actually have to play someone with all the pressure on them If I was willing to bet against my team I wouldve hammered that -6.5 Their loss to usc was on a Friday night too.. Stanford Steve said he thinks arroyo is gonna show out because hes in the mix for a HC job to which I say LOL GOOD FUCKING LUCK Were gonna have to start fast Lord knows we aint coming back from shit I actually agree with that - we are gonna run variations of that trick play we ran against Arizona - Mark it I was just trying to convince Mark to bet his life savings on the ducks. I actually dont believe we are gonna win the way we have been playing. To be nervous against OSU was it for me is the forecast still swampier than my drawers after Sandis enchilada night? Ya but we had no motivation for OSU since the game technically didnt matter TRUE Anyone else get Kid Rock for their artist of the decade? 19-4 over the last two days but there isnt a single game I like tonight.

But whats the ducks record on games you attended last couple years.... Im not at the game But probably 500 or just above This year Im 1-2 Not my fault asu kicked me out as the ducks defended 3rd and 16.. that doesnt happen and were playing for the playoffs tonight lol I blame Sheriff Joe He trained the cop for sure but the douches name was Morgan Dubov took ducks ML! Speak it into existence I just got a CBD shot in my coffee shop you cant do that shit in Utah Sco Ducks Ducks 2 ways for me Eh There are plenty of good ways to get scammed in Utah Ian when you get old like me youll get into CBD Lol Im just kidding, I spend like half my disposable income on vinyl for its warmer sound If you believe it then its true! Cbd with out thc is bunk Keep my name out of this Good thing I smoked a lot of weed earlier today If the ducks and blazers both win today I won't have any underwear left The greatest reason for the ducks to win is the Pac-12 loves cannibalizing itself and this way no one makes it into the playoffs Why are lakers only -4 End of a road trip, theyve been undefeated on the road so far this year Maybe Vegas thinks theyre due for a close one I was hoping for 6.5-7 As long as LeBron doesn't take his shoes off before the game is over it's a moral victory Bro I hit lakers at -3.5 https://twitter.com/pchopz_/status/1203112706099859456?s=12 Mello for love straight up Who says no? Impossible to do salary wise Would have to be whiteside And Melo cant be traded since we literally just signed him Ill be at Melos place in 30 to take him to the airport tell him to be ready Youre gonna get off that mello hate train some day Dubov. And when you do Ill be waiting there at the train station holding a sign that says I told you so lol you really think Melo is gonna change the way he plays? Look at how hes been bullying people He doesnt need to change What hes been doing for us
Is great Im saying thats the only way Ill stop hating his game In relation to Cams comment Ahh for sure Dubov is a Pop pers Hes helping us win so thats the style I prefer Purist if you will Box out, chest pass, layup kinda guy Losing is a less good style imo I cant disagree with you on that gundy But the rockets win games and I fucking hate the way they play I cant watch their games Mo Wagners little bro out here splashing threes for Michigan Dubov he has changed! He only jab steps 3 times before a shot instead of 4 I'm taking Melo over Love right now anyway. Sorry Cleveland Trade CJ for Love straight up, move Dame to the 2 and let Melo run the Point Forward Did you guys listen to Chris Hayes on Lowe Post? I haven't watched Love play at all this year, but his stats say washed Whoa did you guys know that Herbert grew up two miles from Autzen stadium? For real? Can't believe they've never mentioned that til now Can you believe the ducks are dominating right now? Probably not Jesus if he gets ejected for this How else is he supposed to tackle him he didnt need to tackle him at all He was already going down (I saw as I get to watch in slow mo) *say Yeah but you hit him and stop him short by a hard Yard* Thank god Wow caught a break there https://www.instagram.com/p/B5wMO9xAuPr/?igshid=jld2plwk1soh Lebron to Portland confirmed!

I learned in mktg 410 that by law you can't actually drink in alcohol ads. That's why it's always just people about to cheers or something So how did she just chug her whole drink? Does Reynolds just not give a fuck about the laws Legal is a funny thing Maybe cuz not on TV but it's on internet ? I think if its not on broadcast you the rules are different. Been awhile since Ive worked in ad but space probably can shed some light I dunno Wow pretty crazy cam we said the same thing I just said it dumber Chad were getting the sloppy big12 ship... More concise I would say Baylor win and LSU ass whooping of Georgia and mayyyyyybe we have a chance! Ahhh that makes sense tho Space please chime in and confirm! Clemson has to go down then you never know Actually since he posted it I think they can do legit anything they want. Remembering now that Im paid digital placements you also cant show people drinking. In paid digital* Doesn't 1 loss Clemson still get in over 2 loss Oregon tho Defending champs Fuck ou Not with their schedule But Oregon getting in at this point is highly unlikely anyway Lol what.

Great day. Just you and the wifey? Oklahoma really wants to get in playoff... Sauce town to Orlando that's quite the move I imagine similar amounts of rock n revival jeans are worn in both cities tho If one of these teams are going to be #4 then watch osu and LSU to put a bunch of style points on board tonight to get #1 If Georgia loses a close one to LSU I still prefer them over either of these trash teams Prob Wouldn't happen tho Weak ending Have fun losing in semi for 4th straight year But ya go Georgia Ruiz-Joshua baby Just threw down on Ruiz +200 I cant watch it text me updates Joshua is winning IMO but Ruiz has landed a few quality shots Look for Ruiz to work the body, Joshua to gas and get clipped Hes got a bitch chin Ruiz got cut in the first round but hes fine now Ruiz is powered by tamales Ruiz looking extra thick Joshua is also dancing on him Fuck I didn't realize this fight was in the middle of the day Joshua with a clinic man Also Andy just showed up too heavy If you want to sound like a big boxing guy at the water color this week talk about how they fought in a bigger ring too Gave Joshua more room to stick and move Matt I'm gonna use that at the pre game tonight "ya you know the larger ring size combined with Ruiz coming in 15 pounds heavier than the first fight really didn't do him any favors in there" "just my two cents " "But what do I know right" "Joshua had a great game plan and he stuck to it" "Ruiz's camp wanted him to begin training for the rematch in july, he reported in September, you have to wonder if that played a factor" Now onto ufc Yassss Its that time again!

Also I started pascal over Sanu give me a fucking award ? Gunde were in a barn burner in jcsl Wow absolutely brutal loss in the super liga Extremely poor roster management on my part this week. I should be fired as GM. So I was coaching out at a middle school in Gresham and it turns out that Marcus Harvey is an assistant for a MAC middle school team. My buddy I coach with knows him and went over to say hi. Marcus said hey to me and then he just followed me on IG and liked a photo from last year where Im wearing a Portland gear hat lol Lakers-Bucks finals and AD-Giannis is gonna be a classic ? ? https://twitter.com/bbcbreaking/status/1203984154993594369?s=21 So apparently Icarus wasnt playing around https://twitter.com/mikeclaynfl/status/1204078620425281536?s=21 Fraud Can't wear a nose ring and put up those fraudulent numbers I was just saying this to a co-worker You talk to your co-workers?

Kawhi load management tonight Im worried that his knee thing is really going to shorten his career NBA careers are going to continue to shorten every year unfortunately Eventually were gonna get about 5-6 years from the best players That what makes LeBron so special man ?Me just waiting for all my winnings to show up in my bank account Ugh I wanna die Did anybody watch the Silicon Valley finale I did not I have not Watched watchmen tho I thought it was a pretty good ending Look on the bright side Ian ?

I really just need the Wolves to go 25-35 down the stretch. Ooooohhhhh baby there are some boomers that are super mad online about the nike swoosh on MLB jerseys lmao Patriots doing shady shit ? Apparently not It was approved by the Browns PR and they were filming content for themselves of their advance scout ? Were a third of the way through the fantasy season. Can the Atlanta Cocks find it within themselves to rally Its still anybodys to win! Pelicans pick em vs Detroit? Nah They suck Ok Pelicans were fun for a few weeks and aside from beating the blazers theyve been pretty bad Oh yeah I would definitely take the pistons in that scenario. Is Blake playing Has he been playing? Lemme check He has been I think he dunked on Giannis the other night Really need the bucks to kick the shit out of the magic tonight No Markief Morris, Khryi Thomas and Reggie Jackson to remind the magic where they belong In the gutter They havent played since Friday Going for 15 straight I think V rested The bucks Sounds like Pistons is the play? Yeah I would go pistons If I were to bet Might hit a little teaser here with the Pistons, Bucks, Clips No Kawhi tonight I mean who wants betting advice from the moron who pissed away $1,440 I really cant wait for the pacers to get Dipo back Yeah I know but if I can tease clips up to 8.5 I still like them But curious about the ligas thoughts on kawhi-less clippers +1.5 @ Indy They could be a legit dark horse if hes back to being regular Dipo Paul George revenge game? 2 teams removed Lol define legit dark horse? You can rebuilt it! They could make the conference finals Legit dark hose to make the second round? If Dipo is Dipo Honestly the last two weeks Ive been up until the weekend But thats a long ask Nahhhh Considering his injury He probably needs a year like Hayward I fucking love Dipo and Nate and the eastern conference But theyre overachievers Too many good teams in the top half of the East I think Brogdon gives them a legit No. 2 option But yes they are overachieving Milwaukee, philly, Toronto, Boston and yes Miami Are all better teams ?I mean if this is how theyre gonna position in Im hammering clips I mean you did say dark horse So fair Pacers are good But so are the clips! Im honestly excited to have such a great matchup Thats gonna be a good game Everything else sucks tonight Kawhi

O coordinator?? The shitty part is were probably gonna promote from within lol Ugh Who though would get promotion? Maestro?

Giants played him too ruining his .500 record like that last night lol He's actually the exact opposite of a loser. He beat the goat twice Hes got more rings than Russ ?? Wowow clay with the flamethrower Less playoff appearences Sounds like he's more efficient when he gets there Actually their playoff stats are crazy similar Russ still younger than Eli @ #2SB tho I mean Brock you may not think he is but Eli WILL be a HOFer You can say no all you want its a no brainer hell get in Yah I know he will, but he def doesnt deserve Im not even arguing it really but if his criteria isnt good enough then like half the HOF inductees shouldnt be there lol Youve just got stricter standards for your personal HOF Brocks hall is like Russ Wilson, Shaun Alexander and Walter Jones. I just cant wait to see who they keep out instead Lol well two of those guys are mortal locks Sorry Phil rivers doesnt get me hard At no point was Eli a top 5 guy Gundy did you see KOC's Portland trade proposal yesterday? If not, grab an extra pair of shorts ? Hopefully it was better than CJ for Aaron Gordon which was suggested on the windhorst pod yesterday Omg Ive always liked KOC Always been a huge fan Really love his team building philosophy Aaron Gordon can fuck right off Gundy I'm a huge fan of that trade. We'd be thin at wing but those are a dime a dozen Dude what is Baze giving us 4 man big rotation of Love, Nurkic, TT and ZC next year Just put Trent and Nas out there Oh baby Play 3 guards more Yeah Baze is nothing but a warm body this year Baze got a of steals but neutralizes it by fouling a ton And he doesnt make shots or good decisions with the ball Yo sidebar for you NY bros - I am flying in tomorrow around 4.

Wow these second halves are gonna be nuts. Ajax and Dortmund need goals. Zenit needs to hold on to the draw. Hold on to your butts! Absolutely dreadful performance by zenit Damn another shooting in jersey city this time. Sounds like a cop is dead. Bet there will be some extra Ts & Ps. Getting into a debate at work Is drinking a glass of milk normal or abnormal behavior ? I drink the shit out of milk Feel like its pretty normal tho I dont personally drink a ton of milk Do you actually buy milk at the grocery store? Like to drink? i dont anymore cause it goes bad but I take it from my office My wife is white. Yes. Kelseys white? I think its officially strange now Im just saying I do buy milk for the house only for her I dont ever drink it unless Im having a cookie I buy a single gallon occasionally but only to put in coffee So youre telling me nobody in this chat eats cereal? No milk for me as an adult. Drank a shit ton growing up and in college I cant do milk in the mornings I use water for that Cameron Fucks me up You ca def use milk for other stuff. But millennials and younger not drinking a glass of milk Jk Vs when we were young I drank milk more than water im pretty sure Thats why Brock and I have the same build #MilkBoiiiizzz I got milk at voodoo donuts the other day I did drink probably about a gallon a week as a child At least But for dessert Does ice cream count as milk cause if thats the case make that 2 gallons I just poured a glass of milk at work with my lunch and everyone is calling me a weirdo I put almond milk on my morning granola. I also have a 401K and think you need to turn down that rap music. And you love Biden Im v into oat milk My new fav milk alt No malarkey We also saw a lot of people do the gallon challenge 2.0 Maybe that changed us Yeah I associate milk with Mark in a diaper Wow I didnt even realize the subconscious But thats totally a trauma associated with milk Lmaoo You will never catch me buying food coloring again I'm with rengel. I only have milk for coffee Lmao Matt Barnes talking on his podcast about swallowing a whole blunt cause the cops pulled him over Guys I just realized something awful Hezonja has a goddamn player option God fucking dammit Trade him for Love https://twitter.com/mattbooshell/status/1204251979570135040?s=20 Just peed next to Tinker FUCK OFF Thats pretty neat Did you cross swords? Is it true he loves high tops so he can tuck the tip of his Weiner into them? Hes not as short as I thought Thought he was a tripod Talking to my last lyft passenger about 2012 rose bowl - unprompted.. Russel Wilson is a HOF er and hes a cards fan How much did Dylan tip you? Just the tip Melo O/U 17.5 tonight. Are you Melo stans hammering? Over FOR SURE Dame O25.5 is attractive I would for sure hit the Over In both respects They splitting a 50 piece tonight Whos coaching the knickerbockers these days Desus? Yea dame over 25.5 seems ?? Mike Miller but not That Mike Miller Just hit it for $5 0 Former G League coach of the year So I already took the blazers -9, would it be dumb to also take the Millard over? Lillard Feels like dame might sit out a a lot of the fourth if its a blowout FOH Davis Bertans had 60 fantasy points? Dame going for 60 IRL tonight Dame fuego Omg Heat starting OT on a 15-0 run lol Omg I had heat -8.5 Like a huge bet lol God is good And sixers -4 Hell yeah dude Its coming back! And blazers -9 lol Thank god lol Id lost 7 straight bets! Hezonja revenge game I mean its kinda wack to brag about stats in an OT game vs the hawks But bam and jimmy had triple doubles And Nunn had 36! But jimmy made no greater contribution Just picked up Nunn for Coby White in fantasy Than missing the buzzer beater at the end of regulation GM of the Year candidate right here Chad still giving me the business Dame has 25 at half Lmao https://www.instagram.com/p/B56wcvXgaQI/?igshid=17pksg1q5221o Incredible choke lmao Heat dont lose at home man Lakers on Friday is gonna be a fucking show Eh We really need dragic back Weve needed huge late runs to beat the wizards the bulls and the hawks at home Id never bet against the heat but No dragic or Winslow is tough Tragic and will keep your wins low if he stays out https://twitter.com/br_nba/status/1204620851896676352?s=21 Jimmy has no chill. also heat ML vs lakeshow Friday?!?!? Dame also cleared the over with ease Who else bet it? Idk I just now he hit it in the first half Im pretty sure Had 25 in the first hit a 3 in the 3rd First half* Lol I bet it Plus zers -9 Everybody happy $1400? Great night had by all Hahahaha I wish lol Im never doing that shit again ^ famous last words Im gonna go hard this week and then retire for a lil while Takes too much of a toll lol That said! Lakers -6.5, rockets -10.5 and Celtics +1.5 Ill trail you Shit imma take the raptors tomorrow too I think theyre gonna come out on fire Bucks -13 is also a hammer IMO Pelicans SUCK Yeah Ill hit that too, its been on my mind 13 is just a lot Raptors line isnt out yet on my end Yeah thats true and its the kind of game a young team could get up for I got burned by the bucks -12 yesterday against the magic Potentially snapping the streak could be a major motivator Yeah I mean the bucks will win comfortably Pelicans are bad Just may not be 13 But theyre not cavs/Knicks bad I dont really like the rockets The cavs are just such a mess and love just basically told everyone hes checked out I was going back and fourth between rockets and bucks Rockets have injuries Eric Gordon our Out Austin rivers Just means more run for harden and Westbrook Kinda bummed I hammered lakers -7 and it dropped half a point Magic are feisty But Lakers are gonna whoop that ass Everyone playing for them? Yeah ? Avery Bradley back and no rondo Lakers are rested and going through a dominant stretch Basically a plus lmao Anthony Davis never takes a game off He wants mvp Until he blows something out Hopefully not tomorrow! And DPOY Yeah Him vs John Isaac tomorrow is the block battle Such a beast Yeah hes insane Hes literally made life so easy for lebron God the fucking heat lol I was like totally resigned to the fact Id lost money I cant believe that happened -9 Down 6 under a minute left It was like a 22-0 run Cover Thats gotta be like less than 1% Probability Yeah dude I bet the ML Was like Heat +700 with a minute left Live Hahahaha legendary The heat are reeling tho Jimmy is now a triple double guy I cant believe how good bam is becoming He shut Siakam down which was pretty bad ass Hes got great all skills! He can run a fast break now lol I have no idea where it came from I was blown away at his assist total The fact that we have bam, nunn, herro and Duncan Robinson despite never picking in the top 10 is just incredible I really need more Duncan Robinson coverage I cant believe he played DIII hoops Lol Duncan went 10-14 from 3 today That said were not actually playing v well rn We need dragic back stat Who would guess the heat would have 2 of the top 3 ROY candidates Wow space that is incredible I will admit my wrongs and buy a Duncan Robinson jersey That's impressive Lol I mean youre fine, there was literally no way for anyone to know he was gonna be as good as his is lol Wut now youre gonna tell me you were sleeping on Kendrick Nunn? Yo mark/dubov If you want lakers tomorrow theyre -6.5 on the Sportsbook at -7.5 on Bovada So Id get em now Already hit em Hit it Saw a good response to Trae Young on Twitter ? https://twitter.com/liz_franczak/status/1204796555561029632 That lakers line has moved to 8.5 you guys saved two points ? Jalen Rose the hairline ?? Yo should we buy heat zers tix? While the blazers still suck? Tix are pretty cheap rn You could line all these homies up Chad I see you sig ep barber shop We are doing the row situation I thought? I had the same thought this week Ian Now is the time to strike Before they fatten up at home and get to .500 How many are we again? We not doing rip city row anymore? 8 is the max you can get on the ticket master app Regardless Im in So we probably do need to do a row? Kuzma out for the Lakers Not a big deal tbh lol Ahhh yeah I mean if Bradleys back Not so bad Bradley back, rondo questionable Yeah the line didnt even move Kuz has barely impacted games this year honestly Hes had like 3 big games Hes just not as crucial with AD Jalen Rose kept saying Kuz was the 3rd leg of their big 3 last summer lol Soft move Honestly I think theyre better off in crunch time playing AD and Dwight Than throwin Kuz in there Giannis out tonight Did anyone already hit the bucks? New team name who this God I saw the line jump to -10 and almost hammered the shot out of it ?????? And then was like Somethings up here Im not actually gonna bet but I would think about a pelicans play Yeahhh I dunno the bucks are still pretty good sans giannis But at 10 I guess thats value When dipo and Kylie come back we can start having East vs west fights again East is better now Hey dubov they're talking about tik Tok on this webinar I'm listening to I just wrote that for some branded content I just did but I legit believe it More teams with 16-plus wins, more teams with above-.500 records Yeah its deeper for sure But you still have lakers clippers in the west And the Bucks just whooped the Clippers asses Yeah Toronto spanked the Lakers Denver is having an awful East road trip Utah just had one the west has been a major disappointment Hey look youre preaching to the choir! 69% of tik Tok users are Gen Z ! I mean when Durant comes back discussion is over lol https://www.nbcsports.com/northwest/portland-trail-blazers/big-time-players-trail-blazers-are-probably-not-going-after Dwight laying it out: Love, Blake Or LaMarcus My gut tells me Olshey wants Blake most Blake would be fun Didnt he draft Blake Or is my timing off Yup thats why Olshey loves his guys I would be so fucking down with Blake Also with Steve Blake if he wanted to make another run at it Careful guys don't make space laugh too hard I almost got ran outta the chat last time we talked Blake Blake Whiteside and Anfernee for Blake Sell high on Ant he gonna suck, started hot and immediately tailed off. Nah just give them a protected first Hes essentially Elijah Daniels We need to keep as much shooting as possible Troy Daniels He was dealing with some injuries last few weeks Wait we could get Blake for a protected 1st round? If Detroit thinks they can sign someone with cap space and they wanna open up more room to keep Drummond Then we could help them do that I think Love and TT is still the best deal tho. Cause we get TTs bird rights and hed be a perfect backup for us Blake would be so lit We'd have to give them more than whiteside and a first IMO Probably whiteside, Trent, little and 2 firsts Look at the Porzingis trade. That could be a benchmark We getting Blake Justice and a pick Throw in dragic for salary matching That'd be a dope team Ugh yeah Would prob have to Sad tho dragic is such a warrior Hes a huge part of their success this year We could always take on Tony snell for bazemore gundy. Give Detroit even more cap room next summer Snell is dope https://twitter.com/oufergie/status/1204812101715402757?s=21 Yeah we need a wing Who actually is good at defense And doesnt foul all the time Robert Covington vs Utah or Joe Harris Vs Charlotte The rare too many players with games fantasy basketball conundrum Joe Harris gets buckets Big thx to josh Richardson coming back from injury, locking my roster, and scoring 3 pts when I dropped someone to start him For the record Im playing you Chad Reverse psychology! Maybe Covington should be the play ?? Maybe it's Harris! Who knows! Ok I can't even front on that mistake. Please state who you're playing before soliciting suggestions in the future Well fuck I didnt know that Giannis was out tonight Harris it is! Wow no Fultz for Orlando Lakers are about to really whoop on them with just DJ augustin https://twitter.com/chold/status/1204894685824634881?s=21 Can't wait for the Blake/Nurk front court in February 2020 Nurk Gunz what happened to Gary Harris? He averaged 18 two years ago. He's putting up 10 points on 41% shooting this year Nuggets fans like to blame Murray But now hes just not good Will Barton has arguably been their best player Hes too 5 in real plus minus Top* Ah mr 50/40/90 himself, Jamal Murray lol ? With these goons 3/15th of the liga! Hoomie tell us more about mila kunis Houman thinks shes Hispanic Good to see basketball on in the background, it just seems right She kinda looks it but Mila is not a Hispanic name The only Mila I know is a Balkan chick Love me some Balkan bitches Mark tell em about our last Balkan bitch escapades in Prague! Oh you mean skittles in the foreskin and blood on your pants? Or when I almost died I got the linebacker version of mila kunis with the toe in the ass All of this happened about 50 yards away from the Adriatic Oh That. Yea youre talking about Prague, not Croatia Murph and I took the sexy massage ladies, Dylan got a very large woman who wouldnt remove her clothes and rubbed him only with her feet. The crescendo involved her big toe in Dylans ass.

We all paid the same price.

Sales guys: whats it called when youre putting all the calls out at the end of the quarter trying to make your goals? Like whats the terminology you use Shotgun tactic Its called rawdogging Dialing for dollars Spray & Pray Use that theyll know what u mean Deadspin traffic down from 20m/month to 2m/month Lol I mean they havent posted anything in weeks Ahh. I refuse to check The bosses tried to post shit and it was all terrible Then the guy who forced everyone to fire resigned Like a week after the whole staff quit Tangentially related - I listened to a Recode Media podcast with the guys who own and operate Maven/bought SI. Theyre a bunch of fucksticks lol Dude those guys tried to hire me before they bought SI It was a fucking pyramid scheme They force all their contributors to register as LLCs instead of contractors so they can skirt liability They said something in the (very contentious) interview with Peter Kafka that one of their college writer makes $850K And I almost shit myself from laughing so hard Yeah they sell those stories like we have guys making six figures a year it all sounded very much like Veema Like thats what it reminded me of when I was in the presentation It is entirely possible that there is a person out there that writes college basketball content for a Maven owned blog that makes $850K per year, but it isnt from Maven Also if I was maven I would shut up after how their USC guy fucked up the clay Helton story https://soundcloud.com/lane8music/lane-8-winter-2019-mixtape to get you through the rest of your day No Anthony Davis tonight for the lake show Idk if that affects any bets Damnit Goddamnit Rui is out too?

Thank you sir tho Whats the food situation like, you gonna have a strong popcorn game? BYOF Its surrounded by good food spots So... no popcorn? Actually idk the answer to that. Probably not? Olde Midway Commercial Popcorn Machine Maker Popper with Large 12-Ounce Kettle - Red Oh nice I love a BYOF situation https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N6JVSLD/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_xsB-DbTHA76J8 Bang bang BYOF V hot right now, no complaints.

If you have Pfriem on tap I will drink $250 worth of it to fund the popcorn machine ill let management know Lmao PatBev just said we aint fuckin around in the post game Can someone explain why the cavs are getting 3.5 points against the hornets? The hornets are def bad but theyre 4 out of there last 5 with wins over the kings and nets The Cavs have 6 wins.... I mean sorry The hornets are +3.5 @ Cleveland Second day of a back to back going home then road? Also Washington/Batum/Williams are out Yeah I feel you but its fucking Cleveland at worst its a tossup Yea Im betting the hornets What about heat +7 Like the hornets guys are graham, rosier and bridges I dunno dude the heat are really hurt rn The sixers love beating the shit out of the heat I love betting on the heat I did it Yeah I mean same Also Boston +1.5 @ Dallas with no Luka Lol Heres the thing I think its a bit of a secret That dragic is still arguably are best scorer Sorry, Celtics -1.5 but still Hes far from the second most (trade) valuable but as of right now hes the second best player on the team If he gets healthy and heat start getting soft lines Yeah I like Celtics I love the hornets tho Damn Celtics/Hornets/Heat it is Tho Im retired from big bets Final numbers; week 1: +870 week 2: -404 week 3: +690 week 4: -340 week 5: +1070 The Mavs just beat the shit out of the Bucks on the road Yeah some games are just weird tho Could be a totally anomaly I need a latter Dubov! Pattern* So youre saying we should parlay it Dubov? Dont talk to me about sample size, Ian! Thats my thing! Huh!? You dont like it or do? I demand it. I love it so much. Give me sample size or take your weak ass stats elsewhere. However... Mavs look solid. Yeah It can be a trick too tho Like its weird I swear it just comes down to philosophy Like say you bet on 10 games 10-0 is just as like as 5-5 which is as likely as 0-10.... sort of. That said hey! Nice year Im not even getting on that Mavs game Week 4 was the great massacre I went from 1440 sat night to paying out 340 lol But I got down big early last week and rallied But This shit is bad for me heart lol Ive kinda realized if you take it seriously its basically just like a job lol Im not enjoying basketball v much while is do this I* Today I clawed back $140 of the $271 I dropped yesterday. The 4 games I lost today were each by a bucket so it couldve been more. Yeah lol, its wild tho its funny I won a grand in Bovada, won a grand in bet online and lost a grand in your bookieso when I cashed out it was like everybody won except the betting sites I get 1k Landon gets 1k gamblings sites lose 2k But hey A few 25-50 dollar bets a week Need to restrain myself to appreciate that Still tho And most importantly Why the fuck are the Cavs 3.5 point favorites against anyone? Dont get me wrong the could very well win but I like the hornets in a 50/50 thats value! Ian you should have paid attention in statistics ? The more coins you flip the more likely you end up in the middle of the distribution Betting $100 on 10 games is far less risky than betting $1000 on one game so what youre saying is that we should be $1000 on 10 games Any idea how ducks football is looking recruiting wise today? Im out of the loop and dont recognize any names so far. Its sort of what we expected Its a good class, heavy on the 4* whats the significance of today Its early signing day I think Oh gotcha sick go ducks All I know is we got the next Sewell bro At this point theres no huge positional need its more adding depth at WR, secondary and OL Its national signing day Were gunna land the number 1 and 2 inside linebackers this cycle.

The Cavs are my shitty team of choice All in in Belein! I have made money betting against the Cavs, I will continue to do so Can the hornets be considered a shitty team? Because theyre my money pony right now Its sort of a strange phenomenon Hornets are mediocre I would say Vegas treats them as true bottom tier tho The Hornets are overachievers Yeah they had the lowest O/U number in the preseason Also the spurs are the worst ats team this year A lot of people may not be on this devonte graham thing Still Yeah Rozier is playing really well too Also PJ Washington is one of the best post players in the league His efficiency is top 5 I think up there with LeBron Lol I will say ever since we became unhealthily addicted to gambling https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX8D2YR1GbW3K?si=5qpE-XdnQnCF2G2b6qSasg For anybody looking for a trip down memory lane Our broad knowledge of the nba has really gone up!

I was listening to the new book of basketball And they reminded me how much Kyrie ate Stephs lunch In 2016 Well steph sucks so yeah lol Kyrie was so legit in that series Celtics better without him this year tho Totally He didnt know how good he had it with LeBron Him and Kd will probably be sick Lol They gonna move Dinwiddie? Dinwiddie should have his own team But he could be like their Lou Will Could he fetch a lottery pick?

AD game time decision according to my girl Allie LaForce Grizzlies -1 @ Cavs tomorrow Just texted my VP who's in Vermont with his family right now and said "you mind if I give you a ring real quick?"

He goes "yeah" Does that mean yeah call him or yeah he minds??? I'm so confused HAHA Ferk thats tough I would say that its all systems go and if he doesnt answer then you were wrong ? That means you can call him 1) he wouldve said Ill call you later if thats what he meant and 2) Im sure he welcomes any opportunity to get the fuck away from his family Feel like he would have said no or Im busy if you couldnt Ah for sure Those also Yeah Besides most successful business men use work as a channel to get away from their family life! But also chad you gotta ask clearer questions that dont leave the door open for confusion Hell love it! At least thats what I learned on tv Can I call you in two minutes to talk about _____ Alright I called him it was a yes AD playing He didn't bite my head off Despite the fact that I was the corporate bro from that video and I'm dropping my pants on this discount 10% 
20% final offer! 
30%?!.. okay fine you got a deal https://youtu.be/iT-jrDFgkq4 ^chad So basically youve got a absolute minimum you can sell for and still make money and its just a chess game of trying to figure out what that is? Plus an added wrinkle of having a boss whose watching over your numbers ready to replace you if he doesnt like what he sees? Do I understand sales? Ian you've nailed it Correct Its great Lolol Its like gambling but for your job Just one dick measuring contest after another Then there's also this strategy (which I'm doing right now), where you say fuck everything and just offer whatever will get the deal done and deal with the consequences later. It's called "ask for forgiveness not permission" Hopefully I'm still employed tomorrow! I just had a sales company call me from online dialer but disguised there number as a 503 area code so I'd answer U guys r monsters Their* I get calls from 971 all the time ? "hey is this Matt?"

Is Luka playing? No Luka He dedw Ded* D.E.D ESPN app is completely worthless. I took Rockets yesterday cuz it said Booker was Out.

Hornets +13? Did mark already hammer? God I want to so bad Hornets! They dogged me last night by 1 point Me too. Im rolling with the Tillotson(sp) 5 If Im up this afternoon Ill ?? the Warriors Man I was so drunk when I repeated brocks picks back to you last night. I forgot to bet them! (A non space ??, like Im not gonna put my life savings into a eastern conference back to back) I was drinking on Belmont street last night. I did a bunch of Jell-O shots at the triple nickel I drank so much bourbon last night. I love the holidays Michael Thomas gonna break the single season catch record today? Only needs 11 Hornets are 6-1 ATS with no days off +13 thats a lot of points at home! Its a lock Ok ok Hornets and lakers Are commercial airplanes faster now than they were in say the 80s ? Do we get places faster as they marginally improve year over year? On a flight , just a random shower thought. I would assume they are faster today then they once were but also have no clue Probably should have kept that one to myself ?? Interesting that the shape of commercial planes also have not changed much cause I would say that aerodynamics could also help them be faster but again they look pretty much the same Ya I feel like there's just a threshold to where you'd be going too fast and it wouldn't be comfortable https://twitter.com/espn/status/1208793586319450112?s=12 Brother barner reppin Dubov get me that jersey for xmas Ill Venmo u Its sold out on .com I think the duck store still has some Yes what Rengal said Also we should all aspire to be this gramps when we are old https://www.instagram.com/p/B6XfGtdA1Mf/?igshid=1oppcsimdjffo Omg hahaha grandpa got more swag than all of us Fucking dripping wet Must have a solid 401k to fund all that heat https://twitter.com/iraheatbeat/status/1208800832306724865?s=21 First team all corny Reminds of the time I wrote Ian an apology for breaking his bong piece Was it an illadelph? Omg I completely forgot about that lol Theyre prolly more aerodynamic for fuel efficiency rather than speed right? Theyre lighter too so they can hold more passengers? Which means more money for airlines They also charge you for carry ons now Remember when they used to give everyone a free pancake breakfast on morning flights Airlines are boomers Interesting thoughts though Matt usually I just jerk off in the shower instead Sonic booms were also a big problem ?These are the seats of the future. Cram even more people onto the plane! If the plane goes faster than sound it makes a huge sound Only thing louder are the 12s!!!! What were those super fast planes called they discontinued in the 90s Wish I could have flown on one of those Matt are you en route to the sauce right now Just landed at PDX See you at paddingtons But Chad to answer ur question I am a Portland now, I abandoned the sauce long ago. I believe the old Long property is now a winery. Brock. I have some concerns about these picks. Wow you and Clayton are both no longer sauce town residents It saddens me greatly to have abandoned that which gave me so much but home is where your family is and all mine are in Portland now. The sauce is essentially the giving tree I'm gonna tell my parents all the cool parents are moving out The cool parents live in Monmouth Gundy apparently there's a new creole restaurant in salem called Noble Wave that I feel like you'd appreciate And it's not owned by a white lady that went to New Orleans once Dude theses picks went to hell within 30 seconds of every game My Saints pick not looking great https://twitter.com/cp3/status/1208620234875310080?s=21 Lol cp3 leftout kenan Savage ?(For context ) Is there a backstory there?

Then i wander back onto twitter replies Heat shouldve covered That was such a shit cover by Utah lmao Im big mad about that one Gobert had no reason to shoot that last shot other than to pass his own stats He also had two put backs on missed 3s in the last minute That part is on Miami obvi But that last bucket goddamn Ok Im over it.

Hope you all got that Peloton you wanted. ?I dont mean to flex this early in the morning but Also Gordon Hayward is back for Boston Gundy you gotta warn us before posting that much heat!! Just came my pants Removed a laugh from Gundy you gotta warn us before posting that much heat!! Removed a laugh from Gundy you gotta warn us before posting that much heat!! May god be with all the men that are being gifted team Jordan's from their girl right now ???? Happy holidays! this year be kind to yourself and gift yourself tickets to see the blazers take on the Miami Heat at the Moda Center on February 9th! Thats on you bro Is that an #ad in the liga ? We think the favorites are gonna roll today? Clippers I like that I want to do a small money Christmas ML parlay I did all 5 games Boston
Bucks
Rockets
Clippers
Nuggets? Bucks/philly seem to be the toss up Yeah thats what I did And it is a toss up but I gotta ride with giannis I did all favorites. Clippers lakers is a coin toss so I had to go with the best player on the court Kawhi? ?? Can I make a prop bet on if Enes Kanter will make it back to the United States? I took bucks and clippers spread also -400 no 7-0 raptors! The parlay is fucked! I couldnt add Boston so mine is a 4 way Sharps are heavy lakers too fwiw I bet on Milwaukee and if I win that Im gonna bet lakers Sometimes I get so stressed I just don't watch the games I'm betting on. Then I realized that kinda defeats the purpose of betting Celtics live ML is still -145 https://twitter.com/adam_mares/status/1209875415466045440?s=21 Accurate Lol I mean they had first take on before the games Do they not watch Stephen A and Max? Any player props we like today? Im intrigued by:

J. Holiday o5.5 ast
LeBron o7.5 reb
B. Simmons o7.5 reb Unsure how I feel about Harden o37.5 pts LeBron double double feels inevitable on Christmas so rebounds is nice Hes also got ast o/u 9.5 but I dont like that as much I love that 37.5 points is a toss up. Harden is unreal Hes has 9 or more rebounds in the last 5 games I like the raptors jerseys, cant tell if I love or hate the Boston jerseys Oh man I would hammer harden Worst defense in the league And the stage Hardens gonna try and get 60 Thats kinda what Im thinking Gundy Love the rockets to crush the warriors Only 1/10th of the way through this parlay. Gonna be a long day lol My picks were Boston -3 rockets -11 ?You guys see this 15 teamer last weekend? 5 bucks netted $100k I took Jokic o19.5 because I hate myself Holy shit Heat tix on u then Chad Gundy is gonna cash one of those one day and we're all going to Ibiza on him Gundy how cognizant would you say nba guys are of Vegas lines? Like do they low key wanna cover? Do they care at all? How long til they out the line on the scoreboard I loved Rovell getting ripped by gamblers yesterday He posted about how Hawaii has this unreal home field advantage. And people were like yo they're 20-20 in their last 40 home games and have a top 5 worst ATS record in the last 3 seasons lol https://youtu.be/u4yCFPKrqDE lmao this is so good Gundy how realistic is a 3 way trade that sends Love to Boston and Hayward to Portland Hayward's looking nice Brock! We need some wing scoring. Plus expiring contract Can sign him for cheaper next season Dame, CJ, Hayward, Collins, Nurk. With Baze, Hood, Simons and Little off the bench ?? Celtics arent really the team to pull a fast one on Is that a fast one? They need big man help So what do the blazers give up? Not sure anyone really wants whiteside rn Simons? Whiteside lol Cleveland just wants cap relief and a pick Or at least that's all they can get. Idk how that complicates adding Boston tho. Prob gotta give them something too Throw in all the picks tho. Dames prime is now Dame gonna be Darren Williams in 18 months Lets go Bucks!! Alright boys 1 down, 4 to go Id be down for that chad I think thats a pipe dream Celtics not taking loves contract ino Fair My whole life is pipe dreams ?Theres no such thing as a pipe dream. As the great actor Kevin Garnett once said... Parlay is fucked.

(Tied) https://twitter.com/hohighlights/status/1209958112393940992?s=12 https://www.instagram.com/p/B6gx8OqlVlZ/?igshid=1uouqqwgzhfod this dude looks like turner lol Omg hahaha Boys, content Santa left some gifts under my social media tree this morning. ?? Hahahaha Love it Cam that is gold These are the only memes to be used during blazer games from now on Can we take a liga field trip to giphy HQ so we can all get personalized gifs Does Harden even have a FGA this quarter?!?!?! The only thing in this world I can count on is that I cant count on james harden I would love to house the Liga for some content shoots Wtf are the rockets doing It looks like they just gave up James Harden is a bum!!!! Send him to the G League! Im disappointed #NotMyMVP Maybe its the wine but I think this game could get Mike D fired I'm disgusted Nothing but fraud MVP's today Bodes well for Dubov's clippers pick tho Just another game boys. 1.2% of the season. Yeah rockets burned me I lost $100 on that stupid rockets game. Fuck them. Gamblers call for dantonis head after Rockets drop to a dismal 21-9 Cant wait to hear Bill Simmons dumb take on this Emergency pod in two minutes probably ? Anyone want lakers -2.5? ? damn looks like epic meal time ?? Clayton coming for marks neck Why the fuck is LeBron on the bench I love the grill master battle we have going here We're gonna have to settle this at the pit FIRE FRANK VOGEL ? ? Damn I dont which one of you is beating the others meats That possession was 15 seconds of Danny green holding the ball trying to tell LeBron what to do Im taking the in laws to see uncut gems and they havent seen a trailer Should be exiting Marc and I beat each others meats equally I think hell agree Also Im left handed so its different for him Yo Im stumped on something anyone remember when there was like a doll or something sitting court side at an nba game I think it was a marketing / ad thing Was it for annabelle? Maybe ? It was a mascot for a brand like Taco Bell or some shit I think Mountain Dew mascot ? Lmao AD landing on Kevin Hart Puppy monkey baby!!! ? Yes !! Haha Nightmare fuel Its was Mountain Dew I believe What agency DAVID needs to reenact the book at the blazers half court Toyota shot I think that would have been BBDO But I dunno That was in a time when old spice was getting praise for their outlandish manly man ads and everyone wanted a piece. Feeling good about my lakers title bet The clippers are 2k champions! (Am I drunk, whose to say?) Also my mom, also drunk, wants Anthony Davis to play Frida Kahlo ? ? Player 3 has entered the game. Takes the lead ? No he hasnt he didnt cook that! A London broil!? JCSL meat content next to one Mark is that an #ad too? Lot of promos flowing thru the liga today Who's gettin paid We should sell sponsorship Wow clips ball for sure Oh wow Clippers! Salvaged the night IM UPSET Yeah clippers saved me lol ? That replay was so dumb That was the right call! That's off Beverly ten times outta ten in live speed You can pause and see bron touched it last! If we break every single play down frame by frame you could change every call Of course bron touched it but that's not the point I dont think thats true at all If youre gonna do replay you should get it right In a pickup game that's off Bev every time. Same with every other basketball game reffed in the last 50 years before replay Yeah this is a perfect example of replay going too far Wut lol https://twitter.com/royceyoung/status/1210042499772952576?s=21 I mean either youre for replay or not It's just stupid lol that's not basketball Are you saying they should look at it and get it wrong again? I'm against this lol Use it for goaltends and whether someone's foot was out of bounds or on the 3 point line Did you bet on the lakers? I hate replay in sports in general Watched it live. Its off pat. Move on. It happened in the national championship game last year too. Guy pick pocketed Ty Jerome in the back court out of bounds. Should have been out on the Defense. Replay shows ball barely grazed Jeromes thumb before going out in the direction of the swipe lol it's just stupid Either have human refs or dont. That take is fine lol But advocating for refs to review things and just get it wrong sometimes doesnt make sense lol I mean I'm not saying to review it and purposely get it wrong Lol I'm just saying you can watch that play and call it without dissecting it with a knife There's no reason a play like that needs review https://twitter.com/kingjames/status/846163009638666240?s=21 Yeah but once its being reviewed you should make the right call Lol that is like the quintessential example of the type of play that should be reviewed If you are pro review my least favorite thing in sports is replay. My second least favorite thing in sports is LeBron hash tagging phrases https://twitter.com/fastbreakbreak/status/1210044777581948930?s=21 ? Anyone need 8 cups of pork fat? I do not care about that tweet lol Lebron touched it last and you can freeze frame it Thats way more objective than the player who caused the ball to go out of bounds Im just gonna say Lakers will Beat them 50 bucks to the first taker Lol Bev clearly caused it to go outta bounds Sure In chads defense, Patrick Beverly made LeBron tough it last! ????? Ill take the 50 I'm not saying LeBron didn't touch it last I'm saying that call can easily be made in real time using common sense. Out on the defender. No need to replay I digress Playoff basketball plays to the lakers strengths Mismatch, mismatch, mismatch Yeah I mean its totally fair but playoff basketball seems to favor kawhi Leonard Facts But I bet the lakers end up favored But I think LeBron has me more go Yeah Will be a great series I cant wait Clippers have better role players Hey are we gonna live bet the nuggets??? Honestly i will go If the bros wanna go to la I would go to that over the finals Gundes already been to a finals, theyre so 2000 and late Battle of LA 2020 Im gonna be making multiple playoff related trips this year Heat blazers finals Im down I wanna make an east finals trip Im pretty much set no matter what Philly is a two hour train Boston is a 3 hour bus Barclays is a mile from my house And Milwaukee is an hour outside chi Orlandos only 8 hours Drive Im down to go to Philly or Boston Well Im def gonna go catch a game in Miami Honestly isn Im hoping rd one against Brooklyn Ian Im waiting for the playoffs Thatd be so sick Yes I will make a playoff trip Ok yes Thats perfect But not a regular season I will have enough miles Yeah thats cool My brother cooked that I am a fraud Lets hope we get a good heat matchup I need the NFL playoff pick em Brock are you doing that this year Yah Ill send it out this week Hey the pelicans are a live dog The win doesnt sting as much ? Lmao I was so confident in my parlay last night and I lost 4 out of 5 games That's impressive The three I was confident in lost and my two toss ups won. I hate gambling. https://twitter.com/joeymulinaro/status/1209890301889929216?s=21 The coke bottle is a nice touch lol My god uncut was insane ?

I'll summarize my memories of the night. It was me, space, Rengel, dubov, gundy, Dylan and Dehaan I think?

- we went to a rap battle at some dive bar
- we went to a martini bar and Dylan talked politics with this guy that thought he was gonna fuck him
- went to Mary's strip club and saw a stripper that looked like Katie kresl 
- Brock shattered his iPhone
- Rengel got mugged at an ATM and emptied out his bank account
- Rengel wanted to buy weed to make himself feel better and bought balled up newspaper
- all of us slept in one hotel room and Dylan and I cleaned out the mini bar (sorry space)
- Rengel pissed his pants (sorry Rengel)

Great night! Lol I remember driving down to Portland that day and I pulled off at an Indian casino and won 30 dollarswhich is like 100 when youre in collegeright away and left. Twas a good sign. It was the crack.. happy birthday Ian! Oh yeah and Rengel smoked crack! Haha holy shit I forgot about that Didnt you smile crack with the guys that robbed you?

I said were going to lose in a depressing way. Enter Jordan Clarkson putting 30 on us in his first game with the Jazz Ant Simons is ballin He going in tonight Mark I would say Ingles hitting 9-10 from 3 after his sub par season would also be similarly depressing. He is currently shooting 100% 5-5 fg 4-4 3 5-5 from 3 Good Time, the movie that left the Safdie Brothers make Uncut Gems is currently available on Amazon Video Wow end of this EMU game is nuts Their QB just punched a Pitt player and slapped a ref lol God Uncut gems Its the greatest film ever made!

Hoooooooly shit uncut gems is really something That ending was fucking nuts Bucks -11, heat -4? Giannis is day to day Shit. Wish I knew that last night. Not gonna ride your Hornets Mark? I feel like OKC is bad enough to take the hornets seriously and put a whooping on them Similar situation with the suns Thunder looked like dogshit last night vs Memphis Why are the 76ers only -3 favorites against the magic OKC on a back to back? Yeah they are. And idk about philly I love how anytime im checking the Liga standings at work, im really just displaying a picture of a man getting his ass eaten https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/uncut-gems-julia-fox-dominatrix-high-school Yea Julia Fox is booming Was that ass real?

Opposite of the Phoenix game In Phoenix Now we are 9th Lol What a shit season The team poster is sick tho Melo knows he pissed this one away Was still in full uniform when we walked in Just got out what the fuck happened?! Blazers blew it. Now tell me what happened with that gaggle of balloons They dropped them! Except one got stuck and stayed up there alone. I will call him Meyers. Blazers were up by fifteen, Melo wanted to score 20 all of a sudden and went 2-12 through the next 20 minutes Terry putting Moses brown in for the last 52 seconds of the first half and Phoenix rolling off an 8-0 run was also fucking brutal All the Phoenix points could have been attributed to Moses Sounds like smelo owes me $100 You guys it just hit me why this year sucks The first ever blazers season was 70-71, not 69-70 This 50th anniversary season is a sham! Right. That makes this the 50th season. It hasnt been 50 years! I call sham! Im also upset But its been 50 seasons... Im so confused Isnt that what were celebrating? 50 seasons? Yes Im just lashing out lol Fair Im so pissed. The swings in gambling are brutal. Went from most likely ending the day up almost 1U (fuck you Florid) to down 7.

Rowe* My favorite Kenny Rowe memory. We all know Cam Juarez used to take home some dragons back in the day right. So one night freshmen year he's making out with this chick against the wall at a party and I'm like "got damn, I'm hammered but that chick looks like a linebacker!". Then I look over to my right and directly next to Cam is none other than Kenny Rowe - an actual linebacker! So I could drunkenly compared the two (Kenny and the chick) and I'm like "yep! That chick is massive! Same size" Happy new year to the east coast SuperLigas https://twitter.com/bleacherreport/status/1212237012641681409?s=12 happy New Years Liga Finally seeing uncut gems!

He doesnt understand the beer line does card ? Wow turner is blacked out lol When is Travis Dye gonna fumble? We want the ball? Just bet us first half lol Is arroyo coaching this game still or not? He is Letting it all hang out WE WANT THE BALL WE ARE GONNA SCORE Matt Hasselbeck Mario Cristobal Lol Good to keep defense rested Wisco D will be gassed ? God Im so stoked on our defense for next season already I feel bad for whoever drafts Herbert The next Oregon bust Joey Herbington May be late to the game here but Stern died Yes very sad He will live on in one of the greatest reaction GIFs of all time Ducks out here trying to lose me money Im not but he definitely is Blacked Clayton checking in Its the fucking service here Im not blacked Oh yeah I had terrible service last night too I feel you Cristobal with some soft ass play calling Can we throw it down field Still trying to "establish the run" Yeah what is this play calling. Horrible 4th down call We are so bad at fourth and short ?If youre an nfl team I say bring both these guys in and see who the franchise guy really is Lets gooooo We should just keep running that Herbert TD play it seems to be working Call big boy plays in the huddle make big boy plays on the field Jesus about fucking time We should stop kicking it to them Clayton just streak? Yeah seriously Streak what? Why is everyone just standing around? How are they gonna fuck up this call Guy didnt even catch it! And he was out of bounds anyways Yikes my buddy took Oregon ML 1H. That hurts I too am your buddy Rough one man ? Wisconsins QB has another turnover in him Almost called that make Mark Limp snap ?? LFG Wow Brady breeze WE WANT THE BALL Lets just have our defense keep scoring Why are we still kicking it to them? Kick it out of the end zone. Just took blazers -4 and Lillard over 26.5 What a spot Fucking awesome play calling If we dont call another screen pass well win this game by 40 Lets just keep running it up the middle. Its worked for us so well this year Its either a screen or run right or left at the guards hole Our offense is trash. Im more hopeful for our defense to score and win this game. Jesus Christ Herbert You gotta throw that away man Yea lets get this defensive TD LETS FUCKING GOOO ? Ahhhh Just give it to Herbert! If the arm aint got it use the legs Woo! Herbie looking like Josh Allen He will fit so perfect on the chargers I agree with Simmons that the chargers should get Jameis Yah thatd be dope but if you get Jameis you draft someone also lol You also never let that rookie talk to Jameis Lamar Herbert Baylor +3.5? Or do we like Georgia Im leaning UGA Tinker Hatfield on the field Just dabbed up Herbert How does lillard have 2 at half Let's fucking go ducks I somehow hit them live at +5.5 for +150 too. Never seen a spread payout that big Cristobal is a fucking boss ? Man lol The bucks were up 7 in the first Still hit the wolves moneyline to win 300 lol The fuck are the blazers doing Welp surprise our bench is garb and for some reason the Knicks bench has over half their points Anyone else hit Georgia? I'm up in the air I think Dubov did Im on Baylor Mitchell Robinson is 11/11 Fuck me Blazers are bad Like real bad Not having a back up center is a bold strategy Down 12 to the Knicks somebody needs to get fired calling in sick tomorrow. I now can bet on the Cincinnati game Bench points 49-5 Kill me Down 18 now. What the actual fuck Were worse than the Knicks Melo trailer 3s Not what I want to see At least Melo has showed up, dame and CJ are absolute no shoes tonight They mine as well have not worn shoes thats for sure We really gonna do this roaring 20s thing for the next decade? I am passing on that Its been a day and Im over it Man Not even trying to be mean But the blazers are just fucking awful rn What the hell happened? They dont move the ball at all! Really bad! Its nuts They suck, everyone is hurt and knows this roster is a place holder Is it time to fade my favorite team the rest of the season? Just a shit season Im taking my family to the game on the 26th vs the pacers. Cant wait to get steamrolled. Theres a non-zero chance Nurk is ready by then Roster continuity was good after all who would have thunk it Nurk is a key to getting the ball to move again Bless Whitesides heart hes just not a good passer Ya gimme dame / CJ / (who the fuck knows) / Collins / Nurk against the world Nurk will def be back, Collins not as sure At least this season Bro I thought Collins was like 3 months WTF Collins was 4 and then re-evaluation Yikes So beginning of March is 4 months Its almost worth it to tell Nurk to just take his time even more to come back This years ova They shouldnt sit him if hes healthy and ready to play. Its gonna take him time to get his timing back and shit anyway Do the Paul George. Bring him back for like 10 games limited minutes. Just to get the reps before next season. This season is a wash In positive news, Zion should play this month Zions injury is way more worrisome to me than Nurk Everything Ive read says later this month But obviously a minutes restriction Goddamnit Devin booker you fuck Blew my u6.5 ast with a meaningless alley ooo to Ayton Yeah I believe Zion will play soon but Nurk has been going hard for a few weeks now. I dont see any reason to be overly cautious. https://twitter.com/eneskanter/status/1212772158549692416?s=21 I think the Ducks are still available at +1 or +1.5 in some places tonight Hammer that Lol at fan voting Alex Caruso in the top 10 for guards in all star votes Ahead of ja and Devin booker Jesus christ Just fueling my fire, Gundy. I still think fans should get 0% of the vote. Because fans are dumb. Im voting for Yao Ming baby!! Currently sick on the couch blowing through season 1 of Sneaky Pete This show is great Man thats been in my queue for a while. I love Giovanni Ribisi I should get on that. Im almost done with For All Mankind. I like it. Apart from the whole Scientologist thing, hes great Lol I didnt know he was a scientologist. of course he is. Yea he and Michael Pena are secret Scientologist Fans should get 100% vote All star game already a waste of time I agree with you from the standpoint that it doesnt matter at all and fuck it give the fans what they think they want But these guys get financial incentives for being an all-star And if youre truly one of the best 20 or whatever players in the first half of the season, you should get that money Agree with dubov and it's used in HOF resumes Like would russel Wilson be a HOFer without pro bowl votes? Who knows Great point, Chad. Is Alex Caruso a HOFer? https://twitter.com/chudpawg/status/1212565842619183104?s=21 This is the content Im here for in 2020 https://twitter.com/br_nba/status/1212814949417996288?s=21 I love all star voting trolling because boomers dont understand it and get upset Whos voting for these people... its the internet Dude kids are obsessed with Tacko I swear the Celtics only signed him for promotional reasons lol Caruso top 10 guards Good! Sports is a entertainment business! Give the people what they want! If Boston doesn't have some sort of tacos for tacko type promotion currently in place someone needs to be fired Thats what first and second team is for! The all star game is in the middle of the year!! Yeah all-nba is really more important I think a guard that doesnt get an All Star bonus because that spot went to Alex fucking Caruso would disagree lol Not my problem lol They tied their contract to fan voting Woj doesnt vote for awards out of protest lol They tied their contract to performance bonuses. The nba tied it to fan voting. How is this bowl game rained out on my sick day I woke up from a nap for this https://twitter.com/kingjosiah54/status/1212835159222784000?s=21 I just voted.

Lol IT just shoved a ref and got tossed That was trash. Funny because of his recent suspension tho I mean you just cant get physical with the ref lmao He pushed him then grabbed his wrist It was weird I dont think that was a shove Yes but the ref pretty much flopped lol Ref should have moved out of the way. The ref must have not been laid in the last year lol Is the ref gonna be fined for said flop? Oh no Hezonja is back Hezonja Tolliver on the court together ?????? Hezonja, Tolliver, Bazemore, Trent, McCollum. Thats a WCF lineup imo. Hezonja to his credit

He got dogged on a call. If you guys ever see me bet on a Sixers game you should bet the opposite Lol Lamar just said one of the kids at the kids camp called Hezonja anthony tolliver and they played it off as a kid mistake Kid was 100% talking shit James Harden looks like if you fuck with the create a player options in 2K. That beard/headband/cornrows option is not a good look. Dame over I just need the Celtics to come through Ohio State fucked my parlay Damn makes the ducks look not so bad Wisconsin is a good team But yeah Oregons loss still isnt as bad On the road Dame -> over Jesus Heat out here catching a massive L Celtics fucked this up if I had known Kemba was out I wouldnt have bet them smh Some say the heat already peaked The coolest thing about having Melo is how every visiting crowd starts rooting for him LeBron o26.5? Hmmm pelicans have been playing good defense lately Idk Does Lonzo make 3s? Hes better at them then he is at free throws lol ok so dont bet u1.5 3pm Harden just threw a gorgeous full court outlet to Russ for a dunk. I hate that I liked that. Lmao russ just had a turnover, missed dunk, missed layup Yeah and the amount of social media coverage he gets for plays is absurd Just saw a highlight on ESPN app "Carmelo Anthony makes dunk" You love to see it They just said they expect Embiid to play 70 games this year ??

Wow hit grizzlies +10.5 thank you twitter gods This is a lit drive Bills OC took the training wheels off Josh Dude serious dude looks like cam newton Lol what just happened We all thought the game was over At the Bullpen lol If Josh drives down here and dunks it that may be the end Although I would have loved to heard Steven a smiths reaction https://www.instagram.com/p/B66grOTnN6N/?igshid=1ct5q6pn4t7ae ? https://twitter.com/nfl_memes/status/1213479170728218625?s=21 Bill O Brien unemployment flow Nuk trying way too hard Lotta momentum for the Texans! Goddamnit There it is I just started chanting defense and I sound like the guy from the Rudy gay video Here we go! Pressure creates diamonds! Watson has a pick 6 in him https://twitter.com/shamscharania/status/1213609802976440322?s=21 ?? Ducks BIG win Bills +3.5 looking pretty safe still Scotts bet hits Bout time they started to work the ball vertical Need Houston not to get 2 pt here so that buffalo only needs a FG Man Hopkins putting the moves on white this half JJ deserves a ring Cox just said this but Watson is kinda like Dame, just being a boss despite not having the weapons Need buffalo to tie this up so we get OT Play action bomb to John brown https://twitter.com/hpjart/status/1213584856640368641?s=12 That might be the funniest thing Ive seen in a while lol Why not call a timeout if youre bill o What is going on Wtf?? Kick the ball Cannot believe this Woah How do you not try and kick it That was bad Fire that guy Seeing ghosts Wow can the Texans get a fg now to cover this Gundy Im sorry bro thats a brutal way to lose Nothing like the ol prevent sack lol 54 yarder vs 4th and 27!!! Dude thank god im not actually a bills fan they are distaugut It was a 59 yarder Distraught Come on bills d hold them in fg distance This is epic Ball was on the 42 yeah? I would still rather try that then 4th and 27 Same same I need them to get a first down For the cover Field goal ruins it Come on big stop and a fg !!! Hes short! Bring out that FG kicker! Dont be an idiot BILL ?? WHAT THE FUCK BILL WERE BACK https://www.instagram.com/p/B658g30AUk1/?igshid=l70d0ex5v2xl WTF!!! Nooooo Lol why wouldn't you kick that Bill a legend Omg
 What Now we need a bills FG!!!!! BILLS My bet be damned, I hope the bills win this game so bill o Brien is publicly shamed This is crazy these coaches are RETARDED this game is nuts Calling OT I cannot believe Houston didnt kick that fg Seriously Brock. What a dumb call Like sure you leave them 90 seconds to go the length of the field a Td beats you but a FG drive starting at the 30 is way easier To tie With no timeouts Insanity! OBrien has +3 bills This is insane Wait so he goes knee down but gets touch mid air Then its where he lands? Man this is hilarious Please Hauscka Buffalo Wild Wings What a start to the playoffs This is the game that gets billy fired America deserves Ot Lol booger really said get a few yards then spike it on a 3rd & 10 play. That'd be a turnover bro 19/19 vision THE GODS DEMAND A SACRIFICE Omg Lets go!!! Lets gooooo Lol wow Bill o Brien you is really dumb Always take the points!!! Wait what happened Im in the bathroom Is they were playing the saints Id go for that fourth But its josh Allen and the bills offense They arent build for the two minute drill Totally Plus the Texans have a good D "we want the ball and we're gunna score!" It's always so hard playing on your heels when a team only needs like 30 yards to get in FG range No matter who wins the other side is going to say they should have covered Playing D with 75 yards behind you and knowing the other team needs a TD to win is much safer Good think cowboys aren't in it Dak would have fucked up that coin toss for sure Damn there goes the cover prob Only josh Allen can save Texans betters This is unreal Buffalo is gonna pull this out They got all the momentum Brock! Only thing the texans can do is try to take it back I guess!! What the hell kind of tackling is that Fly route to the fullback ?? Its third and long dipshit! Nuh uh Wish this game could end in a tie Or have watt and buffalos champion fight to the death That was a former top 10 pick whiffing that tackle dubov lol Joe Tessitore def thinks hes a poet Some Tebow time on the last throw Another 3rd and 9 This game is comical Such trash Bills +135 live bet rn Kenny stills game winning TD I can feel it +145* Lol Booger drew a dick haha 190 Act now hurry!

The beauty of this stage of the game Stfu Bills +215 ML Rn juicy Haha no actually it was 29 yards in the air. Pretty deflating Do you think Deshaun wouldve competed for the QB1 job at Beaverton or would he be guaranteed backup? Omg Lol dont you just kick the field goal here? Run the ball three times Missed FG way more likely than a fumble imo Miss it!!! JESUS CHRIST FIRE BILL O BRIEN RIGHT THIS SECOND Lol DRIVE BILL O BRIEN TO THE AIRPORT RIGHT NOW AND LEAVE HIM ON THE TARMAC IN HIS HOMETOWN Houston is the home team Man that was some horrible football the last 20 minutes or so Who do the Texans play next, regardless of the team you gotta hammer the shit out of that line Bill o Brien is a DUMMY yeah no shit thats why I said in his hometown.

Small balls Vrabel! This game is so weird No pts in the 2nd half The lien may come down to a pats 2 pt conversion Shoulda put in Mariota. Loving the drama for the ATS This is why you gamble Vrabel out thinking himself Bellicheck gonna pounce Yeah he just fucked em Omg I love this Its like auburn Alabama ending Wtf is going on God fucking dammit You come at the King you best not miss Punter got some huge nuts on him Vrabel ?? Imagine if the pats were doing this People would be livid Here we go Brady. Is he a HOFer? Idk but get this cover for me and he's in in my book What the actual fuck is happening?

Jesus Christ Edelman Pats did it in season Vrabel learned it from Bellicheck Omg They can give it to Henry 3x and feel good about it You're kidding me Pats really going out sad Smh Hey hawks just jumped to +1? Did I miss something? Still see -1.5 -1 bovada ?^biggest headline of the week: General assassinated^ Jesus that punter is a machine Why would you not have Edelman deep to fair catch that Wow. Brady with a jamies ending to his Pats career Holy shit Cbs with this fake Brady retirement hype Romo is playing it up Incredible. Give me a break Under is in. Got a titans ATS, Texans push and live teaser. Today was a good day Ian, Sami Dehaan amongst 5 perfect records left Vrabel is such a shit coach. Lucky win Lol what? Please tell me you don't think Vrabel is a good coach lol I mean Vrabel has had good defenses and his team plays hard Hes a defensive coach What else is he supposed to do? He's just not a great coach overall imo. He was about to get fired this year before he benched mariota No coaches really do well without a competent QB Marcus was definitely not that I mean he made multiple bone headed calls this year too I just think he's clearly a lower tier coach in the league Ok so hawks just dipped to +1 This is like. Vegas thing right? No its -1 Or is there a major injury ? ? Somethings up.. ?????? Dubov and I were just discussing it, this is very weird Like who could be hurt to move the line in such a way ? They could have taken some monster lays on the eagles ? Interesting Wow between 5 casinos all different lines between +1.5 and -1.5 https://www.oddsshark.com/nfl/odds/line-history/1232790 Glad I live bet the titans in the 2nd quarter to recover from making the Titans a lock in Brocks playoff pool lol Is Lockett out or something That or as Brock said they got a major money bet on the eagles Kevin Hart?

Hey man, that 2 trillion dollars in shiny new military equipment doesnt pay for itself Honestly the fact that its tax free (effectively for us) is the best part of this shit wait you dont itemize and report your wins and losses? Oh god dont tell my secrets I have a family If Hemingway said that cigarettes are the most beautiful form of suicide, then sports gambling is a close second Im sorry but there is nothing beautiful about me pacing around my house at 12 am yelling at the refs over during a suns kings slugfest https://twitter.com/theangryameric1 Follow this guy and start throwing some coin at 3Q nba over/unders In the spirit of David stern https://twitter.com/TheSteinLine/status/1214263943537025025 Its time to order a drone strike on blade *Vlade Giving Bogdanovic to the Lakers is a WRAP lol Vlade is a lakers double agent Ok pacers -5 at hornets, jazz -3 at pelicans, bucks -7 at spurs Been waiting for this!

Wow I held on to first place by 5 points this week God dammit Milwaukee https://twitter.com/anitakumar01/status/1214398302336278528 Did he offer to nuke them? ? So fellas Someone hacked my debit card and stole 330 bucks I get it back but still creepy However I suspect Bovada or betonline got hacked Yikes Lol on the other hand, I somehow didnt notice this lol so it feels like free 330 bucks But still Keep an eye out Weird flex, but ok Finally that was used appropriately I remember feeling like my account looked a littler lower but it was the day after I went out and have so my cards on autopay So I just bricked it off lol Brushed* Panthers are dumb lol Ive heard some nutty stuff about Ruhle I think its a good hire Because Mike McCarthy was a great hire? Lol there arent a ton of great candidates out there Maybe these teams should try hiring somebody who hasnt been fired by another team ??????? One mans trash is another mans... well, trash. Its still trash. Doesnt history say that hiring an unknown is a gamble that has big upside? Whats the angle hiring a known quantity that failed? Id love to see a breakdown actually Yeah basically fuck you, Rengel! To be fair most good coaches have been fired and will in the future I dont hate Mike McCarthy really Hes better than Jason Garrett I just like taking the shot on a young guy like Ruhle who had been great everywhere hes been and hes wanted to get back to the NFL Mayo mike got a Super Bowl Yah after looking ver rules resume no reason not to give him play Also Ruhle is apparently known as a crazy good playcaller Mayo Mike had peak Rodgers Thats almost a knock but I do agree Mike is a good hire. Browns shouldve hired him last year. PFF made a good point Its basically a huge mistake to hire a defensive head coach Absolutely Someone will hire Salah and its a mistake Youre better off hiring a John Harbaugh/Tomlin type guy who is more of a CEO Never was a specialized coach Because anytime you get an O coordinator that is good he will leave the next year Yup And offense > defense for the most part Vs rams No one is trying to hire wade Phillips as head coach Its crazy how this year So their coaching staff is solid I mean Wade had great defenses in LA The rope five passing offenses are all not in the playoffs The tough part is our personnel is not going to hold up with his system Running is back I think KC is objectively a top 5 passing offense Ehh Ian irk Idk Lombardi talks about this but you pass to score You dont run to score Its tried and true Hence why everyone scored less than 20 pts Lol What i said is just a truth, take it however you want I think youre right Brock But still crazy Yeah this is also a year with teams like Seattle and Green Bay that are not good Theyve taken advantage of shitty schedules and won close games but they didnt do anything amazing all year Ive been telling packers fans all week that they are the most overrated team out there I mean youre a hawks fan.... Look in the mirror They have beat Kirk cousins twice I love how Washington had both Mcvay and Shanahan inside the organization and didn't promote either The Seahawks are worse than the Packers in terms of fraud teams Hawks have a better resume TBH I agree id rather take a shot on an up and comer than some retread But both are truly frauds No way look at the schedules Lol we beat the Vikings niners rams and eagles Our schedule wasnt that easy The rams beat themselves in that one but okay lol Packers are the biggest frauds in the league clay They're losing this weekend Yah the packers played straight TRASH Im not hyping the hawks TOO much Again look at the wins they couldve gone either way for almost all of them But the packers schedule was unbelievable They got the win obviously thats the important part But they only led at half 5 times All year Their point differential is also worse than GB Schedule obviously matters there First off I didnt compare the hire to McCarthy- I think hell be alright but not much better than garret. Second off winning at temple and being a top 15 team in a shitty big12 isnt an amazing resume Lets see what happens theres no one in the nfc we cant hang with lol Yah but Russel Wilson is actually a legit reason to be overperforming The track record is there to say thats a real advantage in those games I mean you couldnt hang with the saints with teddy at home I mean how many teams are definitely better than the hawks? Baltimore and KC? No one could! Lol Rams beat them We went 11-5 dude Yah you always split divisional and rams went to the Super Bowl last year How you taking the packers wins over the ahwks Talk about beating yourself look what happened in sf Or against sf KC, Baltimore, Green Bay, honestly I think Tennessee beats Seattle Packers signature win is a close game vs Matt Moore They got BLASTED by 9ers Totally agree the packers resume is bad Its a relief that the rest of your nfl opinions are this dumb good god Hawks went 1-1 and prob should have gone 2-0 if a flag is thrown The hawks just have ride Russ Thats it yuop Literally thats it lol Somehow year after year that is enough I mean most years theyve got more This is JUST him its ridiculous Hes a creepy child molester but god hes amazing as a football player Whoa whoa Russ is a man of god lol Packers are trash tho man Packers are trash too, I agree Lost to the eagles and niners who Seattle has already beat I just think at Lambeau, Hawks cant run the ball Cant wait to see you all eat your words Hawks wouldve lost to the eagles with wentz Fwiw Packers will be in super bowl Our receivers are actually a strength this year tho They deserve a lot of the credit for Sunday. Metcalf was inhuman. Honestly there arent many teams this year you can truly trust Thats the crazy part Everyone wanted to crown the saints ass... look what happened Ill crown your ass Rengel Yall see this? ? GO WILDCATS! Lets go to a game in Seattle The Dragons are such a blatant ripoff of the Portland Forest Dragons Amen haha Those games were dope I think I have a Bovada future that they will go bankrupt before July 2020 McMahon put in too much money for that to happen but who knows Yah I mean they will go bankrupt just a matter of when I love the NFL and im so ready for a break when the season is over Everyone will watch opening weekend and never think about it again Houmans $20 bets on the dragons should keep it afloat https://news.nike.com/news/liverpool-nike-partnership officially official Big moves ? How is Gettlemen still in charge ?These type of headlines are indeed the worst, but this is such a JJ Watt tweet it hurts lol Man that is all around just a dumb moment ABC13 Houston wouldnt even bother tweeting about that trade if it was any other Dash player Man the comment section on that one is probably the worst Hey if any of you have a sapphire reserve card you can now get 2 years free of DASH Pass Please elaborate on what DASH pass it is Ah nvm i googled Damn that is kind of wild actually I refuse to pay for food delivery but Ill do anything if its FREE I love me a deal Dubov And free is the best kind of deal Also Dubov great segue from Dash player to DASH pass That is exactly why I was so confused Haha thats what reminded me Chad Lol Im just burnt from every critical tweet ending with Do Better.

Basically he entered an additional 150 entries or whatever through her Sexism! Just bc a woman won she might have cheated! Come on draft kings Do better. No but heres the thing Of the combined 300 lineups , 298 were unique. Thats the smoking gun. If she did it herself thered be duplicates Yeah no I know They probably did 2 the same as a throw off the scent type move lol I mean if two people colluding is cheating then they cheated Like when u cheat on a test and get a few wrong Yeah but you also dont each get to take the test 150 times Does that mean you cant pool money to buy powerball tickets?

Houman May be removed before ww3 I hit it +150 live That was such a backwards play. CJ stood in the corner jab stepping like MELO and MELO pulled up for a big shot like CJ. I just dont want melo on this team Yes mark I cannot believe this What did I just see Wtf we won??? We had no business winning that game Wow. Melo with the chalupa game winner That was incredible He should go to the all star game Melo the ?? At least the 3 point contest CJ was so fucked if he kept the ball. RHJ had him completely frozen Fucking Cavs shit the bed in the 4th and ruined my parlay ? What if none of those boxes apply? Impossible! Wheres the box for I dont like watching his style of basketball I dont know basketball Thats not the same thing ????? Not even close I also dont think I was disrespecting him I just dont want to watch him play ball ? Nobody had a problem with this opinion when he played for Houston or OKC ??????? No ones arguing that. His journey brought him into our hearts He had to learn that this is home I will never Ever Say a single bad thing about Chris Paul again I almost hedged out when Gallinari was ruled out Line flipped from -2.5 OKC to +1 OKC But then I was like nets have dropped 6 in a row fuck it OKC goes down 7 with 3 and a half mins left Paul goes to fucking work Is RJ Barrett gonna have more than 13.5 points tonight And bam CP3 is having a nice season OT cover How happy did Tristan Thompson getting posterized make Kevin Love feel Also the Melo buzzer beater must have felt so good for the red bull hoops social media manager with all those months of Meyers dunks Sweet release Rengel I totally meant to like the Rudy Gay shout out in the moment. But the Superliga was flooded with messages in that moment Ukrainian airline crashes as its leaving Tehran airport Upon takeoff ... due to technical difficulties Trump and Ukraine involved in a pointless war together is the darkest form of poetic justice Lol man Hassan got away with the moving screen of the century lol To be fair thats prob the first time Ive ever seen refs give whiteside a break ? Its gonna hit! They're saying that plane might have been shot down by an Iranian missile now I dont like the source on that info Al hadath man lol The half court challenge sponsored by mondolay bay Is really called the Mandolay Bay Shootout Jfc I was there the week after that happened for a fight, so fucking eerie, Vegas was a ghost town. I know someone who was at the concert It sounded fucking nuts Id be broken after witnessing that Id be like Gunz after 4 shots and 3 pipe rips Go ahead and spoil uncut gems. I seent it Has anyone not seen it? Is the lockout period over? Dylan spoil it for everyone I havent seen it but Ill just put the group text on do not disturb until I do ?Look at this mixtape list lol Isnt this rich homie Quan?? I dont know just saw on twitter lol https://twitter.com/RealSkipBayless/status/1214766789608869890 What an icon That mixtape list is all Skip Bayless about LeBron https://vm.tiktok.com/XM6K9Y/ That video is all time Almost like real life South Park Happy Wednesday Rockets -8 at Atlanta, bucks -13.5 at warriors, mavs -3 vs nuggets Like those, added Charlotte +2.5 vs raptors as well Ok yeah Ill do that too 4 way parlay hits at +1250 ????? Threw 10 on that also My lord these last 2-3 days was legit a set up between Iran and USA. Iran legit wanted their commander dead, told USA about him and they finished the job. Iran strikes back by firing missles and kills/injuries no one. Im sorry but I smell a set up here. Both countries win because they feed their media nationalism and the people feel prideful Ridiculous You think there was a back room deal between US and Iranian intelligence? Houman when your drafted into the republican guard, will they let you be a medic? Yea Lets not forget this commander was legit a genius. He pretty much single handily thought of a plan to stop isis in front of Putin. Iran knew this guy could overthrow their govt via military coup Wow love this take Houman You think there was a back room deal between trump and anybody? Im not saying trump had any idea of what was actually going on. Im saying through intelligence this was done It was a win, win for both countries. Iran couldnt kill the commander because was he loved by the people Houman these are the hot takes I come to the group chat for The only way the Iranian regime will be gone is via another country (yet to happen), the people (theyve tried multiple times and failed) or military coup (which couldve easily happened since the commander was loved) Hoomie over here acting like this was Presti and Morey Don't forget, trump also benefits from media attention moving away from impeachment ?? Exactly Dont believe what is being said on the media. If Iran wanted to kill they would Is that a threat, Houman?! Who is the moderator of this chat? I feel unsafe! There will never be a war between these two countries. And now he can use this as a way to call Democrat's unpatriotic. Did you see how many republicans ran to Fox News to call dems terrorist sympathizers Houman you got me fired up! Both are way too powerful to cause massive destruction Chad look at it from the other side. The people of Iran are also fired up. These are the same people that have been pushed the poverty because the govt screws them over But for a moment they didnt care. And became prideful of their country The Superliga is so living sports betting and international power plays, nobody can stop this chat *solving Ledlow's next message for us is gonna be "I hear you guys are the most knowledgeable foreign policy chat around, and Chad tells me Houman discovered the Trump Iran quid pro quo" Houman Heat nets on Friday? ?International crisis = business opportunity Always be closing ?? Look at this doofus What a fucking idiot God please no more ads that look like PSAs Theres so many ads like that I never have any idea what they are for lmao Also Im gonna go see Gems today at 12:15 Im seeing it at 6! Finally. Midnight tonight the lockout ends All spoilers will be dropped Just catching up on these messages . Between Houmans warmongering statements and Dylans Venmo payments were definitely on a list ?? Not to mention Im venezuelan.

Fucking Colby and his little man syndrome uncle https://twitter.com/DickieV/status/1214741955864862721?s=20 is this the best tweet ever? Long story short Colby's uncle was one of my high school football coaches. They made us bleach our practice pants every weekend and checked for cleanliness on mondays. I couldn't bleach mine cuz I lived in the country and have well water (you can't use bleach in hard water). So they check our pants and mine were stained from mud but still clean. I told him I had well water and he lost his shit. Thought I was telling some tall tale and made me bear crawl all practice Lmao fucking dickie v Chad the only reason I transferred from west Salem to south Salem was so I could hang out with friends with better cable Is LSU -5.5 a lock?

Its like they studied the tendencies of this chat and made it a movie Gotta do a Celtics ML/Tatum/Brown parlay And the tip The tip is my favorite part Julia Fox is mine I actually saw a stat that Andre Drummond wins the most tips in the league. It's over 60% That ass is mesmerizing Julia's. Not Drummond No I didnt meet him he was talking about the news anchor You dont know that Chad Have you ever seen Andres ass? Ian my buddy seems to have a lot of faith in Miami tonight ? Ballsy play Jesus Christ My goodness Indiana is not a team I would bet against at home * George Takai voice* oh my ! Wait wut Theyre 15-4 at home Were 9-9 So you're saying I shouldn't trail him? Lol Not for 1200 lol I might hit the heat just bc its fun to bet on your team in a pick em Twitter ?? says Orlando -9 Same tout who had Knicks +10.5 vs Clips I have one pick tonight (Boston -6.5 at home vs spurs) just bc Vegas $$$ was horny for it Im keeping it light tonight Only putting in 9 picks and a parlay Lmaooo https://myaction.app/AlexDubov ? The KU pick makes me super uncomfortable, though. Probably gonna lose that parlay. I went 1-4 last night. On top of my Pats loss my account is dwindling I just reloaded the sports book for some nba plays tonight because the movie has me back on my bullshit Going to make some strategic picks after smoking a joint I have a 4pm meeting which is when most of these tip off. Hopefully I have some good news when the meeting ends. Write your bets on the whiteboard when it starts and everyone will have something to follow along with ? Wow my Wiz vs marks Magic Lets rumble Youre fucked *scans Wizards roster*
Gary Payton II is gonna make you wish you never bet on basketball! The Mitten! Looks like Joe Moorehead as the new OC ? I kinda like Dallas tonight too Looks like we all like the Mavs tonight! fire it up! Consensus pick! Go mavs! Lukas total is 48.5 WHAT A little too rich Points/reb/ast Oh shit I thought you meant points No its 29.5 I think Yeah same lol I was about to hammer the under on that lol You cant rile the dogs up like that Gundy We were ready to pounce Im sorry you guys To be clear - I love my son and I think hes absolutely capable of scoring infinite points But, like... 48.5 is a big number. Im gonna do some digging on other team props ? I did Celtics -6.5, Pacers + 1, Mavs -3 and Rockets -7.5 Or Pacers -1 excuse me Also Tim hardaway Jr Over 13.5 at even money Denver is gonna make anybody but Luka beat them Gundy got the itch again! Millsap our! Out! Huge! Nice find Im actually going to do that also Had to throw 25 on my squad even tho its dumb (maroney take) I just bought back a parlay to bet that hardaway number Lol I was looking for a sabonis rebounds prop but couldnt find one God the spurs They finally figured it out Also part of the reason I bought back my parlay is I didnt wanna double down against the spurs Yeah I bough spurs -3.5 to get myself out from under A lot of room for a double loss here THJ has 7 early in the 2nd Q Why is adderall trending The Seahawks finally get busted? I just looked its trump sadly ?? Smh As I said unequivocally earlier Heat were a smart bet tonight Did anyone know you can cash out live on ML bets? Good on your friend chas Chad* Luka at halftime with a total of 25 on p/r/a Yeah he started with $100 yesterday. Won like 3 tennis bets and a CBB bet. Then turned his heat pick into 2 grand Unreal Wow ?He just cashed it. 2 grand richer Wow Iconic Also not sure what the blazers line is tomorrow at Minnesota but KAT is almost definitely not playing Im hammering that The wolves have been the worst team in the league for like a month Also just did a live Pelicans -3.5 vs Bills/Bucks -14 at Warriors/Knicks +14 at Jazz parlay *Bulls not bills 4 more points for THJ Really sick that Kemba missed three games for me and then got ejected in his first game back ?? The Celtics got absolutely served tonight They were the 1 part of my parlay I felt great about too Faaahhkkin Celtics And Kansas who I was nervous about is up 20 #gambling Damn chad Proud of your boy for his heat bet Who bet the magic. Who bet the hornets! Who can fuck off THJ ?? Lol Christ Lost em all Wow Terrible picks! Just kidding we were trending great The mavs completely fell apart and rockets missed by 1 I know lol what the fuck happened Yeah and harden went like 2-18 in the second half lol Whelp Sco bucks https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1215119622367850496 Uhhhh Man lol That is so outrageous Is he saying they misread him Or he got the words mixed up lol Idk but maybe fade the Cavs? I dunno man Im thinking hit the rockets -2.5 tomorrow Im probably a moron but I just think this recent win streak is inflating the thunder They wont have gallo or Noel I watched them without those guys on yesterday and they needed Chris Paul to go Benjamin button with 3 mins left to push Brooklyn to OT My only worry is Russell Westbrook is gonna throw up 60 shots to try and make a point I went 0-4 tonight tho so stay away from my picks lol ?First the in the league in FT % gundy! That's basically 50/40/90! Lol how can you guys shit in Jamal Murray for his bad prediction when like 3 people in this group picked the blazers to make the finals Rude. ? Lol said Portland was going to the finals in this chat? Without nurkic Nobody And even if that was true, the Jamal Murray prediction is worse lol Im so fucked in o/u. Shouldnt have paid so confidently. Lol cam is a spurs run away from the coveted 0/10 Ian has been exposed Now we have to pronounce his name Yan Because thats the cuck pronunciation Wow lol Brock zuckerberg over here accessing my personal data! ? Lol This is the front of espn. Westbrook @ OKC tonight One thing is got certain Westbrook is taking 90 shots tonight And hes gonna strangle at least 3 fans to death before the game. OKC is so much nicer to the guys who left after KD its weird PG basically requested a trade and got a tribute video Lol yeah but Westbrook is hunting for one drunk white large scale industrial farming sales rep that calls him a bitch and then he will eat his organs They should let Westbrook fight fans at half time ?Sandler rocking the the Howard Ratner look full time now That movie made me want to use lotion on my face three times a day My only spoiler is his son looks like a yung Mark Omg Thats so true FACTS Im not Italian/Jewish The kid has incredible flow https://twitter.com/chold/status/1215320744332341248?s=12 Trade whiteside for Love asap Then trade Bazemore for Harrison Barnes. We're in business baby Holy shit, PAC 12 Refs for the natty! Its gonna be a shit show Yes! Also I want to ask the liga a trade question CJ for Ben Simmons you would do? Yah for sure The media is banging the Trade Ben Simmons drums Absolutely gundy Amen Except I keep thinking about the Marc Spears interview when he said trading CJ is the one thing that could drive Dame outta town Is Dame that tied to him? So would Ben take over as PG? With Dame off ball? They'd probably split ball handling duties. But dame plays great off the ball Youd just play both Simmons would create so many transition opportunities At that point it's more of "get the 5 best players you can on the court at the same time" And Simmons can guard the 4 He could even guard the 5 in certain lineups Dame, Simons, Ben, Love, Nurkic ?? SHEESH I'm sure Sideline olshey is on it!! Guys just finished dont fuck with cats last night whats the spoiler moratorium on that one I saw it Pretty neat! Im gonna pass! Have at it! Space u kinda reminded me of the primary character Ian I see you laughing at our trade proposals Enlighten us Who's Ben fetching Dragic and Winslow? Bens gonna stay Philly prob goes to the finals The sixers would be so dumb to trade him IMO They can legit beat Milwaukee Fair I don't think they trade anyone either If he were to sit out and demand a trade I dunno maybe CJ and your first rounder But if they are that dumb! They could do worse than CJ In hope that its in or near the top 10 Mike Leach to Mississippi state thank god Never having to go against Leach again >>>>> Holy shit for real? That is surprising to me Damn Get him away from the Pac Yeah this is def good for us Why would anyone want to go to pullman now? Party and live off the radar? Fair ESPN hired Omar Raja?? Does that mean he sold HoH to bleacher report entirely? I suppose so? https://awfulannouncing.com/espn/omar-raja-officially-joins-espn-steering-network-social-content.html That's wild. Good for him.

Yeah I think You havent truly lived until you win a bet on a Ben simons free throw What in gods name is Portland doing haha Playing Jaylen Hoard We're getting a top 5 pick at this rate Lets do it If the warriors can do it why cant we Honestly just throw the season away no harm no foul Watch us pull a Bs win over the bucks on Saturday shut dame down too This is our lot in life 25min a game I agree Dylan Not even tank or trade or panic Just keep everyone fresh for a dynamite 2021 Honestly what's dope too is we could finish with like the 10th worst record and get the 3rd pick. With the new flat lottery odds Forgot about that But we should most def tank Trade for Love Yeah sure Rest everyone Wait for next year Trade bazemore too. He's an abomination How do we get Love tho Im confused Whitesides contract lol If theres a way Im down Yeah whiteside and a first or something Cleveland just wants cap relief at this point And general relief They just need to rub one out Guys who cares about the Zers the season is lost ducks cut it to two by half Not a very pretty game tho God we suck! Random but just watched short term 12 - great movie if u havent seen it Damn Rengel that looks gay AF Ill give it a try Payton had POY buzz coming into tonight and is getting dominated by Mannion Im a Mannion hater so this is driving me nuts Little ginger fuck Payton needs to fucking figure it out. Get in the lane. The entire team needs to box out All year thats been the issue. Its absurd Ive not seen a team this bad at rebounding under Dana. Also we are longer and taller than ever before yet terrible at getting butts to nuts Real question: have we been good at getting butts to nuts since Kazemi? Not the climate to ask that question Erik NFaly! The Mali Monster! Yes we have actually Dana is normally great Also gunz you bring up Kazemi, but its our namesake who was the rebound god, Joevan. I love tigers! Rawwwwrrrrr! I love bill Lol yes He tried giving Mario Jr. peanut butter and Cristobal grabbed Jrs hand and was like no dont eat that Kazemi the ??

She used to do the same thing with a telegraph back in the day We get in the car and my mother in law just goes Clayton doesnt get to pick Christmas movies anymore Billy W talking about Casey benson is making so happy Peanutbutter does not expire. Giving up offensive boards on free throws is fucking inexcusable Not for the ducks Also Zona can shoot this is what I worried about. Offensive boards and threes off of it And we cant shoot today for some reason ?? ?? fire LETS GO BABY https://twitter.com/KendrickPerkins/status/1215478322638938112 I will say Dubov, we are winning the rebound battle More offensive boards but god it doesnt feel that way several of ours were bad put back attempts it feels like Ducks just not running an offense again Always fun to see I fucking hate the 3 man weave at the top of the key Its nothing but a waste of time Yeah its awful Yea were gonna lose We also have 9 in n out threes I think tonight Yeah theres been a lid on the bucket Zona just is not a better team but Oregon just didnt bring it tonight Josh Green is sick Shut the fuck up Gundy Not right now Pritchards first FT attempt tonight Im just saying its not like it was just us being shitty, AZ has talent motherfuck. God dammit Payton you little fuck You cant go 38 and a half minutes without a FT attempt. Were the refs on the take??? I mean he was shut down by everyone tonight This may be the worst overall game weve played this year It was a lot of dribbling up top and not a lot of penetration Now, admittedly AZ is more athletic than any team weve played besides maybe Memphis It just doesnt seem like they screen for him I have no idea why The weave shit is awful I want PP to drive the lane When he gets into the paint good things happen for Oregon I wanna shove nico Mannions head in a toilet PP with the dirk omg WOW PP with the block too Why not use the timeout on the board Or on the collect God I love PP We know bro I need a 3 jersey Out of context Gundy Were talking about basketball here BIG FELLA ON THE FLOOR!

We need to trade Hassan and baze Why is baze so fraudulent If not I hope we have a plan on a free agent in 2020 of which there are few https://www.instagram.com/p/B7IERu3pF6u/?igshid=zgooungn4z79 This.

Fuskies not so much Who we getting Not official but Joe Moorhead the MSU HC that was just let go is interviewing today. Imagine a deal will be in place this afternoon Munich Cowboys great! Kellen Moore will be the Cowboys HC in 4 years Rengel....I said this like two days ago MY GOD If youre going to Rovell me at least kiss me first Just saw a license plate DEM B*YZ Not saying I predicted it. Was more commenting on the huskies hire plus Wikipedia blurb in the tweet Idk about that. If they are doing well on offense, mayo mike will stick around right So whats Moores upside there Im all in for Moorhead its so weird they fired him at MSU, Leach is probably going to be exactly the same Hes a good offensive coordinator and Cristobal will not infringe on his play calling Also NO MORE PISTOL Thats probably true - hes in a good spot tho and I feel hell do big things with confidence from McCarthy Yah but again if Mike is getting fired, Moore is getting fired also imo Kellen Moore also was good this year as OC, the D was the problem in Dallas Yah but Mike is an Offense guy Kellen is the New Jason Garrett lol Yes but its sounding as though the plan is to possibly have Kellen calling plays For sure but theres a reason Jerry didnt let him really explore other coaching availabilities Well see if it happens tho, Kellen also is a good clock management guy and could be that for Mike because he struggled with it In your scenario he gets the boot with Garrett, so theres that Fair point Rengel but garret is a do nothing coach Clapper, bring dignity to the org https://twitter.com/javierveg_/status/1215667183231160322?s=21 Be Jerrys dog Theres something to be said for a CEO type coach I dont like mike but he actually has a philosophy Which Garrett ultimately became You can put the blame on him but their d was bad too this year Who is gonna be the QB for the Ducks next year Shough Whats his deal he good? Whenever he came in he looked in control. Had a td pass in usc game and can also run like Herbert was at end of season I just did some googling, apparently hes Herbert 2.0 https://twitter.com/alekarend/status/1190838219434147840?s=12 It could be Ashforf Ashord Ashford* Fuck my texting I think hell come in for run plays on occasion Im glad theyre going to open it up, but Im with Rengel Shough is the favorite Just got my season tix locked up! I think he could be next Russel Wilson So he can molest young boys? All American in both baseball and football Okay so just minus the chimo vibes got you Shough has a big arm and seems really poised Im excited to see what he can do Mainly because Im also in the goat that Herbert struggled to read defenses and made poor decisions a lot Appreciate everything he did, Im ready for a new era 3rd year plus got to learn from Herbert and has chemistry with Pittman who will be our number 1 Plus Im sure hes throwing to Devon Williams as we speak haha Guys I may shit my pants on the way back from the gym right now Herbert more like Bustbert I just want everyone to know this wasnt my plan My wife made this vegan noodle dish last night it had a ton of pepper flake in it and Im being ravaged inside You will enjoy that short term 12 movie then lol Pepper flakes dont make you shit your pants The Caucasity of that statement Idk what it was All that fiber bro!

Unbelievable lol Y'all are gonna have a great 8-8 2020 I cant believe they called it a first down Imagine being that bad at your job Not even a judgement play That was 2 yards of ass Looked like a first down to me He was clearly a whole yard short There was a freeze frame where he barely had his helmet on the yellow line Zero percent ball over ? I'm not mathematician but that was horeseshit You cant see the ball or his elbow from that angle Yah but the ball is in his stomach Evens out with the missed review in first half Sure just always annoying to end the game like taht They prob would have won the next play Unless he has the ball in his helmet its not over Yeah cmon the ball was at his stomach chest area You think the ball is at the top of his face mask Dubov? Lol He holding it with his teeth? https://twitter.com/davemasonbol/status/1216552584640679937?s=21 lol Im kidding man I dont care either way One thing that they should do is if something goes to review is throw out the ruling on the field Like say it doesnt matter. Go make the call with the review evidence For sure. That was totally a call where without anything previously affecting our judgement, you would look at objectively and say it's short But with the whole conclusive shit it completely fucks up the decision making Oh idk if we can say without a reasonable doubt All I know is beyond a reasonable doubt Jared Goff was sitting at home tonight He was in the super bowl last year Are you a hawks fan chad? I legit had no idea thought broncos maybe. Clayton with the bandwagon call out? Stirring the pot! Lol seattle is the pnw team mr LA Just better hope the hawks can be that lucky with a bad pt differential and lots of close wins again next year. Thats repeatable, right!?

Damn if they included the #1 pick I guess that's a conversation. That would suck for the rest of the league once Curry comes back lol Is there a prospect in the draft that compares to KAT tho is the question They probably take wiseman Yeah right.

All those are dope jerseys besides kyrie I dont really think so Good for Zion Surprised by Durant a little, I guess everyone thinks hes a ?? Probably indirectly. I imagine it's a part of Basketball Related Income which is negotiated in the CBA. I think players owners split it 50/50 Yeah but I dont know how that gets distributed All I know is Meyers doesn't have to worry about collecting any of that ?Damn I didn't realize Draymond was having such a killer season. Can't believe you left him off the west all star roster gunz Whats the NBA leans today Im cold but I went with this today ? Feel like healthy raptors against the Wizards are a loco *lock https://twitter.com/mikegarafolo/status/1218289226455879680?s=21 Ugh Gundy I got the raptors too which is not good news for you the way Ive been picking lately Heat +1.5 @ Thunder
Hawks +8.5 @ Spurs
Memphis -9 vs Grizzlies
Blazers +7 @ Mavs
Raptors -11 vs Wiz Great news for the Blazers: Dame is questionable with the illness that took out CJ and Whiteside last week Very tight Am I a bar person if i take Lukas over tonight? No not at all I won a parlay betting hornets against the blazers this week Hornets were +9.5 its different Its 30.5. I dont really like any nba bet tonight https://twitter.com/davemasonbol/status/1218320629281316864?s=21 Did not see this coming Sharps on McGregor? Fucking bulls ?? I just bet on portland ML I can feel it in the air Dame is getting the team to turn around Lol I just layer the points on the mavs but its a 10 dollar bet Do you guys think betting gets harder in the middle of the season? I feel like its getting easier Ive had way more feel for the last few weeks than say, November and early December Not I I just feel like there was a period where the heat were like 9-1 ats at home Depends prob on if youre a watch the season to suss out the iefficiecies And then everyone caught on Or if you come into the season with a take you want to let ride Yeah I just think like for instance Bucks were getting a lot of 12.5 or 13.5 point lines at home against bad teams Now its like -17.5 Look at the pins, if you thought they sucked coming into the year you could have faded them so hard By end of season they had a great ATS record Flying out of Newark tomorrow You know Im placing a couple legal jersey bets as soon as I get to the airport Do you have to come back to cash them? Yeah But its fine People just take the subway one stop into jersey Place their bets And then ride directly back without leaving the station ^ its normal behavior for space Its like a thing now lol its hilarious https://time.com/5759895/new-jersey-sports-betting/ I only did that once lol Amazing lmao Btw we love this start! Lillard vs Donkic is fucking high art rn They are fucking dancing RT if youre mad at yourself for not taking Luka and Dame over Jesus Christ can we just let these guys play basketball ? Omg I mean guys Im sorry But holy fucking Donkic Donkic vs giannis New Kenton vs Durant Lebron* My son Hes special Lol -7.5 hit Im 10 bucks richer Yo Im doing beta blazers Tix booked https://www.instagram.com/p/B7clrLuAE9w/?igshid=gll1jnzb3iax I'm fully on the Ja hype train Hes playing with a huge chip on his shoulder. Reminds me of Dame. Love to see it. Grizzlies were so lucky to bail on Conley and get a way better replacement at the perfect time. They got a nice young squad Those jerseys are also some of the sickest throw backs Everything 90's gives me a boner lol Also question. Did Jj make that gimme dunk? Thats puberty returning to remind you of what a time you used to have. Timberwolves pin stripe jerseys, hawks throwbacks, jazz, magic pinstripes, raptors throwback Honestly bias but our cream throwbacks make me, well you know, cream. Hawks anything but current jerseys are ight I hate their geometric BS Those cream ones are v sexy So are the red rip city kits we rocked against Houston The white piping is cum worthy Blazers can honestly do no wrong some are just better than others . ?Never forget the reason for the season boys Placed my jersey bets Bucks -8.5 toning chiefs -7.5 on sun No Niners! Blasphemy I dont trust crapalo Ill take all JCSL Packers smoke @ +7.5 https://www.instagram.com/p/B7eFpr3JxqV/?igshid=1djyer1nd0h7t Fucking STAND UP man right here Also GTJ is only 21?! Fuuuuck. What are we doing wrong? Everything I guess. The ducks making tsahonis look like Sabonis https://twitter.com/ShamsCharania/status/1218648441619873792 ?? Even Harrison Barnes is an upgrade I would gladly do The black swan is back !!!! Lol we got swanigan back Wow Ooopss I got my swanigan back Ariza? Ya Wow Lol Wenyen Gabriel too He hasnt been good in a minute The blazers now have two of my three least favorite players in the league Cams like wait when did swanigan leave? At least tolliver is gone ? (Gabriel) Is Ariza any good still? He was never good And I will boo him endlessly for that bullshit he pulled on Rudy Addition by subtraction? Maybe Ariza will start https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1218649718290440193?s=12 Sick trade Jody That alone might get him to play like he gives a shit Wrong player Shoulda got Barnes Dumb trade Terrible Short sighted All about cutting money I'm sure Dame is hyped! Jody Highroller she is not Dame about to be tip toeing in his Jordans out of Portland What would you guys want a guy that averages 15 points on 46% shooting when you could have a guy that averages 6 points on 38% shooting! Turn on the tank Just let dame and cj go on vacation Seriously. Tell Nurk see you in October Guys you know how I am so Im just gonna say this. Ariza is in the 90th percentile in the league in transition scoring this season per synergy And Bazemore was... Definitely not that high in transition This ultimately sucks but it could be an addition by subtraction move. And Swanigan at least gives us another center So if we trade Whiteside soon we arent totally fucked on the glass #Savior ? Listen man anybody who is above 6-9 would be helpful This is how bad our big man situation is after Whiteside Pritchard going full Dame ? Pritchard!!!! Huck the fuskies https://twitter.com/JustRyCole/status/1218649570076286976 This is phenomenal news for us This guy is literally always wrong about everything Why dont you respect black journalism gunde? It is known Wait is this for real? Im drunk and confused by this man always being wrong. Hes wrong about everything, meaning our trade is good if he thinks its bad Science Gunde already said it. Its because hes .. Ah I get it now. Thanks Alright first jersey bet cashed go bucks Its great lol bc when youre tempted to rebet it all on a night game You cant lol Holy shit usc https://twitter.com/dangerusswilson/status/1218713746152886277?s=12 Holy smokes. Packers gonna roll Heat at PK tmrw. Should I? Wait what Russ isn't playing? Wow I'm drunk Fuck Russ Same here Chad dont worry Gary Trent breakout lol Happy birthday https://twitter.com/cwmwrites/status/1218739283491729410 This is hilarious lmao They introduce Myles Garrett and totally ignore baker mayfield Brady here ! So sick He definitely loves Conor Aligning himself with the Boston Irish ?Guys I'm watching Vail v. Breckenridge semi pro (pay to play) hockey right now in a 250 seat arena. Not sure how I ended up here lol But go Yeti's Dude youre like in the early story stages of one of the mighty ducks movies This is like an SF twilight zone. Every dude either works in construction or is a ski instructor and lives in a $2 million house The ones that really bring in the dough out there are the timeshare sellers ?It's getting rowdy af in here ?Look at this sign I found Lol Ok Ill bite Why are you there!? My friend said they had a free place to stay in Vail, so I packed up the car and came for a ski weekend haha and apparently this is what the locals do on Saturday night Holy fuck thats awesome MCGREEEEEEEGOORRRRR McGregor and the Under hits Murph and I getting paid! 40 seconds Wowowow I officially hit 5k in bovada bets to cash out my money lmaooo $500 in the bank lets go Mark I am So fucking proud of you My cheeks are red! Mark that's incredible What was the deposit https://youtu.be/Oxc7OsK5kUs $250 I also cashed out a bunch of side bets But yea its been a slow crawl since the duck game God dammit that's beautiful One wins, we all win I got $100 up to $650 then lost it all lol So I tip my cap to you So youre banking 5K? Lmao no I had to make $5000 in volume To hit this bullshit bonus cap And I finally did it after 18 days Im gonna die tonight!!!!! ???????????????????????????? Wow It snows in Vail too in case you guys were wondering Hey chad Lol i was gonna finish that sentence but Im lost https://twitter.com/seanfennessey/status/1218783354528526337?s=21 ?? 1917 +185 on bovada right now Hahaha Ian I was on the edge of my seat ? Nothing like celebrating a McGregor victory like lion king on Disney plus So guys my new chronic optimism blazers take is that theyre gonna eventually find a way to trade Whiteside for Gallonari and then trade someone else to another team to get under the tax Thats kinda the only positive outlook Because its pretty clear Jody wants them not to pay the tax this year So the Kevin Love dream is dead ?Good Morning Duck fans Gundy that's a depressing scenario Jody fuckin sucks Don't get cheap around the edges during dames prime Okay lets not get too excited here Bazemore was trash or dont get cheap ever But especially when dame is in his prime Brock that's not the point. Bazemore was indeed trash. But we could have used his expiring deal to trade for an upgrade to the roster. Or use in a huge trade with whiteside. Instead we cut costs Completely wasted an asset (his contract) not him And two second round picks Thats a pretty steep cost Ariza might actually be better than Bazemore for the money He also only has 1.8 guaranteed for next season So we could easily throw him in a trade and the next team can buy him out so he can be on the Lakers or whatever Ariza is def better for the money. Also there is no guarantee Whiteside wont be moved Kevin love is not a HR deal and there really isnt anyone obvious for them to acquire And the question with Gallo is whether OKC would want Whiteside. Chris Paul might kill him Anyone want titans -7? +7* Im on chiefs -7.5 Did not expect the line drop Same Niners up to -8 though So Im happy Packers win 28-27 Im in on that final score Rengel I believe in the over 46.5 Boss will not get to meet his idol in the White House Dude that motivation is key to the Niners pass rush https://twitter.com/onionsports/status/1218978983750045696?s=21 Teaser. Chiefs -1.5, niners -1.5, KC tenn over 45.5 +150 I threw the Heat in a couple of NFL parlays today for the culture Titans! Lets go! Cut that dick off baby! Somebody cut that coaches dick! *cuba gooding JR voice* Go Titans - nfl will not allow a titans niners super bowl I know that Who wants sf -7.5 I want gb! How much Houman And its -8 now $20? Jesus the chiefs D are undisciplined Lets go Wow thats killer Why They got 3rd and 22!!? Wow that was such a brain fart Yeah brutal Chiefs were down 24 last week theyre fine Any team that can score 28 in a quarter always has a shot *at covering -7.5* Yeah Id like to see another score this half Its not like weve never seen Andy Reid collapse in a huge game lol The line is down to -1.5 KC gets ball At half right? Yup Ooww they score here its game imo Mahomes just gotta feel out the defense Wow Holy shit that was atrocious d God hes so sick Wow Yeah mahomes wasnt down with Lamar Jackson being the next big thing Here come the chiefs Good news niner fans. The nfl still wants a rematch of super bowl I in their 100th season ? Peyton gives the zers an A for trade Pelton* Yeah I mean Ariza can be better than baze period If Melo can have a resurgence so can Ariza https://twitter.com/barstoolbigcat/status/1219019062837116934?s=21 Dunk it on then right here Need anyone to score half a pt here Wow Game LETS GOOO Thatll do pig Lmao punting! ?? Trust the Hooker How do you not cover the fake Lololol
 That was amazing Fuck here we go Interestingggg Here comes the backdoor! Why not go for two?? Andy Reid is to busy putting in his Uber Eats order to get a first down 11 point game is better than 12? Yah but that means you have to go for two later!! This is basic shit Whattt Challenge that Line on the line here Kinda looked like the last pi.. Now for the main event If any of you salty Seahawks fans want pack +8 let me know Nah packers are trash Packers are frauds They are indeed but the Niners also lost to the falcons And its still Aaron Rodgers All of the JCSL analysis on the Packers wasnt wrong last week. Its that you guys overlooked how bad the sea chickens were Eh hawks were a play away and you know youd rather play the packers than the hawks Not wrong! Youre talking too much shit mark! Im so nervous This will end poorly for you! Packers are like a knuckleball pitcher tho, they always play the game on their terms Stay humble Niners will probably crumble Its too good to be true I dont know what that means Gundy but Im on board Wheres Jeff Garcia when you need him! Alright Im up 100 with Dubois bookie but you cant cash out unless youre up 200 So Pack money line Lets go! ?You think the nfl has one of these ready to go for the Niners? I doubt it https://twitter.com/rob_lowder/status/1219037451328487424?s=21 Jerry rice springing the whole field in a suit pregame? May have to take the alternate line Niners -21.5 +400 Cool you won some Super Bowls in the 90s. Welcome to the 2000s That guy was one of the worst Seahawks receivers ever Boyz 2 Men the last time the Seahawks were relevant I meant 49ers sorry lol Once saw them at the Santa Maria county fair for free ?Bought to eat 7 of these like Raheem mostert Oh shit you making xiao long bao???

What is goodell ordering up Lol how are the 49ers just running the same play every time and dominating Looks like Vegas is gonna let the sharps set the line Silicon Valley has a lot of money so he is fine with the packers not being able to tackle See who gets hammered at a pick em Yah I saw a pick Pretty cool lol kittle doesnt have a yard Chillin lol Derrick Henry who?!?!?!? https://twitter.com/davejorgenson/status/1218533383195721728?s=12 This is amazing and Im not gay for Harry Potter like Aaron Hernandez Finally hit my teaser I need one more TD and Ill be in the money Here comes the backdoor!!! Nahhh Lets gooooo It would be ironic for the packers to get screwed on a first down spot I forgot that I had a $50 parlay on both the favorites Today was a good day! I had one plus the over I lost 10 units today but now Im tripping on acid so the day isnt a total loss ?Ok I may have been wrong about a few things today https://twitter.com/covers_vegas/status/1219091133227159552?s=21 Rob Lowes character in 911: lone star is a 9/11 hero that moves to Texas.. like really? Lol So far what Ive gathered from this show is that hes a 9/11 hero who just got diagnosed with lung cancer and his gay son overdosed because he proposed to his black boyfriend and he said no Theres a lot going on Is that the acid talking or is this the actual plot ? Tomorrow. For Martin. Unclear, Mark. I havent paid that close attention just thought tugging on the heart strings of the 9/11 memorial was kinda tacky. Twitter search has shown some ppl canceling their series recording over the gay kiss tho I also just plunked down lots of money on chiefs -1.5 and the over ?Lmao I didnt even see this Please dont bet chiefs through bookies Thats just disrespectful Whats the over?

But the line about him being in peak physical condition was kind of ironic Literally what I was thinking I also had the weirdest dream last night and you all were in it. I get back from being out of town, and my entire house was robbed. My neighbor ended up being the mastermind behind it all. But I invited the entire JCSL over for a football watch party, and we all show up at the same time. My house is completely looted. Dubov goes "where's the TV?" And I'm like "I got robbed!" And he goes "I know but like, how are we supposed to watch the game?". I'm like "dude idk I got Fucking robbed!". So someone else says "alright dude we'll we're gonna go to a bar and watch the game but lemme know if you need anything" and everyone left lol it was a trip Classic chad inviting people over for a watch party without a tv https://twitter.com/bleacherreport/status/1219319958070611968?s=21 Good article https://twitter.com/shaunalshatti/status/1219323234593587200?s=21 Matt please let us know when its a done deal so we can get rich ??

Great pod this week Really agree with arnovitz What's the scoop I havent listened yet Silvers failed proposals and viewer interest in actually watching nba games Pretty funny clippers lakers dont care if the other team gets the first seed Literally no difference Yeah I mean it does make a difference in who you play Do the clippers really wanna play the lakers in the 2nd round? Why does that matter I guess it doesnt matter much because Kawhi would probably rather do it earlier I guess Yah I mean you out it off so they can possibly lose but I dont think either of these teams fear the Jazz/nugz I dont think they do but I think the clippers are vulnerable against those teams Clipper could go PG plays round 2 kawai plays round 1 The clippers can def beat the lakers but I think someone else in the west could beat the clippers but not the lakers in a series, if that makes sense That makes sense although I do not believe it ?Just catching up. Not so sure about your trump take Dubov Goddamnit I shoulda known not to bet against Atlanta on MLK Day The raptors are BLOWING this lol Im listening now Brock and windy calls Adam Silver a cuck in the nicest way possible The play-in tournament is cool Mid season tournament isnt as cool as the play-in, IMO I think Windys points are more prescient than Arnovitz, IMO. The NBA has quality products to market that they look over.
